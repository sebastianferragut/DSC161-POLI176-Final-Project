MEJB2542019154	Joe Biden	2019-04-25	I’m Running for President.	Charlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history.We know it by heart:We’ve heard it so often, it’s almost a cliché. But it’s who we are.We also haven’t always lived up to these ideals , Thomas Jefferson himself didn’t.But we have never before walked away from them.Charlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years. It was there, in August of 2017, that we saw Klansmen, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis come out into the open , their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, bearing the fangs of racism. They chanted the same anti-Semitic and racist bile heard across Europe in the 1930s and 40s.They were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued. A brave young woman lost her life.And that’s when we heard words from the President of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of our nation. He said there were some “very fine people on both sides.”With those words, the President of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had seen in my lifetime.I wrote at the time that we were in the battle for the soul of this nation. That is even more true today.I believe history will look back on four years of this president , and all he embraces , as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Who we are.I cannot stand by and watch that happen.The core values of this nation , our standing in the world, our very democracy and everything that has made us who we are , are at stake.Folks, America is an idea.An idea that’s stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth. It guarantees everyone is treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor.And it instills in every single person in this country the belief that no matter where they start in life there’s nothing that you can’t achieve if you work at it.That’s what we believe. And above all else , that’s what’s at stake in this election.We can’t forget what happened in Charlottesville.Even more important, we have to remember who we are.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/im-running-for-president-of-the-united-states-d55abc51eae0?source=user_profile---------160----------------------------	EmptySummary					Charlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history.We know it by heart:We've heard it so often, it's almost a clich�.

MEJB972019153	Joe Biden	2019-07-09	A Contest for the Future	1968 was one of the most tumultuous years in the history of this nation. My only two political heroes , Martin Luther King, Jr, and Robert Kennedy , were killed in April and June of that year. My city of Wilmington, Delaware , like many other cities , was in flames.This was the context in which in felt called to public service. It is why I chose to leave one of the oldest law firms in Delaware to become a public defender, to defend those who could not afford to defend themselves. It is why I chose to run for the county council to combat redlining and discriminatory housing policies. It is why I eventually ran for the United States Senate at the age of 29.When I arrived in the Senate, the world I entered was a legislative body where segregationists held some of the most powerful positions and the Southern Manifesto was woven into the political landscape of America. I quickly came to realize that in order to truly serve your constituents and get things done, it is imperative to engage with those who may not see the world the same way as you do. Sometimes you may find their views to be downright repugnant.During my time in the Senate, I took those segregationists on many times and I won many times on legislation that mattered to me, such as repeatedly reauthorizing Voting Rights Act. I chose to work within the system to make the system better to get things done for the least among us. Faced with a choice between doing nothing and acting , I have chosen to act, and for that reason I’ve witnessed and worked to make sure that the America in 2019 is a very different place than the America of the 1970s.In the midst of this presidential election, my experience has been weaponized to use against me, generating attacks on my statements and votes on busing in the 1970s.There are many who would prefer to dwell on the past, but I am running for President to be the candidate for a better future. A candidate who will give every child in America the education they deserve. I have always firmly believed that a child should not have to get on a bus to attend a good school because there should be first-rate quality schools in every neighborhood in this nation, especially in 2019 America. I am the candidate that will work to raise the minimum wage to a livable wage and ensure proper pay for public school teachers. Additionally I will initiate the largest infrastructure program in our nation’s history and school construction and facilities will be a significant focus of that program. All these programs are intertwined and will work together to close the wealth gap by starting at the source , our children.I know that plenty of other attacks have , and will , come. So let’s get some facts straight.I am not beholden to banks because I supported the bankruptcy bill. I believed I was taking a bad bill that was going to pass without my vote and making it better.With regards to trade; I don’t believe there is a stronger voice for working people in this country than mine , and we better wake up and realize that either we will set the rules of the road in the future or China will , to our great detriment.Recent attacks on a woman’s right to keep personal health decisions between her and her doctor are offensive to me. I will move to codify Roe vs. Wade if this Court strikes it down.I voted for the Iraq War , that didn’t stop President Obama from turning to me to handle Iraq once we took office , giving me the responsibility to bring home 150,000 combat troops from Iraq , which I did.I don’t believe there is anyone in this race more prepared to lead the world today than me. That may sound like bragging. It’s not. It’s simply what I believe.If you look at the issues I’ve been attacked on, nearly every one of them is for something well before 2008. It’s as if my opponents want you to believe I served until 2008 , and then took the next eight years off. They don’t want to talk much about my time as Vice President.It was the honor of a lifetime to serve with a man who was a great President, an historic figure, and most important to me , a friend. I was vetted by him and selected by him. I will take his judgment of my record, my character, and my ability to handle the job over anyone else’s.I know there are many who want this campaign to be about the past. My past. I get it. That’s the game. But this isn’t a game.We all know in our bones this election is different. If we don’t beat Donald Trump the character of this nation will fundamentally and forever be altered. We can’t let that happen. I’m determined to make this election about the issues in front of us , not behind us. I know the history of this country. I’m amazed at how far we’ve come. I’m even more amazed at what I know we’re capable of doing. If we come together as a country there is nothing we can’t do.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/a-contest-for-the-future-a28d5f8d928c?source=user_profile---------159----------------------------	EmptySummary					1968 was one of the most tumultuous years in the history of this nation.

MEJB2072019152	Joe Biden	2019-07-20	Let’s Get Real About Health Care	Authored by Kate Bedingfield, Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Directo.Let’s get real about health care. No hyperbole. No “scare tactics.” Just facts, accurate historical context, with a side of reason and logic.For decades prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we had a broken system that had been limping along for over a generation, leaving the most vulnerable among us behind. Costs were skyrocketing, pregnant women could be denied health care coverage, cancer patients were forgoing life-saving treatments because they blew through lifetime caps mental illness was going uncovered and thus untreated young people were being kicked off their parents’ insurance before they could access quality jobs The system was broken.It had to be fixed. President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Leader Harry Reid and many courageous Democratic members of Congress got it done. Some called what was passed “incremental” change. Well, ask the 20 million Americans who got coverage who didn’t have it before if this was “incremental” change. Or ask the more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions who for the first time ever got protected if this was “incremental” change. For many Americans, Obamacare was transformational, not incremental.But the process was painful. You may remember the explosive hearings, the Tea Party town halls, the close vote counting. How many times was it called dead on the 1-yard line?Since then, Republicans have tried again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress and the courts. So far their efforts have failed. Trump is in court again with a legal argument that conservatives have called specious, trying to accomplish what he couldn’t in Congress , repeal Obamacare. And, after facing defeat after defeat in two arenas, President Trump has tried to do all he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act on his own.With all of these renewed threats, as Democrats we should be presenting a united front to protect the law we rallied together to pass (with unanimous Democratic vote counts in the Senate). And P.S , have we forgotten what happened in 2018? Defending Obamacare is how Democrats took back the House. And it’ll be one way we take back the Presidency from Trump.Joe Biden has been very clear: he will not support any policy that means getting rid of Obamacare. He will oppose Republican efforts; he will oppose Democratic efforts.A few of the Democratic candidates for president are suggesting a complete overhaul of our health care system, and changing it to a “Medicare for All” plan.We all understand the appeal of Medicare for All, but before we go down that road we should take a clear-eyed and honest look at what the plan actually says and what it will cost.Here are the facts, a Medicare for All-type plan will:And, let’s look at what Joe Biden’s plan will do:(There’s a lot more in Joe Biden’s health care plan , and I urge you to read all of it , but I hit the highlights).Everyone running for President (on the Democratic side) wants to get to universal health care coverage. We all believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. We’re unified on that principle. But we differ on how to get there (and that’s OK! Healthy policy discussions are the backbone of democracy , we should, in fact, have more of these).Joe Biden thinks the best way to achieve universal health care is to build upon Obamacare. Roughly 20 million people already gained coverage because of it.So let’s have the debate: build upon what’s been working in Obamacare? Or scrap it altogether and start from scratch? Joe Biden looks forward to continuing that conversation on the trail, and we’re confident that once voters look beyond Twitter and catch-phrases, they’ll see which plan will better put us on a path to the goal we’re all striving towards.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/lets-get-real-about-health-care-4b33dee673bd?source=user_profile---------158----------------------------	EmptySummary					Authored by Kate Bedingfield, Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Directo.Let's get real about health care.

MEJB1592019146	Joe Biden	2019-09-15	Joe Biden’s Remarks at the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing Memorial Service	Occasionally in life, there are moments so stark they divide all that camebefore from everything after.They stop the clocks. They rip away the trivial from the essential. They force us to confront difficult truths about our institutions, about our society, about ourselves.10:22 am, September 15, 1963 was such a moment.Even at a time defined by racial hatred. Even in a city then described as the most “thoroughly segregated” in the United States.The assassination of four joyful and innocent young girls preparing for Sunday school. The indiscriminate cruelty of a stack of dynamite. The appalling impunity afforded to the murderers while a grieving community cried out for justice.It pierced us.Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.Their murders laid bare the lie that any child could be free in America while oppression’s long shadow darkened our cities and fear ruled our countryside.These children of God, they’d be almost 70 now.Each was an individual life rich in promise, stolen. Each a future, unfulfilled.Sarah Collins Rudolph, Addie Mae’s sister, survived the bombing, but she still carries the scars of the blast.For Sarah, and for so many of the family members here, this is not a symbolic loss that transfixed the world and inspired a nation.It’s personal.And even 56 years later , it’s tragic.When you lose a child so young the loss is always punctuated by questions.What would she have looked like?What might she have done?What memories will never be?The heart breaks anew whenever you remember what incredible potential and opportunity was denied.But we must never let ourselves forget.As Dr. King so rightly proclaimed at the funeral service: “Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream.”And indeed, a blast that took aim at the foundations of this community in 1963 blew wide the door for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.It shook my generation to its core and helped us realize it wasn’t enough to work on the fringes of the movement.The struggle against hate, injustice, and institutional racis,must be the unrelenting work of our lives.It summoned us to battles many of us have been fighting for half a century , for voting rights, civil rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity.More than five decades after we lost those four innocent girls, we gather on this hallowed ground conceived and constructed by black dreams, raised up by black resilience, sanctified by black blood and tears.We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery brought to these shores 400 years ago, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black people in this country.The domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding.Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past.The same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway, and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons declaring it would stop a quote: “Hispanic invasion of Texas.”We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation is that we still strive to.“We hold these truths to be self-evident ,We’ve never lived up to it. But we’ve never walked away from it.It’s what unites us , the American creed.It’s one of the most powerful ideas in the history of the world, and it lives in each and every one of us.Our belief in it is what compels us to act.We remember the hope of scripture , “hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate.”And the Lord may be gracious to us.It’s in the wake of these before and after moments , when the choice between evil and good is starkest, when the pain pierces the heart the deepest, when what’s at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.That’s when as people , and as a nation , we are defined.In my life, when Dr. King was assassinated, and my city of Wilmington burned, I faced a defining moment.To stay at a big law firm or leave and become a public defender.I left and took the first steps in a life committed to civil rights.Before and after, my life would never be the same.When my first wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured in a car accident, I faced a defining moment.To walk away from public life or stay and serve.I chose to serve. Before and after.My life would never be the same.When my son Beau died, he made me promise to stay engaged, don’t retreat.And even though I know there is a hole in my heart that will never heal, I’ve kept my promise. I’ve stayed engaged.A defining moment. Before and after. It’s never the same.Charlottesville. When I saw the torches, when I heard the chants, when I saw hate on the march, I knew it was a defining moment.For me. For this nation.Silence would be complicity.Before and after Charlottesville. This nation will never be the same.The Psalms tell us: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning”.The philosopher tells us: “Faith sees best in the dark.”Now hate is on the rise and we are at a defining moment.Who are we? Who do we want to be?After Charlottesville, I said that I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And I say it again today.We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.And here at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there’s no more powerful reminder of what’s at stake.And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response.It’s a battle we have fought again and again. It’s a battle that has claimed countless lives.Hate only hides, it doesn’t go away. If you give it oxygen it comes out from under the rocks. It can be defeated or drowned out , but never vanquished.But we also should realize that revulsion to hate at its ugliest can summon the very best in us.The coddling of white supremacists so heinous it cannot be ignored by any decent American presents an opportunity to continue to make progress against systemic prejudice.I believe the American people are ready, just as they were with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.I am sure, in those first hours after the bomb exploded, it was hard to see through the smoke and rubble to a day like today.As Dr. King eulogized those girls, perhaps not even he could have imagined the day, nearly 50 years later, when this nation’s first black president would award them the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our highest civilian honors.It is only with persistent effort.It is only with fortitude in our actions.It is only with faith in ourselves and the future that may yet be.That change comes , sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once , and progress continues.My good friend Senator Doug Jones is here today. He never gave up on justice for Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.It didn’t matter that almost 40 years had passed , doing the right thing doesn’t tarnish with time.We know we’re not there yet , the work is not done.And it’s hard, heart-wringing work.But we are almost 330 million Americans. And I know there is nothing we cannot accomplish if we stand together.Stand against hate. Stand up for what , at our best , our nation believes.Honesty. Decency.Treating everyone with dignity and respect.Giving everyone a fair shot. Leaving no one behind.Giving hate no safe harbor.Demonizing no one , not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other.Standing as a beacon to the world.Being part of something bigger than ourselves.That’s who we are.And that’s why I believe so passionately that we have got to work to bring this country together again.That is the work demanded for rebirth and renewal.56 years ago, the Sunday school lesson was “A Love that Forgives.” Reverend Cross never got to give his sermon that day.But it’s a lesson that’s subsequently been delivered by Reverend Price, and will be again today.We must choose forgiveness. Again and again. And that takes incredible strength.I will never forget traveling with President Obama to meet with the grieving families of Mother Emanuel in Charleston, South Carolina after Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a friend, was murdered along with eight of his parishioners.I had only just lost my own son, Beau. But I wanted to be there with them.And I watched in awe as President Obama addressed the community, as he sang with them, Amazing Grace.As he offered the healing and solidarity and leadership and that our nation so desperately needed.I witnessed that amazing grace again when I stayed on with Jill to attend the Sunday service at Mother Emanuel.As I sat through that service, it buoyed my own family in the loss we had suffered.And I was astounded by the amazing grace of those parishioners, the families of the victims, when they chose to forgive the killer.To bind up the sharp wounds and the wrongs done to them with compassion.To meet hatred with peace.To be able to live again in community after such a horrifying rupture.Their example is a moral challenge to each of us in our own lives.So my prayer for all of us this morning is that in this moment, when our nation must once again decide who we are and what we stand for, we will remember the strength of this community.We’ll remember the moment time stopped. And then we’ll remember everything that came after.And we will choose once more to fight for our shared American dream.Mr. Mayor, Reverend Price, and to all the “Beloved Community,” thank you for allowing me to be part of this important commemoration.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-at-the-16th-street-church-bombing-church-memorial-service-9541875a2d96?source=user_profile---------152----------------------------	EmptySummary					Occasionally in life, there are moments so stark they divide all that camebefore from everything after.They stop the clocks. They rip away the trivial from the essential. They force us to confront difficult truths about our institutions, about our society, about ourselves.10:22 am, September 15, 1963 was such a moment.Even at a time defined by racial hatred. Even in a city then described as the most 'thoroughly segregated' in the United States.The assassination of four joyful and innocent young girls preparing for Sunday school. The indiscriminate cruelty of a stack of dynamite. The appalling impunity afforded to the murderers while a grieving community cried out for justice.It pierced us.Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.Their murders laid bare the lie that any child could be free in America while oppression's long shadow darkened our cities and fear ruled our countryside.These children of God, they'd be almost 70 now.Each was an individual life rich in promise, stolen. Each a future, unfulfilled.Sarah Collins Rudolph, Addie Mae's sister, survived the bombing, but she still carries the scars of the blast.For Sarah, and for so many of the family members here, this is not a symbolic loss that transfixed the world and inspired a nation.It's personal.And even 56 years later , it's tragic.When you lose a child so young the loss is always punctuated by questions.What would she have looked like?What might she have done?What memories will never be?The heart breaks anew whenever you remember what incredible potential and opportunity was denied.But we must never let ourselves forget.As Dr. King so rightly proclaimed at the funeral service: 'Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream.'And indeed, a blast that took aim at the foundations of this community in 1963 blew wide the door for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.It shook my generation to its core and helped us realize it wasn't enough to work on the fringes of the movement.The struggle against hate, injustice, and institutional racis,must be the unrelenting work of our lives.It summoned us to battles many of us have been fighting for half a century , for voting rights, civil rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity.More than five decades after we lost those four innocent girls, we gather on this hallowed ground conceived and constructed by black dreams, raised up by black resilience, sanctified by black blood and tears.We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery brought to these shores 400 years ago, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black people in this country.The domestic terrorism of white supremacy has been the antagonist of our highest ideals from before our founding.Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, and lone gunmen. And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past.The same poisonous ideology that lit the fuse at 16th Street pulled the trigger in Mother Emanuel, unleashed the anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh and Poway, and saw a white supremacist gun down innocent Latino immigrants in an El Paso parking lot with military-grade weapons declaring it would stop a quote: 'Hispanic invasion of Texas.'We have not relegated racism and white supremacy to the pages of history. But the greatness of this nation is that we still strive to.'We hold these truths to be self-evident ,We've never lived up to it. But we've never walked away from it.It's what unites us , the American creed.It's one of the most powerful ideas in the history of the world, and it lives in each and every one of us.Our belief in it is what compels us to act.We remember the hope of scripture , 'hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate.'And the Lord may be gracious to us.It's in the wake of these before and after moments , when the choice between evil and good is starkest, when the pain pierces the heart the deepest, when what's at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.That's when as people , and as a nation , we are defined.In my life, when Dr. King was assassinated, and my city of Wilmington burned, I faced a defining moment.To stay at a big law firm or leave and become a public defender.I left and took the first steps in a life committed to civil rights.Before and after, my life would never be the same.When my first wife and daughter were killed and my two boys were badly injured in a car accident, I faced a defining moment.To walk away from public life or stay and serve.I chose to serve. Before and after.My life would never be the same.When my son Beau died, he made me promise to stay engaged, don't retreat.And even though I know there is a hole in my heart that will never heal, I've kept my promise. I've stayed engaged.A defining moment. Before and after. It's never the same.Charlottesville. When I saw the torches, when I heard the chants, when I saw hate on the march, I knew it was a defining moment.For me. For this nation.Silence would be complicity.Before and after Charlottesville. This nation will never be the same.The Psalms tell us: 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning'.The philosopher tells us: 'Faith sees best in the dark.'Now hate is on the rise and we are at a defining moment.Who are we? Who do we want to be?After Charlottesville, I said that I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation.And I say it again today.We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.And here at the historic 16th Street Baptist church, there's no more powerful reminder of what's at stake.And no more poignant example of what is demanded of us in response.It's a battle we have fought again and again. It's a battle that has claimed countless lives.Hate only hides, it doesn't go away. If you give it oxygen it comes out from under the rocks. It can be defeated or drowned out , but never vanquished.But we also should realize that revulsion to hate at its ugliest can summon the very best in us.The coddling of white supremacists so heinous it cannot be ignored by any decent American presents an opportunity to continue to make progress against systemic prejudice.I believe the American people are ready, just as they were with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.I am sure, in those first hours after the bomb exploded, it was hard to see through the smoke and rubble to a day like today.As Dr. King eulogized those girls, perhaps not even he could have imagined the day, nearly 50 years later, when this nation's first black president would award them the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our highest civilian honors.It is only with persistent effort.It is only with fortitude in our actions.It is only with faith in ourselves and the future that may yet be.That change comes , sometimes slowly, sometimes all at once , and progress continues.My good friend Senator Doug Jones is here today. He never gave up on justice for Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole, and Denise.It didn't matter that almost 40 years had passed , doing the right thing doesn't tarnish with time.We know we're not there yet , the work is not done.And it's hard, heart-wringing work.But we are almost 330 million Americans. And I know there is nothing we cannot accomplish if we stand together.Stand against hate. Stand up for what , at our best , our nation believes.Honesty. Decency.Treating everyone with dignity and respect.Giving everyone a fair shot. Leaving no one behind.Giving hate no safe harbor.Demonizing no one , not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other.Standing as a beacon to the world.Being part of something bigger than ourselves.That's who we are.And that's why I believe so passionately that we have got to work to bring this country together again.That is the work demanded for rebirth and renewal.56 years ago, the Sunday school lesson was 'A Love that Forgives.' Reverend Cross never got to give his sermon that day.But it's a lesson that's subsequently been delivered by Reverend Price, and will be again today.We must choose forgiveness. Again and again. And that takes incredible strength.I will never forget traveling with President Obama to meet with the grieving families of Mother Emanuel in Charleston, South Carolina after Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a friend, was murdered along with eight of his parishioners.I had only just lost my own son, Beau. But I wanted to be there with them.And I watched in awe as President Obama addressed the community, as he sang with them, Amazing Grace.As he offered the healing and solidarity and leadership and that our nation so desperately needed.I witnessed that amazing grace again when I stayed on with Jill to attend the Sunday service at Mother Emanuel.As I sat through that service, it buoyed my own family in the loss we had suffered.And I was astounded by the amazing grace of those parishioners, the families of the victims, when they chose to forgive the killer.To bind up the sharp wounds and the wrongs done to them with compassion.To meet hatred with peace.To be able to live again in community after such a horrifying rupture.Their example is a moral challenge to each of us in our own lives.So my prayer for all of us this morning is that in this moment, when our nation must once again decide who we are and what we stand for, we will remember the strength of this community.We'll remember the moment time stopped. And then we'll remember everything that came after.And we will choose once more to fight for our shared American dream.Mr. Mayor, Reverend Price, and to all the 'Beloved Community,' thank you for allowing me to be part of this important commemoration.
MEJB3102019145	Joe Biden	2019-10-03	Joe Biden’s Remarks in Reno, Nevada	Last week the House of Representatives opened an inquiry into whether the President of the United States has committed impeachable offenses. Its investigation will focus on evidence that Donald Trump attempted to extort a foreign government , the Government of Ukraine , to manufacture charges against me, to go after my family, and to undermine my candidacy for President. That he corrupted and weaponized key agencies of government to include the National Security Council, the Justice Department, the State Department, and the Office of the Vice President to do his personal political bidding. That he betrayed the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States in service of his re-election. For years, Trump has dismissed and excused Russian aggression in Ukraine, including the illegal annexation of Crimea. And, for years, Trump has made no secret of his desire to welcome Vladimir Putin back into the fold at Ukraine’s expense. Trump and his emissaries have sought, repeatedly, to extort the existential fears of Ukraine’s leaders for political advantage. Now we know that he may have held up political support and vitally needed aid appropriated by Congress to pressure Ukraine to give-in to his political demands. And he personally told the leader of Ukraine that American foreign policy wasn’t going to run through the State Department , it was going to run through his personal, private lawyer who was demanding non-existent dirt on me. And the State Department , instead of carrying out our nation’s foreign policy , was enlisted to do his bidding. People around the president knew that what he was doing was wrong , profoundly wrong. So they tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence. Now because of the courageous actions of a whistleblower, Trump’s scheme has been exposed. He did it because like every bully in history, he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November. And now that all this has come out, Trump’s predictable response has been to attack me and my family. Desperate and defensive, Trump sends one crazed tweet after another insinuating that the whistleblower should be executed, threatening to prosecute the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, warning direly of civil war. He is repeatedly smearing me and my family. His party fans out to carry the smear, are blanketing the airwaves , paid for by the special interests so well served by his presidency. Let me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I’m not going anywhere. You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get. Trump knows there is no truth in his charges and attacks against me. None. Zero. Every independent news organization that has reviewed his charges at length found them to be a flat out lie. Every single one of them. What I did in Ukraine was to carry out the official policy of the United States government to root out corruption in Ukraine in conjunction with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, our closest democratic allies, and courageous reformers I met on the ground. This was a fully transparent policy carried out in front of the whole world. And fully embraced by the international community of democracies. We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pressing them to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do his job with someone who, at the time, we hoped would finally crack down on corruption. Trump on the other hand was secretly putting at risk our national security to pursue a personal political vendetta against me because he does not want to run against me. And what is truly stunning about this are the exhortations involved in holding back desperately needed military assistance and political support from our Ukrainian friends while they are engaged in a live war with the Russians , a war that has cost thousands of Ukrainian lives. This isn’t a game. This is deadly serious. But as we all know all too well, the truth doesn’t matter to Donald Trump. It never has. And it never will. Which is why I do not think the American people are going to believe him. The American people know me , and they know him. And I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against his long record of lying and cheating and stealing any day of the week. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s integrity is a joke. But it’s important to step back from the heated 24-hour news cycle and focus carefully on the larger story. It’s not about Donald Trump’s antics. It’s about what has brought Donald Trump and the nation to this sobering moment in our history , and to the choice facing us in 2020. What has brought us here is simply this: the abuse of power. The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency. The American presidency is an office of immense power. That’s why character matters more in a president than any other office in our government. That’s why one of the gravest threats to our democracy is a president who puts their own personal gain ahead of the public good. And that is why Trump will do anything it takes to hold on to it. We need to be clear about something. The threat posed by this president isn’t just to our constitution. This isn’t just an academic exercise in political theory. A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security also poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives. This was on full display just a few days after the House opened its impeachment inquiry , when we saw a wounded president meeting with the head of the NRA in the Oval Office. Do you think they were talking about the safety of the American people? Or do you think they were talking about how much money the NRA was going to spend to keep Trump in office? What do you think mattered more to Trump? His reelection? Or the safety of our children? Or do you think they talked about Trump protecting the NRA and the NRA protecting Donald Trump? You want an example of what happens when a president puts his own selfish interests ahead of the national interest , when a president abuses his power? I’d say that’s Exhibit A. You want another example? Climate change. It’s not possible for Trump to do any more for the fossil fuel industry. He’s turned his back on the science. He’s pulled America out of the Paris Agreement. He’s repealed the new fuel economy standards that we put in place in our administration. And in return? The money is pouring in. We’re facing an existential crisis. The UN tells us we have roughly ten years to deal with this problem. And he is single handedly standing in the way. And what about health care? Trump has relentlessly , cynically , attacked Obamacare. He has no replacement. He just wants it gone. It doesn’t matter how many people are hurt. It doesn’t matter that it will put at risk the preexisting condition protections that are in place for more than 100 million Americans. It doesn’t matter that women will once again be charged more just because of their gender. It’s an Obama achievement , so it has to go. And, if in the process he can pocket big money for his from the insurance companies, all the better. Or how about his wall? You know the one Mexico was going to pay for. His big promise from 2016. Going nowhere. Instead of comprehensive immigration reform, we have political grandstanding about a wall that , no, Mexico will not pay for , and yes, cruel and unusual policies that separate families and seek to keep kids in cages indefinitely without basic necessities like soap or toothbrushes continues. Donald Trump acts, reacts, twists and turns according to what he thinks is good for him, for his ego, his personal politics, his campaign money. And virtually every day he launches a barrage of tweets to attack, to disparage, to insult, to threaten anyone who does not bathe him in praise. He’s even gone so far as to threaten the whistleblower. Now fearful about his reelection, he is becoming more unhinged. Trump wants a campaign on his terms. He imagines he can pick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat. We are not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for President. That’s why he picked up the phone, called the leader of Ukraine, and pressured him to manufacture a case to smear the opponent he least wants to face. Here’s what Trump and the special interests paying for his campaign know. They know I’ve taken them on in the past and beat them. And they know I will again. They know I’m not just promising change. They know I’ll deliver it. I’ve taken on the NRA , twice , and beat them both times. We made the Brady bill the law. We banned assault weapons. We limited magazine clips. And we can do it again. We took on the health insurance industry when we passed Obamacare. And I’ll take them on again. My plan is to build on Obamacare with a public option. The health insurance companies hate it. That’s why they’ve already attacked my plan. They don’t want the competition that will come from a public option, and drug companies don’t want their profits cut. And here’s what they really fear: they know I can get it done. Not in five years. Not in ten years. Now. Our administration made the largest ever investment in clean energy with the Recovery Act and assembled an international coalition to combat climate change. Trump has abdicated American leadership on climate. I will reassert it. I’m not surprised Donald Trump asked a foreign government for help to beat me. I’m not surprised the head of the NRA met with Trump to prop him up. I’m not surprised Trump’s special interest friends are spending millions to attack me. And I’m not surprised this President’s allegations of wrongdoing against me have been debunked across the board. I’m not going to let him get away with this. I’m not backing down. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. I’m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I’m going to stay focused on your lives. What we can’t lose sight of in this election is that this election is about you. Your kids. Your family. And you can’t wait when it comes to health care or jobs or education or guns or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I’ll say it again. Like JFK when he spoke about taking America to the moon, I refuse to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. That takes vision , and yes it takes plans , but that’s not enough. It takes the proven ability to get things done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing big, consequential legislation than me. From the ban on assault weapons to the Violence Against Women Act to Obamacare. I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this: a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-in-reno-nevada-d6df0d9f0ac4?source=user_profile---------151----------------------------	EmptySummary					Last week the House of Representatives opened an inquiry into whether the President of the United States has committed impeachable offenses.

MEJB10102019143	Joe Biden	2019-10-10	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Consequences of Donald Trump’s Decision to Remove Troops from Syria	Donald Trump sold out the Syrian Democratic Forces , the courageous Kurds and Arabs who fought with us to smash ISIS’s caliphate , and he betrayed a key local ally in the fight against terrorism. But that’s not all , he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation , raising doubts among our allies around the world about America’s security commitments. And he betrayed our security by green lighting a Turkish incursion that will create chaos and destruction, setting conditions for ISIS to regrow.His sad attempt to excuse the betrayal , saying that the Kurds didn’t fight with us at Normandy 75 years ago in World War II , adds insult to very real injury. By that standard, only Canada, a handful of European allies, and others could ever hope for America to come to their defense , and even they might have doubts after Trump’s performance. Especially when Trump said he wasn’t worried about ISIS regrouping and fleeing Syria because they would only go to Europe.Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan , a fellow strongman who has issued his own threat to send millions of Syrian refugees into Europe if they dared to criticize his attack. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he’s doing.This is not about keeping forces in northern Syria indefinitely. That was never the plan.

But that's not all , he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation , raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments. And he betrayed our security by green lighting a Turkish incursion that will create chaos and destruction, setting conditions for ISIS to regrow.His sad attempt to excuse the betrayal , saying that the Kurds didn't fight with us at Normandy 75 years ago in World War II , adds insult to very real injury. By that standard, only Canada, a handful of European allies, and others could ever hope for America to come to their defense , and even they might have doubts after Trump's performance. Especially when Trump said he wasn't worried about ISIS regrouping and fleeing Syria because they would only go to Europe.Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan , a fellow strongman who has issued his own threat to send millions of Syrian refugees into Europe if they dared to criticize his attack. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing.This is not about keeping forces in northern Syria indefinitely. That was never the plan. It's about consolidating our hard-fought gains against ISIS, and preventing it from regenerating , which it is already trying to do. Managing this complex environment requires smart and sustained diplomacy, which President Trump has demonstrated he has neither the patience nor the wisdom to conduct. Every day, President Trump's incompetent policies make us less safe.
MEJB10102019144	Joe Biden	2019-10-10	Joe Biden’s Remarks in Rochester, New Hampshire	Good afternoon everyone. It’s great to be back in New Hampshire. This is a state built on fierce pride , pride in your independence, pride in your reputation, pride in your character. That has been true from the earliest days of our nation, when “Live Free or Die” wasn’t a motto. It was an imperative for survival sprung from a granite-hard determination that no one would decide the future of the American people , save ourselves. And when those freedom fighters earned our independence and cobbled together a nation capable of self-governance of meeting threats, both foreign and domestic, they knew that the battle for our nation didn’t end at Yorktown. At the time, one of the biggest concerns was that foreign nations would interfere in our affairs. That is why we have the Emoluments clause to prevent presidents from being secretly bribed or paid off by foreign governments. In his farewell address, George Washington specifically warned against foreign nations meddling in our affairs: “Since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.” Over the 200 plus years that have followed, we have been constant in our vigilance to keep foreign nations out of our elections. That is , until Donald Trump. Last week, on the White House lawn, President Trump invited China to help decide our elections. He did it while standing in front of a line of reporters and cameras, in the broad light of day. It was the third foreign power that we know of , that he has asked in clear, unmistakable language , to intervene on his behalf in the democratic proceedings of the United States. “Russia, if you’re listening ” “I would like you to do us a favor though ” to Ukraine’s president. “China should start an investigation.” It’s wrong. It undermines our elections. And it’s un-American. Go into any city or town in this nation. Go into any schoolhouse. Go into any town hall. Go into any VFW hall. Go to any football or baseball game and ask a simple question: Is it ok for a foreign nation to meddle in our elections? To spread lies about an opponent. Particularly at the direct invitation of the sitting President. The answer is no. As Americans, it offends every bone in our body. The ballot box is sacred ground in America. It’s where we make our voice heard. It’s where we decide who leads us. It’s where we chart America’s future. It’s where we fulfill our duty as citizens. It’s not complicated. It’s called democracy. We believe Americans should decide American elections. Period. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic forms of democracy. That is stunning , and dangerous, outrageous , because it directly threatens our democracy. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. No President in American history ever dared engage in such unimaginable behavior. With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself. By obstructing justice and refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry, he has already convicted himself. In full view of the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation, and committed impeachable acts. To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity, he should be impeached. And that is not only because of what he has done. The answer to whether he has committed acts sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious. We see it in Trump’s own words. We see it in the texts from the State Department officials that have been made public. We see it in his pulling much of the United States government into his corrupt scheme. But we must remember that impeachment isn’t only about what a president has done. It is also about the threat a president poses to the nation if allowed to remain in office. One thing about this president is absolutely clear , he sees no limit on his power. He believes the entire United States government can be corrupted into furthering his personal political needs. He is even willing to hold Congressionally-appropriated aid to foreign nations hostage to his personal political demands. He believes if he does something, it’s legal. And perhaps most importantly, he believes there is nothing we can do about it. He believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it. It’s no joke. He is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it. We should have no illusion. This is a president who has decided that this nation doesn’t have the tools or the power or the political will to stop him from doing whatever he wants. Trump isn’t just testing us. He is laughing at us. He has no sense of decency. He doesn’t care about the law. He believes that people , and nations , that follow the rules are suckers, fools, losers. We have to prove him wrong. We have to demonstrate that our constitution, our government, and our elected leaders are up to this moment. And this is an especially dangerous moment for our nation because we know the pressure on Trump is only going to increase. And as that pressure increases, he is only going to grow more volatile, more erratic, more self-serving, more destructive. He will stop at nothing to save himself , no individual, no institution, nothing that we have held sacred in this nation for more than 200 years will be safe. If Donald Trump was still just a reality TV star, it wouldn’t matter. But he’s responsible for the largest economy in the world. He’s the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in history. He’s supposed to be the leader of the free world. Yet, with the free world under threat from advancing authoritarianism, Donald Trump has completely abdicated American global leadership. At a time when China’s abuses of human rights are cause for enormous concern; more than one million Uyghur Muslims imprisoned in horrific so-called “reeducation” camps; in Hong Kong, protestors increasingly being met with violent repression as they demand the democratic rights they were promised , does he speak out for human rights and stand with the people of Hong Kong? No. In fact, he promises to stay silent. Trump and his emissaries have sought , repeatedly , to extort the existential fears , of Ukraine’s leaders for political advantage. Holding up political support and vitally needed military aid to pressure Ukraine at a time when it is engaged in a live war with Russia , a war that has cost thousands of Ukrainian lives. This isn’t a game. This is deadly serious. The United States cannot afford to have a president who will abuse whatever power is available to him to get re-elected. And here’s the kicker: people around the president knew that what he was doing was wrong , profoundly wrong. So they tried to cover it up by hiding the evidence. We only know about all this thanks to the courageous actions of a whistleblower who has since been joined by others stepping up to protect our country. Trump’s scheme has been exposed. Trump did it because like every bully in history, he’s afraid. He’s afraid of just how badly I will beat him next November. He is targeting me and my family with lies and distortions and smears and that is all that they are because he thinks it will undermine my campaign for the presidency. He just keeps lying even though the mainstream media has called him out for his lies. He’s spending tens of millions of special interest dollars to spread those lies. He’s trying to orchestrate a campaign where truth and the facts are irrelevant. His lying is matched only by his manifest incompetence. There is no level to which he will not stoop. He’s insinuated that the people who spoke to the whistleblower should be executed. Here’s what Trump said in a closed door meeting to US diplomats: “I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.” What President has ever used such language? Now the Whistleblower is worried for their safety. Thanks to our president. Trump’s even dared to say that if he is removed from office, it will spark a civil war. Right wing media outlets are full of baseless conspiracy theories. The darkest reaches of the internet are awash in these vile attacks. And he is spending millions on TV to spread his lies. And that is what they are , lies. There is no truth in his charges and attacks against me. None. Zero. Every independent news organization that has reviewed his charges at length found them to be a flat out lie. And Trump knows it. My insistence that a prosecutor who was viewed as corrupt be replaced was the official policy of the United States government, supported by Republican Senators, the European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and our allies , including the UK, France, and Germany. What Trump did in Ukraine was to carry out a secret policy for his own personal political benefit. What I did was to seek to replace a weak prosecutor , with one who would, we hoped, go after the corruption that is holding back Ukraine. What Trump did was hold hostage political support and hundreds of millions in desperately needed aid to a country at war to advance his personal political demands. And now there are reports that not only did Trump send Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, to carry out his scheme and co-opt the State Department , and, as alleged, allies of Giuliani were also working a side deal at the same time to make millions in Ukraine. A corrupt scheme with an additional helping of corruption and self-dealing on the side: Classic Trump. The abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency. He acts, reacts, twists, and turns according to what he thinks is good for him, for his ego, his personal politics, his campaign money. And virtually every day he launches a barrage of tweets to disparage, to insult, to threaten anyone who does not bathe him in praise, who challenges his outrageous behavior , behavior that is beneath a President. Think about the way he tweets and talks about women of color who dare to speak their minds against him , sitting Members of Congress. Think about the way he turned on the FBI and America’s intelligence services , who pointed out Russia and Putin’s attacks on our electoral process. He has repeatedly demonstrated his desire to advance his own personal gain ahead of the public good. And that he will do anything it takes to hold on to power , to protect himself. We need to be clear about something. This isn’t just an academic exercise in political theory. A president who puts his own self-interest ahead of the public good and national security also poses a threat to each and every American in our daily lives. He’s already threatened the Whistleblower , and anyone who talked to the Whistleblower. Now we hear reports of additional Whistleblowers coming forward. Some with information on how he was pressuring Ukraine. Others with respect to pressure he may have put on the IRS about his taxes. And by the way , where are his taxes? What is he hiding? What is he afraid of? What is buried in those returns? Why can’t the American people see them? Why can’t he release them? I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns. Every penny I’ve made is there for the public to see. And Trump? It’s all hidden. Why? Why? He has proven he will use the Justice Department against anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. And now the Justice Department is intervening on Trump’s behalf in his personal lawsuits to hide his finances from the public eye. Trump has proven he will use the State Department against anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. He will order the removal of career diplomats who won’t carry out his whims without question. Does anyone doubt he would use any other part of the government, any other power available to a president, to destroy anyone he believes threatens his power or ability to stay in office. When I announced my candidacy, I said I was running to restore the soul of this nation. That is what is at stake in 2020. That’s why this election is so important. And that’s why we are not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for President. I’m not going to let him get away with this. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name calling. None of these attacks are true. I’m going to stay focused on your lives. That’s what this election is about , you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable peaceful international order. I have said it before and I’ll say it again. Like JFK said, when he spoke about taking America to the moon: “I am unwilling to postpone the work that has to get done. For you. For America. The possibilities are limitless.” That takes vision , and yes it takes plans. But that’s not enough. It takes the proven ability to get it done. There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I have. From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve been there. I know what it takes to get it done. Let me finish with this , a lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump. And I agree. We do have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum. May God Bless America and May God Protect our Troops.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-in-rochester-new-hampshire-3860b4156da6?source=user_profile---------150----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon everyone.

MEJB17102019142	Joe Biden	2019-10-17	Joe Biden’s Remarks in Davenport, Iowa	Of all the roles a president of the United States must fill, none is more consequential than Commander-in-Chief. The power to deploy the might of the most powerful military in the history of the world is not an ego booster or a ratings booster. To take the oath of office is to swear a solemn responsibility to our troops and their families , that their government will not risk their lives pointlessly.To our allies and partners , that we will stand with them in time of need.And to our adversaries , that the United States seeks peace, but will not hesitate to defend our vital national security interests.By this measure , like so many others , Donald Trump is a complete failure. He is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had. He has failed, repeatedly, to foresee the obvious consequences of his impulses. And when the utterly predictable occurs , he seems not to care. Or he blames someone else. The buck never stops with him. Talks with North Korea collapsing because they were based on nothing but a delusional promise from a bloody dictator.An erratic trade war with China that’s caused huge pain , including here in Iowa, where 160 workers in the Quad Cities were recently laid off, indefinitely, at Deere.Real pain for American farmers and manufacturers for virtually no gain, because he has no strategy. Iran growing more provocative and restarting its nuclear program because Trump chose to renege on a diplomatic agreement that was working. And now, Turkish forces invading Syria to attack our Kurdish partners because Trump tweeted our withdrawal. The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform. To building and maintaining the confidence of our allies.By precipitously withdrawing the small number of U.S. forces in Syria, Trump managed in one fell swoop to betray our Kurdish partners who helped defeat ISIS.Create a humanitarian crisis with innocent civilians and ethnic and religious minority communities in the crossfire, and up to 160,000 newly displaced people fleeing their homes.Force our troops into retreat, under fire, as forces from Turkey, Russia, and the Assad regime flow in.Give ISIS a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants and guarding prisons with 10,000 ISIS terrorists and supporters, some of whom have now escaped.And throw global confidence in American leadership into a free fall. These consequences can be laid directly at Donald Trump’s feet. He greenlighted Turkey’s invasion. Now he’s left asking Turkey to stop it. But the damage has been done. You don’t get do-overs when it comes to national security. These decisions are deadly serious. Yes, the dynamics in Syria are incredibly complicated. And yes, the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds dates back decades. But before Trump’s tweet, the small number of U.S. forces, working together with our Kurdish partners, were actually keeping northern Syria relatively stable while keeping the pressure on what was left of ISIS. Now that’s been blown apart. Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside. That’s why we need someone in the Oval Office who understands the gravity and the consequences of their decisions. Trump’s “great and unmatched wisdom” has undone years of hard-won progress across two administrations in a matter of days , including in our fight against ISIS in Syria.And as retired Admiral James Stavridis said, “everyone was absolutely flabbergasted.”Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible. It’s about the only time they’ve mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump. That’s how outrageous it is , even Mitch McConnell knows it’s wrong. Trump tried to justify his decision to abandon our Kurdish partners by making the ridiculous charge that they: “didn’t help us in the Second World War, they didn’t help us with Normandy.” Well, guess what: they helped us smash ISIS, a direct threat to the United States and our friends around the world. Now, that didn’t happen during World War II, but some of it did happen during Trump’s first year in office. You’d think he’d remember. He bragged about it at the time. The Kurds stood with us to accomplish a vital national security objective of the United States , the destruction of ISIS’s territorial caliphate. We achieved this without sending tens of thousands of U.S. forces and without spending a quarter of a trillion dollars, as we did during the Iraq surge.Instead, the Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground. Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump’s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing , until last week. These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice. And then, Trump sold them out. All it took was one phone call with the President of Turkey. So now, instead of being a reliable American partner helping maintain stability and keeping a lid on terrorism , the Kurds have taken the only option available to them to avoid being wiped out by the onslaught of the Turkish military. They’ve made a deal with twin devils , with Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin , to hand control of the northeast of Syria back to the brutal, Russian- and Iranian-backed regime. How does this keep America safe? How does this advance our interests in the world? The answer is simple. It doesn’t. You know who does benefit, though , America’s adversaries.Russia, which will be now be able to further expand its influence throughout Syria.Russia again, which gets to sit back and watch one NATO ally impose sanctions on another, furthering Putin’s ultimate goal of fracturing our Alliance. Iran and Hezbollah, which will now be more emboldened to use Syrian territory to launch attacks against Israel.ISIS, which is already seeking to regroup, and now has hundreds of supporters released back into the region.And every single strongman, autocrat, and dictator around the world who has just learned that President Trump will abandon our partners under the smallest amount of pressure.All we’re left with is a Donald Trump-shaped hole in America’s credibility , and more chaos, more instability, more threats to the American people, our partners, and our allies in the region.And don’t be fooled by Trump’s argument that he’s pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East and ending forever wars. He may have caved to Erdogan and Putin, forcing our troops to retreat under fire, but he’s also authorized the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia to deal with a yet another crisis that he helped create , the one with Iran.But this time, without our allies. So don’t believe Trump’s con. This is not American leadership , this is bending to the will of strongmen. And this is not an end to forever wars , it is a recipe for more wars. He still has more than a year in office , God forbid he has four more after that. Imagine what damage he could do in that time , either intentionally or through sheer incompetence. We cannot let that happen. I will not let that happen.The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy, salvaging our reputation, and rebuilding confidence in the commitments made by the United States around the world. They will have to address the world as it is in January 2021 , in whatever state of disarray Trump leaves it.And there won’t be time to lose building relationships from scratch. We need a leader who can, on day one, pick up the phone to call our NATO allies and there won’t be any question of whether or not the United States will meet our treaty obligations or stand up for democracy and freedom. I’ve personally met and built relationships with almost every world leader. I’ve negotiated with President Erdogan. I know how he operates. In fact, the reason that the United States partnered with Kurdish militias in Syria in the first place is because Turkey dragged its heels on helping us fight ISIS. I spent hours , literally , going over proposals with Erdogan. He wanted to leverage our concern over ISIS to get the United States to essentially go to war against the Syrian government , which neither our Administration, nor the American people wanted. So, unlike President Trump , I told Erdogan “no.” But we kept working with Turkey, helping them cope with millions of Syrian refugees , designated as much humanitarian aid as we could to alleviate as much suffering as possible, while also welcoming those fleeing violence to our shores. And we put in place the successful strategy with the Kurds that ultimately brought down ISIS, while preventing Turkey and the Kurds from coming to blows. We shouldn’t fool ourselves , there may never be a solution in Syria that satisfies our best hope for a region at peace with itself. No one wants American troops to be forever embroiled in conflict in the Middle East or “nation-building.”But there’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely , which I oppose and will end , and using small numbers of special operators to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. We can be strong and smart at the same time. And when we do draw down, there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. And what Trump has done in Syria is disastrously wrong. So as this Trump-created crisis devolves further into chaos , what should we be doing? First, we should be working closely with NATO and the UN to bring more responsible parties to the table. The United States and Turkey are allies , even if Turkey is not acting like one , so we should be inviting in a broader coalition of countries to pressure Turkey to pull back from its operation, refrain from ethnic cleansing or targeting religious minorities, and cease its callous disregard for civilians. The international community should make it clear that we intend to investigate any reports of war crimes or violations of international humanitarian law, and to hold accountable those who are responsible. Second, we should actively work to mediate a resolution between Turkey and the Kurds to end the violence.The United States should be willing to set up and facilitate those talks and engage all sides. Leading the free world requires us to show up. To put skin in the game. We shouldn’t be delegating this to Putin. Third, we have an obligation to provide critical humanitarian support to mitigate the new refugee crisis unfolding before our eyes. The Trump administration has released $50 million in humanitarian aid to Syria , but that’s only a quarter of the $200 million in aid to Syria it suspended last year.And how will it be distributed when frontline humanitarian groups have suspended services and pulled their staff out of areas where there’s fighting? We should be willing to carry out airlifts of food, water, and critical first aid supplies to meet the need. Fourth, we must remain laser-focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS. As the Kurds withdraw to defend their villages from Turkish attack, it is easy to imagine ISIS re-growing and filling the void. We cannot let that happen.Because no matter how much Donald Trump tweets that it will be easy for the Europeans to recapture escaped ISIS fighters, or for us to “go back & BLAST” ISIS , that’s not how it works. That’s not how it worked the first time, and it certainly won’t be how it works if we have to fight ISIS again. During our Administration , we built a global coalition to take on ISIS that eventually grew to 81 partners. Nations and organizations from all around the world stood with us, because the word of the United States was trusted under the Obama-Biden administration. So ask yourself , after everything that Trump has done, after every international treaty that Trump has pulled out of, after every Ally that Trump has attacked, after leaving a partner to be slaughtered with no discernable strategy who would stand with us today? And if they don’t stand with us, how many more of our brave sons and daughters will have to carry the fight alone in the future? And that brings me to the final point I want to make today. What President Trump is doing is bigger than Syria. It’s more insidious than the betrayal of our brave Kurdish partners. It’s more dangerous than taking our boot off ISIS’s neck. Donald Trump is demolishing the moral authority of the United States. His incompetence is so extreme and his abuse of power is so rampant , that he is torching America’s influence and our ability to get things done. Climate change, mass migrations, unfair trade practices, disruptive technologies, nuclear proliferation, an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia , how will we meet any of the real global challenges we face, if the United States is forever reduced in the eyes of the world to an unreliable partner? Diplomacy isn’t just a series of handshakes and photo ops. It’s relationships that you are constantly building and maintaining. Working to identify the areas of common interest while managing points of conflict. It requires discipline. It requires a team of experienced professionals that you empower , not diminish and demoralize. And it requires a coherent national security process to get everyone on the same page and to execute. After almost three years as president, Trump still doesn’t understand any of this. And he never will. Because the only thing Donald Trump cares about is himself. Not our allies. Not our obligations. Not our diplomats. Not our values. Not our leadership. Not our standing in the world. Not the incredible human suffering caused by his decisions. Not even the likelihood that ISIS will regenerate and once more gain strength to threaten our country. There’s so much at stake in this election , issues that matter to every single American family , and one of them is this: What does America stand for in the world? Who do we want to be? The United States builds alliances and works with our partner democracies , for the sake of our own national security and economic prosperity. No country, even one as powerful as ours, can go it alone against challenges that respect no borders and cannot be contained by walls. The investments we make in others come back to us ten-fold , in markets for our products, partners to help us tackle global challenges, and allies to deter aggression or fight alongside us when deterrence fails. If we’re out of the picture, make no mistake , nations will make accommodations to work with those who are, whether that’s Russia or China or any other country. And the world will move on without us. Donald Trump’s vision is antithetical to everything generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to defend. I believe we are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. I believe we can and must still be the nation to which the world looks. That mobilizes others for the common good. The beacon of liberty, offering refuge to the oppressed. The bulwark of democracy and self-determination. The champion of human rights. The leader of the free world. All of that is on the ballot. So we have to choose. We have to choose the America we want to be. We have to choose if we want to retake our place in the world, to keep the United States safe and secure. We have to choose a president who will rebuild our credibility and restore the value of America’s word. Thank you, and may God protect our troops.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-in-davenport-iowa-80fbc8405c2c?source=user_profile---------148----------------------------	EmptySummary					Of all the roles a president of the United States must fill, none is more consequential than Commander-in-Chief. The power to deploy the might of the most powerful military in the history of the world is not an ego booster or a ratings booster. To take the oath of office is to swear a solemn responsibility to our troops and their families , that their government will not risk their lives pointlessly.To our allies and partners , that we will stand with them in time of need.And to our adversaries , that the United States seeks peace, but will not hesitate to defend our vital national security interests.By this measure , like so many others , Donald Trump is a complete failure. He is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we've ever had. He has failed, repeatedly, to foresee the obvious consequences of his impulses. And when the utterly predictable occurs , he seems not to care. Or he blames someone else. The buck never stops with him. Talks with North Korea collapsing because they were based on nothing but a delusional promise from a bloody dictator.An erratic trade war with China that's caused huge pain , including here in Iowa, where 160 workers in the Quad Cities were recently laid off, indefinitely, at Deere.Real pain for American farmers and manufacturers for virtually no gain, because he has no strategy. Iran growing more provocative and restarting its nuclear program because Trump chose to renege on a diplomatic agreement that was working. And now, Turkish forces invading Syria to attack our Kurdish partners because Trump tweeted our withdrawal. The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform. To building and maintaining the confidence of our allies.By precipitously withdrawing the small number of U.S. forces in Syria, Trump managed in one fell swoop to betray our Kurdish partners who helped defeat ISIS.Create a humanitarian crisis with innocent civilians and ethnic and religious minority communities in the crossfire, and up to 160,000 newly displaced people fleeing their homes.Force our troops into retreat, under fire, as forces from Turkey, Russia, and the Assad regime flow in.Give ISIS a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants and guarding prisons with 10,000 ISIS terrorists and supporters, some of whom have now escaped.And throw global confidence in American leadership into a free fall. These consequences can be laid directly at Donald Trump's feet. He greenlighted Turkey's invasion. Now he's left asking Turkey to stop it. But the damage has been done. You don't get do-overs when it comes to national security. These decisions are deadly serious. Yes, the dynamics in Syria are incredibly complicated. And yes, the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds dates back decades. But before Trump's tweet, the small number of U.S. forces, working together with our Kurdish partners, were actually keeping northern Syria relatively stable while keeping the pressure on what was left of ISIS. Now that's been blown apart. Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside. That's why we need someone in the Oval Office who understands the gravity and the consequences of their decisions. Trump's 'great and unmatched wisdom' has undone years of hard-won progress across two administrations in a matter of days , including in our fight against ISIS in Syria.And as retired Admiral James Stavridis said, 'everyone was absolutely flabbergasted.'Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible. It's about the only time they've mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump. That's how outrageous it is , even Mitch McConnell knows it's wrong. Trump tried to justify his decision to abandon our Kurdish partners by making the ridiculous charge that they: 'didn't help us in the Second World War, they didn't help us with Normandy.' Well, guess what: they helped us smash ISIS, a direct threat to the United States and our friends around the world. Now, that didn't happen during World War II, but some of it did happen during Trump's first year in office. You'd think he'd remember. He bragged about it at the time. The Kurds stood with us to accomplish a vital national security objective of the United States , the destruction of ISIS's territorial caliphate. We achieved this without sending tens of thousands of U.S. forces and without spending a quarter of a trillion dollars, as we did during the Iraq surge.Instead, the Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground. Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump's secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing , until last week. These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice. And then, Trump sold them out. All it took was one phone call with the President of Turkey. So now, instead of being a reliable American partner helping maintain stability and keeping a lid on terrorism , the Kurds have taken the only option available to them to avoid being wiped out by the onslaught of the Turkish military. They've made a deal with twin devils , with Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin , to hand control of the northeast of Syria back to the brutal, Russian- and Iranian-backed regime. How does this keep America safe? How does this advance our interests in the world? The answer is simple. It doesn't. You know who does benefit, though , America's adversaries.Russia, which will be now be able to further expand its influence throughout Syria.Russia again, which gets to sit back and watch one NATO ally impose sanctions on another, furthering Putin's ultimate goal of fracturing our Alliance. Iran and Hezbollah, which will now be more emboldened to use Syrian territory to launch attacks against Israel.ISIS, which is already seeking to regroup, and now has hundreds of supporters released back into the region.And every single strongman, autocrat, and dictator around the world who has just learned that President Trump will abandon our partners under the smallest amount of pressure.All we're left with is a Donald Trump-shaped hole in America's credibility , and more chaos, more instability, more threats to the American people, our partners, and our allies in the region.And don't be fooled by Trump's argument that he's pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East and ending forever wars. He may have caved to Erdogan and Putin, forcing our troops to retreat under fire, but he's also authorized the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia to deal with a yet another crisis that he helped create , the one with Iran.But this time, without our allies.

MEJB28102019140	Joe Biden	2019-10-28	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump’s Lack of Strategy to Secure our Nation Against Terrorist Threats	The successful operation to take Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi off the battlefield was a win for American national security. And it’s an important reminder of the skill and commitment of our military, intelligence, and national security professionals. They are beyond compare.I’m glad President Trump ordered the mission. But as more details of the raid emerge, it’s clear that this victory was not due to Donald Trump’s leadership. It happened despite his ineptitude as Commander-in-Chief.It’s been reported that Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw our troops from northern Syria forced the planning for the mission to be accelerated and the timeline compressed. His erratic behavior made it harder and more dangerous for the special forces carrying it out. And they had to fly through territory that is now hostile to the U.S., taking fire along the way , including territory we controlled just weeks ago.Trump has also made it less likely we will be able to successfully replicate a mission like this in the future. The operation leveraged a limited presence of U.S. counterterrorism capabilities in the region, which he keeps trying to dismantle. It was made possible by the work of intelligence professionals, who he has relentlessly attacked. It relied on allies he has belittled, undermined, and in some cases betrayed and abandoned.Trump’s total disregard for our alliances and partnerships endanger any future intelligence sharing or cooperation. In fact, the first people he saw fit to thank after our brave troops were the Russians and the Iranian-backed Syrian government. All this makes us less safe and less prepared for whatever terrorist leader emerges next.And make no mistake, the threat is not gone. One man does not constitute an organization, and Trump has opened a path for ISIS to reconstitute itself under new leadership by withdrawing troops from the region. In doing so, he has given up our best asset to keep the pressure on ISIS during a dangerous period of organizational chaos. His fixation on keeping troops in the region to defend the oil fields betrays his true priorities , profit seeking , and will surely serve as a tool for future terrorist recruitment. And with his decision to slash humanitarian assistance to the region, it’s more likely that ISIS will be able to insinuate itself back into areas where we had successfully rooted it out.There is a difference between deploying hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to the Middle East indefinitely, and keeping small numbers of special operations and intelligence assets in place to maintain local partnerships and keep pressure on terrorists. That’s the smart, strong, and sustainable strategy we pioneered during the Obama-Biden Administration.

MEJB1112019139	Joe Biden	2019-11-01	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Donald Trump’s Repeated Diplomatic Failures	This morning, North Korea fired two missiles in a deliberate attempt to provoke its neighbors and intimidate the United States , again. It was the 12th such test the regime has conducted since May in violation of UN resolutions, and which President Trump has down-played. After the latest round of denuclearization talks collapsed almost immediately in Stockholm earlier this month, these tests are a stark reminder that Donald Trump , a self-proclaimed deal maker , has achieved nothing but a string of spectacular diplomatic failures that are making the American people less safe.His “love letters” to murderous dictator Kim Jong Un have delivered little more than made-for-TV moments. North Korea today has more fissile material and more capability than when talks began, and Trump has given away our leverage , including suspending military exercises with our allies and granting Kim co-equal status at two summits with the president of the United States of America , for practically nothing in return. Now a more confident Kim is ticking up the pace of his violations because he believes he can pressure Trump to bend to his will. There is no deal, because there is no strategy and no patience for the kind of tough, hard diplomacy that actually produces results.It’s a pattern we see over and over again. Donald Trump talks a big game, promises the greatest deal ever, then gives away America’s best negotiating tools in exchange for a photo op for himself. He only cares about his own self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment. And every single time, it’s the American people who end up paying.He pulled us out of the successful Iran nuclear deal, promising he’d get a better one. He hasn’t. And now, Iran has taken its nuclear program out of the deep-freeze and ramped up its aggressive acts across the region , and Trump has no strategy to deal with these predictable responses.He pulled us out of the Paris climate accord and dismisses climate change as a hoax. In less than a week, we will officially notify our departure from Paris, even as California is on fire and states throughout the Midwest are still recovering from record flooding over the summer.He scuttled negotiations with the Taliban that might have opened the door to a peace settlement, reportedly because he didn’t get the Camp David moment of glory he wanted. Meanwhile he’s significantly weakened our negotiating position by imposing a possibly politically-motivated timeline for removing our troops from Afghanistan, without extracting any concessions from the Taliban in return.His vaunted Middle East peace deal has yet to emerge. He gave away our strongest asset to take on ISIS by precipitously withdrawing our troops from Northeast Syria. He promised to get tough with China, saying trade wars were “good and easy to win.” But at more than a year in, what do we have to show for it? Nothing but pain for American farming and manufacturing, and vague promises that would only restore trade levels with China back to where they were before Trump’s irresponsible trade war.The American people can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump’s art of no deals.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-donald-trumps-repeated-diplomatic-failures-2e8bc4a84e84?source=user_profile---------145----------------------------	EmptySummary					This morning, North Korea fired two missiles in a deliberate attempt to provoke its neighbors and intimidate the United States , again.

He only cares about his own self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment. And every single time, it's the American people who end up paying.He pulled us out of the successful Iran nuclear deal, promising he'd get a better one. He hasn't. And now, Iran has taken its nuclear program out of the deep-freeze and ramped up its aggressive acts across the region , and Trump has no strategy to deal with these predictable responses.He pulled us out of the Paris climate accord and dismisses climate change as a hoax. In less than a week, we will officially notify our departure from Paris, even as California is on fire and states throughout the Midwest are still recovering from record flooding over the summer.He scuttled negotiations with the Taliban that might have opened the door to a peace settlement, reportedly because he didn't get the Camp David moment of glory he wanted. Meanwhile he's significantly weakened our negotiating position by imposing a possibly politically-motivated timeline for removing our troops from Afghanistan, without extracting any concessions from the Taliban in return.His vaunted Middle East peace deal has yet to emerge. He gave away our strongest asset to take on ISIS by precipitously withdrawing our troops from Northeast Syria. He promised to get tough with China, saying trade wars were 'good and easy to win.' But at more than a year in, what do we have to show for it? Nothing but pain for American farming and manufacturing, and vague promises that would only restore trade levels with China back to where they were before Trump's irresponsible trade war.The American people can't afford four more years of Donald Trump's art of no deals.
MEJB6112019138	Joe Biden	2019-11-06	I Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career	The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny.I have fought for the Democratic party my whole career. I know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it’s not just policies or issues. It’s in my bones. That’s not something everyone in this primary can say.But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn’t agree with you , it’s not just that you disagree , that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.Some call it the “my way or the highway” approach to politics. But it’s worse than that. It’s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.It’s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: “We know best; you know nothing”. “If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.”This is no way to get anything done. This is no way to bring the country together. This is no way for this party to beat Donald Trump.There are a lot of ways , a lot of progressive ways , to fix our health care system and to make our tax system fair and to address the challenge of climate change. I believe I have proposed the most progressive, transformational ideas in this campaign , and I can get them done.My health care plan expands coverage, lowers costs, lowers drug costs, allows people to keep their private insurance and won’t raise taxes on the middle class. I think it’s the best plan. That doesn’t mean I think those who disagree with me are cowards or small thinkers. And it doesn’t mean someone else doesn’t have some good ideas. I just think it’s a better way.My tax plan will require the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, eliminate the most egregious tax loopholes and change our tax structure to reward work and not just wealth. I think it’s the best plan. That doesn’t mean those who disagree with me are corrupt or cowards. And it doesn’t mean others don’t have good ideas. I just think I have a better way.I learned a long time ago that if you question someone’s motivations rather than their judgment you get nowhere. It’s hard to get past go if you start off by saying the other person is in the pocket of special interests or is corrupt. To get anything big done in this country, we need to persuade, to compromise, to reach consensus. That’s the way a democracy works.But since some have questioned whether I’m running in the wrong primary , let me answer that question.I’m running in the Democratic primary as a proud Democrat.I stand with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama , the party that fought for and passed the Affordable Care Act , an historic transformation of our health care system that took a generation to achieve. And I’m proud to say I was there when we passed it. I’m not walking away from ObamaCare , I want to build on it. Maybe others want to walk away from ObamaCare , I don’t. And I don’t believe the Democratic party should walk away from it either. I make no apologies for that.I stand with the Democratic Party of Nancy Pelosi. Nancy is an historic figure , she will be remembered as one of the great Speakers in the history of this nation. She knows what it took to win back the majority in the House of Representatives. And she doesn’t want to put that majority at risk. She knows what it takes to get big things done. Nancy Pelosi believes we should build on the Affordable Care Act. There has never been a Speaker who was tougher, smarter, or had a bigger vision for this country than Nancy Pelosi.So , let’s stop these kinds of attacks. Let’s keep our eye on the ball. Above all else, we must defeat Donald Trump.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/i-have-fought-for-the-democratic-party-my-whole-career-2ca4a2dac271?source=user_profile---------144----------------------------	EmptySummary					The other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary.

MEJB10112019137	Joe Biden	2019-11-10	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the 30th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall	Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. The fall of the wall symbolized the spirit of democracy sweeping across communist Europe, whose people peacefully rose up and claimed their freedom. Today, it’s clear the democratic project of 1989 is unfinished, and the longstanding goal of a Europe “whole, free, and at peace” remains unfulfilled. Authoritarianism is again on the rise, and aspiring autocrats are advancing so-called “illiberal democracy,” which is no more than an assault on the rule of law, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary. President Trump has recklessly and foolishly relinquished America’s role as the most powerful champion of democratic principles. He has damaged our reputation around the world by his actions here at home , defending those who promote hatred and violence, calling the media the “enemy of the people,” and undermining the integrity of our public institutions. Abroad, he sides with autocrats and dictators, emboldens corruption, and defends those who murder journalists and dissidents. And, like the authoritarians of a half century ago, Trump has misplaced his faith in a wall instead of the power of the human spirit. Trump’s flawed vision of what America stands for undermines our core values as Americans. Now, when the world’s democracies should be looking to America for leadership, and when millions who still live under oppression look to us for hope and support , Donald Trump seems to be on the other side. As President, I will make revitalizing democracy a signature priority for my administration. In my first year in office, I will host a global Summit for Democracy to renew the same spirit and shared purpose that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Our ability to defend democracy abroad depends, above all, on the strength of our democracy at home. It enables us to lead with the power of our example, not just the example of our power. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. Democracy’s triumph over communism proved that our freedoms are the bedrock of our society and the wellspring of our power. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy and the leader of the free world. The stakes are simply too high.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall-e24260143594?source=user_profile---------143----------------------------	EmptySummary					Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship.

MEJB11112019136	Joe Biden	2019-11-11	Statement from Dr. Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden on Veterans Day	John Steinbeck memorably wrote that, “A soldier is the most holy of all humans, because [they are] the most tested.” From Fort McHenry to San Juan Hill, from the Argonne Forest to Midway, from the Mekong Delta to Fallujah, and on every battlefield between, America’s veterans have always been the most tested among us , and they have never failed in their duty. In each generation, a small fraction of Americans serve and sacrifice on behalf of us all. Less than one percent of our population risks everything to protect our country, incurring in the rest of us a debt far greater than our nation could ever repay. We have always believed that the most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war , to care for them and their families, both while they are deployed and after they come home. It’s an obligation we are honor-bound to keep. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. Every one of our veterans deserves timely, world-class health care , the very best of what our country has to offer. They deserve comprehensive mental health support, and a thoughtful, well-funded plan to address the ongoing tragedy of veteran suicides. They deserve a serious approach to ending veteran homelessness, and greater resources to help them readjust to life at home once their service concludes. Not only do they deserve these things , their families and caregivers do, too. Our veterans also deserve a leg up when it comes to educational and economic opportunities , everything from tuition assistance to skills training to entrepreneurship programs. That isn’t just for their benefit; America benefits enormously from the leadership, talent, and experience of veterans who gird every sector of our economy with sinew and smarts. The GI Bill was one of the greatest engines of widespread prosperity our country has ever conceived, helping to cement the most resilient middle class in the history of the world in the wake of World War II. Our veterans and our country deserve that commitment to be upheld and advanced. Most of all, our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us. That’s why, on this Veterans Day, we are proud to release a detailed and comprehensive plan to honor the full breadth of our obligation to veterans and their families , and to restore the sacred commitments that this White House has seen fit to ignore. This plan and this cause are personal to us. Over the course of many years, it has been our honor to visit our troops in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to witness their incredible strength of character firsthand. We have been blessed to visit with wounded veterans in Landstuhl, Germany, and at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, and to welcome troops to our home for Thanksgiving dinners and spend many Christmas Days with the heroes at Walter Reed. When our son Beau was deployed to Iraq for a year, we whispered prayers, and learned a small portion of what sacrifice means to the families of those who serve. Every one of the more than 18 million veterans in our country has earned our admiration and our gratitude , but it is our duty to repay them with something more than that. We must honor their service with bold policies that meet our sacred obligation, with opportunities commensurate to the sacrifices they and their families have made, and with trustworthy national leadership.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-dr-jill-biden-and-vice-president-joe-biden-on-veterans-day-c3b4062744b4?source=user_profile---------142----------------------------	EmptySummary					John Steinbeck memorably wrote that, 'A soldier is the most holy of all humans, because [they are] the most tested.'

That includes DREAMers, young people who came to the United States as children.After saying that he would treat DREAMers with “heart,” President Trump adopted a heartless policy to end DACA , leaving hundreds of thousands of law-abiding people who had placed their trust in the promises of their government caught in fear, confusion, and uncertainty. DREAMers are Americans in every way that matters. We are better than this.What President Trump will never understand is that DACA not only gave hundreds of thousands of young people a chance at a better, more secure life, but that those DREAMers also gave back to our communities and our country ten-fold. I’m just as proud to stand with the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who have contributed to and strengthened our country today as I was when President Obama and I made DACA a reality.

MEJB25112019134	Joe Biden	2019-11-25	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women	The scourge of violence against women and girls affects every community around the world: an estimated one in three women are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives, with closer to 70% of women affected in some countries. Violence against women takes many forms, including sexual violence and rape, early and forced marriage, damaging practices like female genital mutilation and cutting, and street harassment. Violence against women tears families apart, stymies economic growth and development, and obstructs post-conflict reconciliation.Yet on this critical issue, like so many others, President Trump has abandoned American global leadership and reduced America’s moral authority in the world by actively working against progress. He threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution aimed at curbing sexual violence in conflict if it promised survivors access to the critical services they need to heal and recover. He has suspended funding to the UN Population Fund, which does important work to prevent gender-based violence globally. And his administration has attempted to rewrite the rules for asylum seekers, turning its back on women and children refugees fleeing gender-based violence. It’s disgraceful, and it’s beneath us as a nation.Today marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Women’s rights activists selected this date to honor the Mirabal sisters, three political activists killed on November 25, 1960, for standing up to a murderous regime in the Dominican Republic. Nearly 60 years later, women around the world from the frontlines of protest movements in Lebanon and Sudan to political chambers across Europe and the United States who raise their voices and call for change continue to face harassment and violence. Some, like Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf, who was brutally murdered in northern Syria last month, continue to pay the ultimate price for their activism. These attacks are intended to silence them and to intimidate other women , it’s on all of us to ensure violence is not the cost of women gaining power and rights.Today, I join leaders and activists around the world to say violence against women must end. I have made this issue a priority throughout my career. As a Senator, I wrote and championed the Violence Against Women Act, landmark legislation that helped change the culture around domestic violence in the United States by making sure it would be treated as a crime, not a private matter, and by dedicating resources to support survivors. The Violence Against Women Act has had significant effect: between its implementation in 1994 and 2011, rates of serious victimization by an intimate partner dropped by 72 percent.This legacy has given the United States greater credibility to address gender-based violence on the international stage. In 2007, I introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a comprehensive approach to addressing gender-based violence globally. When Congress failed to act, the Obama-Biden administration used executive action to implement the core principles of the bill.But there is still more work to do at home and abroad, which is why, earlier this month, I issued the Biden Plan to End Violence Against Women. As president, I will expand the services available to all survivors , including those in marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected , and ensure justice is within their reach. My Administration will confront the online harassment and abuse that now is a too-frequent reality for women and young people around the world. We will address the deadly combination of gun violence and domestic violence in the United States. We will also do more to protect and empower immigrant women who are survivors of domestic violence and abuse, and to welcome women who come to the United States fleeing abuse, whose home governments cannot or will not protect them.Around the world, we must all stand up and speak out against gender-based violence. As president, I will restore U.S. leadership in foreign affairs, including by returning to a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls. I will champion the fundamental human right of all women and girls to live free from violence , a future made more possible in the United States through the Violence Against Women Act. I am committed to building on the Obama-Biden legacy with new, comprehensive policies to address gender-based violence, including by supporting multilateral efforts to address sexual violence in conflict and holding perpetrators accountable. And I will immediately reverse the devastating global gag rule, which has hurt the health and wellbeing of countless women around the world.Today, as we honor the legacy of the Mirabal sisters and rally around the cause of ending violence against women and girls, it is important to recognize the many women around the world working to make their communities safer for everyone. As president, I will elevate these women’s voices and ensure that the United States supports them, in the hopes that we will one day we will succeed in changing the culture and ending violence against women.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-international-day-for-the-elimination-of-violence-18c124f589c1?source=user_profile---------140----------------------------	EmptySummary					The scourge of violence against women and girls affects every community around the world: an estimated one in three women are subjected to physical violence, rape or stalking by a partner at some point in their lives, with closer to 70% of women affected in some countries.

MEJB1122019133	Joe Biden	2019-12-01	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on World AIDS Day	Today, Jill and I join communities around the world in marking World AIDS Day , a time to remember the millions of souls lost to this scourge and rededicate ourselves to realizing a future free of HIV/AIDS.Ending HIV/AIDS will take all of us working together, “community by community.” Nonprofits, businesses, and governments, faith-based groups and activists, we all have a role to play in mobilizing action and maintaining our momentum on this critical issue. According to UNAIDS, approximately 24.5 million people are on lifesaving antiretroviral therapy. Yet, with about 1.7 million new infections in 2018 alone, and HIV continuing to ravage certain marginalized populations, particularly women and young girls across sub-Saharan Africa, our work is far from over.To start, we must end the spread of HIV/AIDS in the United States. This includes robust support for programs in communities with inadequate health services; fighting health disparities and inequalities in communities of color; expanding effective prevention programs; sufficiently funding the opioid epidemic response; and modernizing criminal laws that fuel stigma and create disproportionate penalties for people living with HIV.This is also a global crisis. In 2008, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I led the re-authorization of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). At that time, achieving the kind of progress we have seen was almost unimaginable. PEPFAR is one of the most impactful initiatives the United States has ever created, a shining example of American foreign assistance at its very best. The program has allowed more than 2.6 million babies with HIV-infected mothers to be born free of the disease. Together with the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and community partnerships in this fight, more than 32 million lives have been saved from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Every life saved is a victory, and with scientific progress and new advances in the treatment, prevention, and management of HIV/AIDS, it is within our reach to eventually rid the planet of this epidemic. Evidence shows that medications that suppress the virus to undetectable levels can prevent transmission of HIV, and that expanded prevention programs can dramatically reduce new infections. Despite making a commitment to end HIV/AIDS in the next decade, President Trump has proposed draconian cuts to domestic and international programs and undermined the Affordable Care Act, which are critical to achieving our goals. Furthermore, his efforts to allow health care providers to discriminate and deny services to LGBTQ patients may jeopardize prevention efforts in high-burden and high-risk communities, including transgender populations, who are five times as likely to be diagnosed with HIV.We need to support evidence-based policies to fight discrimination, support women’s reproductive rights, ensure universal education for girls and boys, and defend the human rights of LGBTQ people around the world, which are all critical to finishing the work we started.Going forward, we must strategically integrate our HIV/AIDS programs into a broader health and development agenda; work with countries to strengthen their health care systems to manage HIV and other health challenges; and expand our global health security efforts to rally other nations to join us in ending tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics. These increased investments in global health are in America’s direct interest not only because they reduce the likelihood that deadly diseases spread unchecked, they strengthen global economic security.Over the last 30 years, the fight against HIV has taught us to be big-hearted; to follow the science; to treat everyone with dignity and respect; and to protect the human rights of all who walk this planet. With the compassion of people around the world and the dedication of communities on the front lines of this response, our shared dream of an AIDS-free future can become a reality.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-world-aids-day-5a718a5ab22c?source=user_profile---------139----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, Jill and I join communities around the world in marking World AIDS Day , a time to remember the millions of souls lost to this scourge and rededicate ourselves to realizing a future free of HIV/AIDS.Ending HIV/AIDS will take all of us working together, 'community by community.'

MEJB10122019131	Joe Biden	2019-12-10	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Human Rights Day	Jill and I join communities across the United States and around the world in marking Human Rights Day , an opportunity to affirm our fundamental belief in the rights, freedoms, and dignity of all people.Seventy-one years ago, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Then, as now, the notion that every individual is created equal and enjoys fundamental human rights was a contested idea. Yet thanks to the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, who chaired the drafting committee, the United States helped rally the world behind a common understanding of our shared humanity, one rooted in our own founding documents.Today, that basic truth , that fundamental idea at the foundation of free societies everywhere , is under vicious assault. It is under threat by a resurgence of illiberalism, nationalism, and authoritarianism. It is in peril from Donald Trump and demagogues around the world who are leaning into these forces for their own personal and political gain.Globally, we are witnessing an assault on vulnerable communities, including through Islamophobia, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism. A million or more Uighurs languish in detention camps in China and many Rohingya live in abject conditions in Bangladesh, while peaceful demonstrators in Iraq and Iran come under fire from their own government’s armed forces. Protesters from Algeria to Venezuela are showing their frustration with socio-economic and political systems that fail to protect universal human rights and allow them to live with dignity.The Trump administration is too often silent in the face of this tide of tyranny, while President Trump himself warmly embraces some of the world’s most odious dictators.As we confront these challenges, we must recognize that American leadership on human rights must begin at home , in the way that we treat our neighbors and those most vulnerable among us. While the Trump administration has trampled our core values here and abroad, our long history of championing liberty and justice will not be denied.As president, I will take decisive steps to demonstrate that America is prepared to lead again , not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example. We will recommit ourselves to building a world based on fairness and opportunity for all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender identity, nationality or sexual orientation. We will rebuild American diplomatic capacity to support and defend human rights around the globe, including through international institutions. We will rejoin the UN Human Rights Council and work to ensure that body truly lives up to its values.

MEJB12122019130	Joe Biden	2019-12-12	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on the Anniversary of the Paris Climate Accord	Today marks the fourth anniversary of the day the world gaveled in the Paris Agreement on climate change , the most ambitious, inclusive climate agreement in history. It was an extraordinary moment. The Paris Agreement marked the start of a global, coordinated effort to tackle the most formidable threat of our time. We knew the job wasn’t finished, but the world finally agreed to move down the right path , together. President Trump’s reckless decision to unilaterally withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite the indisputable scientific evidence. It again confirms that he is incapable of real leadership. While Trump complains that other countries aren’t doing enough on climate, he walked away. That’s a dangerous approach to a challenge that requires urgent, sweeping action. It puts America at risk. It puts the world at risk.As President, I’ll rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office and begin implementing policies to ensure the United States achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050. I will convene a climate summit with leaders of the major emitting nations within the first 100 days of my Administration and bring to bear the full force of our diplomacy, our economy, and our technical expertise to get every country to increase the ambition of their commitments under the Paris Agreement. And I’ll invest $1.7 trillion to make sure the United States leads the clean-energy market of the future.The Paris Agreement was only possible thanks to years of tough, clear-eyed diplomacy. Of the nearly 200 countries that have signed the agreement, none have followed Trump out the door. But without the United States driving urgency and accountability, we’ve begun to see backsliding and slowing progress. The Paris Agreement is a framework for action , not a once-and-done solution. Its success demands continued diplomacy, mutual accountability, and pressure on all countries to transition to a low-carbon economy as quickly as possible. Its success will require the leadership of the United States. The United States accounts for 15 percent of global emissions. That means we can’t address climate change alone, but it also means the world can’t address it without us. It has been deeply encouraging to see our governors, mayors, youth leaders, business leaders, civil society leaders, and others ramp up their action to fill the vacuum of leadership left by Trump. They’re making a real difference and their work will be essential in the years ahead. But as long as Trump sits in the Oval Office, we cannot make the progress our planet needs.It’s time to put an end to President Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-anniversary-of-the-paris-climate-accord-c8328db863bd?source=user_profile---------136----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today marks the fourth anniversary of the day the world gaveled in the Paris Agreement on climate change , the most ambitious, inclusive climate agreement in history.

MEJB14122019129	Joe Biden	2019-12-14	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden Marking Seven Years Since the Sandy Hook Shooting	Seven years ago this morning, 26 families in Newtown, Connecticut, said goodbye to their loved ones for the last time. Twenty little first graders, excited to sing holiday songs and make gingerbread houses, were shot dead in their classrooms, along with six educators who tried to protect them. Families were shattered on the spot, and the nation’s heart was broken. It was a tragedy that will forever be embedded in who we are as a nation, even as we still struggle to fathom the depth of such a loss.Many of us resolved then that the moment would be a watershed for America , that the senseless loss of those beautiful children, in a place that was supposed to be their second sanctuary, would finally pierce the gridlock to defeat the National Rifle Association and the gun manufacturers, and to once-and-for-all transform our gun laws so that this could never happen again.In those first days after Newtown, President Obama asked me to lead a task force that met with 229 different groups. We submitted a sweeping plan to change our gun laws and make our children and communities safer. We announced 23 executive actions to strengthen the gun background check system, restart public health research on gun violence, help schools establish emergency management plans, and more. We also put forward legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales, but the Senate defeated that bill in April 2013.Since then, thousands more people have been hit in hundreds more shootings at schools , from Marysville, Washington, to Santa Fe, Texas, to Parkland, Florida , and in other mass shootings and daily acts of gun violence that may not make national headlines, but are just as devastating to the families affected.I had no illusions in 2013 about what we were up against, and I have no illusions today. The gun lobby has done and will continue to do everything in its power to stop us. Today, it has Trump and the Republican leadership in its pocket.I said when I got into this race that I’m running to restore the soul of America. Few things make the need for that more clear than school shootings , what kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs?I know that we can defeat the NRA. I’m the only candidate in the race who has done it before , twice, when I was in the Senate.As president, I’ll do it again. I’ll repeal the federal law that protects gun manufacturers from civil liability claims, finally forcing them to face up to the lives they’ve destroyed , a fight that so many courageous Sandy Hook parents are now waging. I’ll ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require background checks for all gun sales, incentivize states to enact red flag laws to get guns out of dangerous hands, and more. And, if Leader McConnell continues to block common sense gun safety reforms in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 , like closing the boyfriend and stalker loopholes , I will make enactment of those steps a priority in my first 100 days.There’s a reason why I remain so optimistic that we will ultimately defeat the NRA. Its best efforts and all its gun-manufacturer money haven’t been able to squelch the momentum for change that Sandy Hook set loose. There’s a straight line from the brave parents of Newtown, many of whom have organized at the grassroots level and in the courts, to the activism of the Parkland students, to the millions of others who’ve said “enough” in the long years between and since then. This call for change is growing louder and louder, and is using every tool of our democracy, in the streets, voting booths, and courts.Read Joe Biden’s full plan to end gun violence at joebiden.com/gunsafety.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-marking-seven-years-since-the-sandy-hook-shooting-f0948b613b02?source=user_profile---------135----------------------------	EmptySummary					Seven years ago this morning, 26 families in Newtown, Connecticut, said goodbye to their loved ones for the last time.

MEJB18122019128	Joe Biden	2019-12-18	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on the Rise of Anti-Semitism and the Battle for the Soul of This Nation	Across America, and around the globe, the disturbing rise of anti-Semitism is shredding the fabric of our communities, tearing apart the lives of innocent people and their families, and eroding the soul of our nation.This tide of hatred fueled last week’s horrific act of domestic terrorism that took the lives of a police officer and three people at JC Kosher Supermarket in New Jersey. It’s the same hatred that unleashed the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history last year at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. That led a gunman armed with an AR-15 style gun to storm the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in California earlier this year on the last day of Passover.We have to fight the pernicious and persistent evil of anti-Semitism at every level of our society , starting with our political leaders. My dear friend, the late Tom Lantos, had a saying that I’ve quoted frequently. He said, “The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.” That means we have to stand up and speak out every time anti-Semitism rears its head, because silence can all too quickly become complicity.Yet, after Charlottesville, instead of condemning a naked display of hatred, Trump assigned a moral equivalence between those streaming through the night with torches, chanting anti-Semitic bile , and the courageous neighbors and activists who stood against them. He gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.We have all seen what has followed. There’s a short line from those white supremacists in Charlottesville chanting “Jews will not replace us,” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year, saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”Since he took office, Trump has presided over a historic increase in hate crimes and biased-incidents targeting people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ Americans, and people of Jewish faith. Active hate groups grew to 1,020 in the U.S. last year, with white nationalists leaping almost 50%, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. FBI data shows that most of our religion-based hate crimes are aimed at Jews. At the end of 2017, Trump’s first year in office, anti-Semitic incidents increased nearly 60%, the largest one-year increase since the Anti-Defamation League started keeping records 40 years ago.As I said after Charlottesville, we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And, it’s why I am running for president.Trump announced his first campaign by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists.” He called a major American city a “disgusting rat-and rodent-infested mess” that “no human being” would choose to live in. He tried to ban a whole religion from entering our country. He has repeated anti-Semitic tropes and sought to turn U.S. support for Israel into a political football. In both clear language and cynical code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy and anti-Semitism in this nation. The Jewish people know better than anyone, that any action designed to marginalize one ethnic or religious group imperils us all.Trump’s actions have only worsened the crisis: retweeting white nationalist postings. Cutting funding for Obama-Biden initiatives put in place to counter violent domestic extremism.As I said earlier this year, we must enact a federal domestic terrorism law. We have to make the same commitment to rooting out domestic terrorism as we’ve made to stopping it internationally. And, we can do it without infringing on people’s free speech and without trampling civil liberties.We must appoint leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice who will prioritize the prosecution of hate crimes , making clear that there is no place for such vitriol in this country.We must defeat the National Rifle Association to get weapons of war off our streets and out of dangerous hands. I know we can because I’ve done it before , twice. As president, I’ll do it again. I’ll ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require background checks for all gun sales, and close the hate crime loophole by enacting legislation to get guns out of dangerous hands of those convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime.And, we have to condemn pernicious stereotypes wherever we find them, and stand up to those who seek to delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations. No nation, including Israel, is immune from legitimate criticism, but it should not be unfairly singled out.Hate didn’t begin with Donald Trump, and it won’t end with him. But this is a defining moment in our nation’s history. A moment where we are once again called to fight against the same forces of hate and intolerance that we’ve battled throughout our history. Yet it’s in these times, when what’s at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.I am running for president because I believe in the best of America. I believe in our values of equality, giving everyone a fair shot, and treating everyone with dignity and respect. We are a country that gives to hate no safe harbor.

It's the same hatred that unleashed the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history last year at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. That led a gunman armed with an AR-15 style gun to storm the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in California earlier this year on the last day of Passover.We have to fight the pernicious and persistent evil of anti-Semitism at every level of our society , starting with our political leaders. My dear friend, the late Tom Lantos, had a saying that I've quoted frequently. He said, 'The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.' That means we have to stand up and speak out every time anti-Semitism rears its head, because silence can all too quickly become complicity.Yet, after Charlottesville, instead of condemning a naked display of hatred, Trump assigned a moral equivalence between those streaming through the night with torches, chanting anti-Semitic bile , and the courageous neighbors and activists who stood against them. He gave license and safe harbor to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the K.We have all seen what has followed. There's a short line from those white supremacists in Charlottesville chanting 'Jews will not replace us,' to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year, saying Jews 'were committing genocide to his people.'Since he took office, Trump has presided over a historic increase in hate crimes and biased-incidents targeting people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ Americans, and people of Jewish faith. Active hate groups grew to 1,020 in the U.S. last year, with white nationalists leaping almost 50%, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. FBI data shows that most of our religion-based hate crimes are aimed at Jews. At the end of 2017, Trump's first year in office, anti-Semitic incidents increased nearly 60%, the largest one-year increase since the Anti-Defamation League started keeping records 40 years ago.As I said after Charlottesville, we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And, it's why I am running for president.Trump announced his first campaign by calling Mexican immigrants 'rapists.' He called a major American city a 'disgusting rat-and rodent-infested mess' that 'no human being' would choose to live in. He tried to ban a whole religion from entering our country. He has repeated anti-Semitic tropes and sought to turn U.S. support for Israel into a political football. In both clear language and cynical code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy and anti-Semitism in this nation. The Jewish people know better than anyone, that any action designed to marginalize one ethnic or religious group imperils us all.Trump's actions have only worsened the crisis: retweeting white nationalist postings. Cutting funding for Obama-Biden initiatives put in place to counter violent domestic extremism.As I said earlier this year, we must enact a federal domestic terrorism law. We have to make the same commitment to rooting out domestic terrorism as we've made to stopping it internationally. And, we can do it without infringing on people's free speech and without trampling civil liberties.We must appoint leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice who will prioritize the prosecution of hate crimes , making clear that there is no place for such vitriol in this country.We must defeat the National Rifle Association to get weapons of war off our streets and out of dangerous hands. I know we can because I've done it before , twice. As president, I'll do it again. I'll ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require background checks for all gun sales, and close the hate crime loophole by enacting legislation to get guns out of dangerous hands of those convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime.And, we have to condemn pernicious stereotypes wherever we find them, and stand up to those who seek to delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations. No nation, including Israel, is immune from legitimate criticism, but it should not be unfairly singled out.Hate didn't begin with Donald Trump, and it won't end with him. But this is a defining moment in our nation's history. A moment where we are once again called to fight against the same forces of hate and intolerance that we've battled throughout our history. Yet it's in these times, when what's at stake matters the most, that we decide who we are, and maybe more importantly, who we want to be.I am running for president because I believe in the best of America. I believe in our values of equality, giving everyone a fair shot, and treating everyone with dignity and respect. We are a country that gives to hate no safe harbor. We lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. So let us renew our commitment to our better angels and do what this president cannot: Stand together against hate, and stand up for what, at our best, this nation believes.Read Joe Biden's full plan to end gun violence at
MEJB712020126	Joe Biden	2020-01-07	Joe Biden’s Remarks on the Unfolding Situation with Iran	Six months ago, here in New York City, I made the case that Donald Trump was “dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.” In the past few days, in the wake of the killing of Iranian General Soleimani, Donald Trump has proven it beyond dispute. The haphazard decision-making process that led up to it, the failure to consult our allies or Congress, and the reckless disregard for the consequences that would surely follow , was dangerously incompetent.In the wake of such an enormous escalation that has exploded geo-politics in the region and put the United States and Iran on a collision course, what would we expect of an American President , and what have we heard from President Trump? We have not heard a sober-minded explanation to reassure the American people about his decision and its consequences. Not level-headed words meant to dial down tensions and take us off the path of conflict.No press conference or consultation with Congress. No , all we have heard from this president is tweets. Threats. Tantrums. And all we have heard from his administration are shifting explanations, evasive answers, and repeated assertions of an imminent threat, without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion. And since this is a president with a history of lying about everything , who has destroyed his own credibility, and that of the United States on the global stage , neither the American people, nor our allies, are inclined to take his word for it. If there was an imminent threat that required extraordinary action, then we are owed that explanation , and the facts to back it up. These are matters of deadly import, so let me be unmistakably clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to go to war with Iran without Congressional authorization. Working with Congress is not an optional part of the job. Presidential notification to Congress about the need to exercise war powers cannot be satisfied in 280 characters or less. And no president should ever take the United States to war without securing the informed consent of the American people. So , because he refuses to level with the American people about the danger in which he has placed American troops and our diplomatic personnel and civilians, as well as our partners and allies, or to demonstrate even a modicum of presidential gravitas , I will. That starts with an honest accounting of how we got here. Make no mistake: this outcome of strategic setbacks, heightened threats, chants of “death to America” once more echoing across the Middle East, Iran and its allies vowing revenge. This was avoidable.The seeds of these dangers were planted by Donald Trump himself on May 8, 2018 , the day he tore up the Iran nuclear deal, against the advice of his own top national security advisors. The day he turned his back on our closest European allies, and decided it was more important to him to destroy any progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration than build on it to create a better, safer world. When we had the Iran Deal, we had verifiably cut off every one of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon. International inspectors repeatedly confirmed Iran’s compliance, as did our intelligence agencies. One of the greatest threats to stability in the region and global security was off the table. And when the Iran Deal was in force, we did not have this dangerous cycle of tit-for-tat provocation and response. There was a united front of allies and partners to address Iran’s other destabilizing actions throughout the region. The Iran Deal was not only accomplishing the critical mission it was designed for, it created an environment where diplomacy was possible. But Trump walked away , not Iran. Trump made the United States the international outlier. Trump re-imposed significant sanctions designed to exert “maximum pressure” on the regime, with claims that it would deter Iranian aggression and return Iran to the negotiating table to secure a much-promised “better deal.” And on both fronts, as many anticipated at the time, Trump’s promises were empty, baseless, and naïve. And since then, all that has materialized is an utterly predictable cycle of escalating conflict with Iran. Of course Iran would seek to demonstrate that the pressure we were exerting was not cost free , that it could take actions to make life more difficult for us, as well. So Iran began again to enrich uranium beyond the limits allowed under the Iran deal. Iran attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran shot down an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone.Yet the administration had no plan to prevent, mitigate, or appropriately respond to these provocations. Instead, Trump acted erratically and impulsively. He ordered a retaliatory strike, then called it off at the last minute , feeding Iran’s sense of impunity.Then, the administration imposed more sanctions, shot down an Iranian drone, issued a warrant to seize an Iranian oil tanker.Before long, Iran attacked Saudi oil facilities and Iranian-backed militia in Iraq restarted rocket attacks against our bases. Until one of those attacks, against our base in Kirkuk, killed a U.S. citizen and wounded others. It was a tragic loss of life, and an act condemned by all Americans.In response, Trump bombed five sites in Iraq and Syria tied to the militia group, killing at least 25. Iraqi protestors, organized by Iranian-backed militia, assaulted our Embassy in Baghdad and breached the outer wall. No injuries were reported, but Trump was embarrassed by the images of a burnt-out reception area. He ordered a drone strike to kill Soleimani , perhaps the second most important official in Iran , near the Baghdad airport. And rushed thousands more troops to the region to deal with the fallout.Action and reaction. Provocation and response. All predictable , and, indeed, all predicted. A president who says he wants to end endless war in the Middle East is bringing us dangerously close to starting a new one. A president who says he wants out of the region sends more than 18,000 additional troops to deal with a crisis of his own making. And an administration that claims its actions have made Americans safer in the same breath urges our citizens to leave Iraq and puts Americans throughout the region on notice because of the increased danger. I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They’ve ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them , and a self-defeating way. Trump’s approach is demonstrably the latter. Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops and thousands of innocent lives throughout the region. He was the mastermind, but he was not the whole of the regime or its capacity to strike back. So the question is: was the reward of removing a bad actor worth the risk of what comes next?We don’t have any evidence to suggest that Trump or anyone around him thought seriously about that calculus. It’s been reported that the Pentagon , which has long warned against taking a shot like this , was shocked that Trump would take such a risk. This is not just a question of whether Iran will retaliate , it almost certainly will , but what it will mean for our troops and our personnel throughout the region. What it will mean for our allies and partners who also have troops in harm’s way that are impacted by this decision. What it will mean for our long-term mission to counter Iran and prevent ISIS from bouncing back, and our ability to pursue our broader strategic aims in the region. Already, we are seeing the fall out. Iran has declared it will no longer abide by any of the constraints set up under the nuclear deal , putting it back on track to obtaining material for a nuclear weapon, and pushing the region closer to a nuclear crisis. Our forces in Iraq and Syria are now focused on protecting themselves and preparing to leave , putting the counter-ISIS mission on hold, and allowing a deadly terrorist organization the room to regroup and reactivate. The Iraqi parliament has voted to eject all American and coalition forces from the country. And however you may feel about an American military presence in the Middle East, there is a right way and a wrong way to draw down our troop presence. Getting unceremoniously kicked out is unequivocally the wrong way. And if we do end up having to leave, that would be another boon to Iran , tipping the balance of power in the region. Where, just weeks ago, there were spontaneous protests across Iran against the regime, the killing of Soleimani has taken that pressure off the regime. Trump’s impulsive decision may well do more to strengthen Iran’s position in the region, than any of Soleimani’s plots could have ever accomplished. Whether or not we see more loss of life, more threats against American interests and assets , this is already a debacle. And at what is possibly the most dangerous time in recent American history , at precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats , Donald Trump’s short-sighted “America First” dogmatism has come home to roost. Our closest allies are calling for restraint and de-escalation , on both sides. Making a moral equivalence between us and Iran. Russia and China are quietly reveling in the prospect that the United States may once more be bogged down in another major conflict in the Middle East. They would love nothing more than to be able to pursue their own interests, and carve out their own spheres of influence, without the United States challenging them on human rights, on abusive trade practices, or on meddling in other nations’ democracies , because we are too busy fighting Iran. We are alone. And we alone will have to bear the costs of Donald Trump’s folly. This is also the moment when we most feel the lack of a functioning national security process or any investment in diplomacy.After three years of hollowing out the State Department; disrespecting and dismissing our intelligence community; destroying the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill; throwing out the deliberate policy making process that has served Republican and Democratic administrations for decades; corroding the value of the word of the United States; abusing our allies; embracing dictators; creating, not solving, foreign policy crises on the international stage , we are in a much worse position to meet the demands of this crisis than we were when President Obama and I left office. President Trump has no strategy here. No endgame. And here’s the hardest truth of all: His constant mistakes and poor decision making have left us with a severely limited slate of options for how to move forward , and most of the options are bad. But there are some key steps that any responsible commander in chief would take. And, while I don’t expect Donald Trump will listen to me, I hope he listens to those around him who understand the gravity of the threats we now face. He should take all necessary steps to protect our forces and ensure the security of our diplomats, civilians, and overseas facilities , not just in the Middle East, but anywhere that Iran might strike back. He should ensure that federal authorities are working with states, local governments, and private institutions to guard against the heightened risk of cyber attacks. He should stop tweeting so he doesn’t box us in with his threats, such that the only options left to us or Iran are increasingly damaging strikes and counterstrikes. And he should immediately reach out to our European partners and others to send private signals of deterrence and de-escalation to Iran and find a way to avoid the onrush of war. The best way to do that, of course, would be for President Trump, to rejoin the Iran Deal and build on it , if Iran also moves back into compliance with its obligations , and re-establish international consensus about how to confront the threats from Iran. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy , clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that’s not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship. Diplomacy that is designed to de-escalate the crisis, protect our people, and secure our regional interests , including our counter-ISIS campaign. No one wants war. But it’s going to take hard work to make sure we don’t end up there by accident. Finally, and this one’s not optional, Mr. President, you have to explain your decisions and your strategy to the American people. That is your job as President , Not Dear Leader, not Supreme Leader. Democracy runs on accountability. And nowhere is that more important than in the power to make war and bring peace. You are required to work with Congress. You are required to abide by the War Powers Resolution. You cannot pursue a war with Iran absent Congressional authority. The existing AUMFs , the Congressional Authorizations for the Use of Military Force , do not apply. The American people do not want, and our Constitution will not abide, a president who rules by fiat and demands obedience. I served in the executive branch of our government for eight years, but I served in the legislative branch for 36 prior to that, and I understand better than anyone that the system will not hold unless we find ways to work together to advance our national interests , not the political interests of one person or one party. We need to restore the balance of powers between the branches of government. We need checks and balances that actually serve to check and balance the worst impulses of our leaders , in any branch. We need to use our system to bring us together as a nation , not abuse it to rip us apart. That’s not a naïve or outdated way of thinking. That’s the genius and timelessness of our democratic system, which has, for more than 240 years, allowed us to remake ourselves, reckon with our shortcomings, and move ever forward. That’s what we owe to those brave men and women who step forward to wear the uniform of these United States; who dedicate their lives to diplomatic service; who choose to join the Peace Corps or to work in development; who represent the best of our country all around the world , and who are, today, doing so at greater risk because of the actions of our president. Thank you , and in these dangerous times , may God protect our troops.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-on-the-unfolding-situation-with-iran-2505cc1a280b?source=user_profile---------132----------------------------	EmptySummary					Six months ago, here in New York City, I made the case that Donald Trump was 'dangerously incompetent and incapable of world leadership.'

MEJB222020125	Joe Biden	2020-02-02	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Donald Trump’s Expanded Travel Ban	Yesterday, Donald Trump further diminished the United States in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban, placing new restrictions on the residents of six more nations that limit who is allowed to come to the United States.Three years ago, he took aim at Muslim-majority nations. This time, he targeted primarily African nations , including Nigeria, the largest economy and the most populous nation on the continent, and Sudan, a country striving to transition to civilian rule after decades of dictatorship. The “Muslim Ban,” this new “African Ban,” Trump’s atrocious asylum and refugee policies , they are all designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s that simple. They are racist. They are xenophobic.And there is no evidence that they do anything to make us safer. If anything, they endanger the best tools we have to fight terrorism , our globe-spanning network of alliances and partnerships. They erode our moral standing in the world and make it less likely that other nations will work with us to take on terrorist threats before they can reach our shores.Immigrants from each of these countries and their broader diaspora communities here in the United States enrich the larger fabric of American life as our friends and neighbors and make vital contributions to our economy. They make our nation stronger. The United States has a meaningful history of offering safety and opportunity to peoples of every nation , no matter where they come from, no matter if they are rich or poor, no matter the faith they follow.Donald Trump is doing everything in his power to destroy that legacy. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-donald-trumps-expanded-travel-ban-17ac0ee039b9?source=user_profile---------131----------------------------	EmptySummary					Yesterday, Donald Trump further diminished the United States in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban, placing new restrictions on the residents of six more nations that limit who is allowed to come to the United States.Three years ago, he took aim at Muslim-majority nations.

It's that simple. They are racist. They are xenophobic.And there is no evidence that they do anything to make us safer. If anything, they endanger the best tools we have to fight terrorism , our globe-spanning network of alliances and partnerships. They erode our moral standing in the world and make it less likely that other nations will work with us to take on terrorist threats before they can reach our shores.Immigrants from each of these countries and their broader diaspora communities here in the United States enrich the larger fabric of American life as our friends and neighbors and make vital contributions to our economy. They make our nation stronger. The United States has a meaningful history of offering safety and opportunity to peoples of every nation , no matter where they come from, no matter if they are rich or poor, no matter the faith they follow.Donald Trump is doing everything in his power to destroy that legacy. It's a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed.
MEJB1422020124	Joe Biden	2020-02-14	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden Two Years After the Mass Shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School	Two years ago, 17 innocent people were gunned down and 17 more injured by a shooter with an AR-15 style weapon at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Just over four months earlier in Las Vegas, 58 concert goers were slaughtered and hundreds more were injured in minutes by a shooter with an arsenal that included AR-15s modified with bump stocks.We have a problem with guns in this country, and the reason we do not act is simple: cowardice. Political cowardice from the very people who should be fighting the hardest to protect us but instead are picking the side of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association.Every day in America, an average of 100 people die because of a gun. Some of their names make national headlines, others do not. Each one is a life ripped from a family and community; each a future of unknowable potential snuffed out. And, every day that we do nothing in response, it is an insult to the innumerable lives across this nation that have been forever shattered by gun violence.I have fought for sensible gun safety laws for decades and will do so every day as president. I have stood up to the gun lobby and the NRA, and I have beaten them , twice. It wasn’t easy, but because we did it before, I know we can do it again. Despite the fierce lobbying efforts of the NRA, we got the Brady Bill passed, creating the background check system that today has kept three million guns out of dangerous hands. Now we need to require background checks for every single gun sale, including at gun shows and online. We got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned for 10 years in this country. We need to do it again and institute a buy-back program to get AR-15s and other weapons of war out of our communities. And, we need to undo one of the biggest concessions to special interests ever made in Washington , the immunity that today protects gun manufacturers from being held accountable in courts for the carnage inflicted with their products.Since the tragedy in Parkland, student activists and bereaved parents like Fred Guttenberg have joined other survivors of gun violence and family members of victims to turn their tragedy into purpose, in the hope that no other family will have to endure what they have suffered. It’s time we had a president in the White House who will have their backs.That’s the kind of leadership we owe to all those we have lost, and to the lives we can still save.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-two-years-after-the-mass-shooting-at-marjory-stoneman-3501ab84221e?source=user_profile---------130----------------------------	EmptySummary					Two years ago, 17 innocent people were gunned down and 17 more injured by a shooter with an AR-15 style weapon at a high school in Parkland, Florida.

MEJB2022020123	Joe Biden	2020-02-20	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Las Vegas, Nevada	Good morning. Thank you for coming out this beautiful Las Vegas morning.The sun is shining. People are going about their days. At work. At school.The voters of Nevada are gearing up to make their choice for the caucus this Saturday.And by the end of the day, approximately 100 more people across the United States will be dead because of a gun.Because of crime. Because of an accident. Because of a self-inflicted wound. Because of a stray shot. Because of intimate partner violence. Because of indiscriminate mass shootings.Because of guns.Another normal day in America.But for Congressman Horsford, who at just 19-years-old lost his father because of a gun, and for all the family members here with me, and people all across the country , normal is a living nightmare.October 1, 2017 was a normal day in Las Vegas until one man, in possession of a small arsenal of assault weapons, many modified with bump stocks to increase the speed of firing, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, opened fire on a crowd of people.In just about 10 minutes, 58 innocents were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. The largest mass shooting in U.S. history.Normal is unacceptable.Moms like Stephanie do not accept a world where her bright, beautiful 4-year-old daughter is cut down by a stray bullet in front of her twin brother, and nothing changes.I do not accept a world where we cannot stand up and say “no more” to the voices that offer empty words in the aftermath of tragedy, then oppose change and fuel this cycle of carnage.I’ve beaten the National Rifle Association , twice , to pass meaningful gun safety legislation at the federal level. And I’ll do it again.I’m incredibly proud of helping lead the fight to pass the Brady Bill, which created our system of background checks and kept more than 3 million guns out of the hands of dangerous people.Now we need to follow the leadership and courage that Nevada’s Democratic legislature and Governor Sisolak have shown by instituting universal background checks , requiring background checks for every gun sale.This is a common sense proposal that has the support of nearly 90 percent of Americans.We can get it done nationally. It just takes a little bit of backbone.Working with Dianne Feinstein, I got assault weapons and high-capacity magazines banned in this country for 10 years. We passed it despite pressure from the NRA. Because no one needs a weapon like the AR-15 , something designed for no other purpose than to kill as quickly and brutally as possible.Every day that we do nothing about the epidemic of assault weapons and high capacity magazines on our streets, it is an insult to the innumerable lives across this nation that have been forever shattered by gun violence.As president, I will get these weapons of war out of our communities.And, it’s past time to correct one of the most egregious special-interest giveaways ever to pass the U.S. Congress , the civil liability protections granted to gun manufacturer,against being sued by the victims of gun violence.Do you realize that three times as many people have been killed by guns in the United States of America as every single soldier killed in war, from Vietnam to today? 150,000 Americans have died in gun murders since 2005 , and that’s not counting suicides.We don’t grant that kind of immunity to any other major industry.Not the tobacco industry. Not the pharmaceutical industry. Just gun manufacturers.It’s immoral.And I think it’s one of the worst votes Senator Sanders has ever taken.You should be able to walk into a court of law and demand that gun manufacturers,with their enormous profits, be held accountable for the carnage that is inflicted with their products.We’re going to repeal that protection when I am president.In fact, on my first day in office, I’m going to send a bill to Congress repealing liability protections for gun manufacturers and closing the background check loopholes that let too many people slip through the cracks.I stand with all the people here today.We care about saving kids.We care about not having an entire generation of children absolutely scarred because they’re afraid of being shot at school.We care about keeping guns away from abusers.We care about young boys and girls getting home safely after playing in their neighborhoods.We care about fewer people, fewer of our veterans, dying by suicide with a gun.I know well the pain of losing a loved one to indiscriminate chance.A terrible car crash took the lives of my first wife and baby daughter. It’s a tragedy many people across the country have experienced. But no one thought we couldn’t make changes that could help prevent people from being killed in car accidents.We passed seat belt laws, required airbags, we continue to make cars safer, we require licenses to drive and for cars to be registered and insured.A terrible cancer took the life of my son Beau, but no one in their right mind thinks it’s not worth fighting for a cure to give the next patient a chance at survival.Why are guns different?The answer is simple: cowardice.Our politicians and elected leaders are just too afraid of the NRA and the gun manufacturers to stand up and do what is right.Not me.I’ve looked in the eye parents who have lost their children to gun violence.I’ve looked in the eye brave young people who have survived school shootings.And I made each of them a promise. It’s the same promise I make to all of you today and to families hurting all across this nation.I will never give up this fight. I won’t stop until we beat the NRA.And if you stand with me, we will pass laws to ban killer assault weapons and hold the gun makers liable.Thank you.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-las-vegas-nevada-57fec1b18b73?source=user_profile---------129----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good morning.

MEJB832020121	Joe Biden	2020-03-08	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on International Women’s Day	On this International Women’s Day, in 2020, it’s a hard truth that we have not yet reached gender equality in our society. In the same year that we commemorate 100 years of women’s suffrage in the United States and honor the incredible courage and accomplishments of all those who fought and suffered for the vote, too many women in our country remain disenfranchised and disadvantaged. Four years after more than 65 million Americans proudly cast their ballot hoping to elect our first female president, we are fighting for the very soul of our nation and to rid the White House of a man who has fostered misogyny, bigotry, racism, and division all across our country. There is no question that women are held to different, often higher standards. They often do more and receive less , less pay, less credit, less encouragement. Harassment, intimidation, threats, violence, and the abuse of power are still pervasive. It shouldn’t still be this way, and I promise that, as president, I will use every tool available to me and take every opportunity to push our nation closer to that aspirational American creed , that all of us are equal in rights and dignity, and deserve equal opportunity. I will promote and prioritize the voices of women, including women of color, in my administration, just as I do in my campaign. Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women, and the United States must practice what it preaches. My White House and Cabinet will look like America. I have pledged to seek gender parity and full diversity in my national security appointments, and that will be true across my government. We have ample evidence of just how hard it is to break down the entrenched barriers that hold back too many women , but we have an obligation to try with all the strength we have in our hearts. That’s what I will do. And we’ll reclaim America’s leadership to defend and advance women’s rights around the world. Today, on International Women’s Day, we must recommit ourselves to doing better for women everywhere, not just here in the United States. Women are underrepresented in positions of power in most countries around the world. We lose trillions of dollars each year from the global economy because women are excluded from full participation in the economy. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime; that number is even higher for women with disabilities, indigenous women, and LGBTQ+ women. Globally, 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; 1 in 5 girls are likely to marry before she turns 18. These statistics are bad for women, and they’re bad for all of us. Yet, instead of continuing the progress that President Obama and I led during our Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Trump’s decision to reinstate and expand the global gag rule has had devastating effects on the health and well-being of women around the world, with fewer organizations providing critical healthcare; and his implementation of this rule here in the United States has cut funds to over 900 women’s health clinics that primarily serve women of color. Trump Administration policies have sought to cut funds for global efforts to improve child and maternal health and to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. His Administration’s cruel immigration policies have rejected asylum claims for women fleeing horrific gender-based violence and made it much more difficult for foreign women and girls who were trafficked into the United States to obtain visas and receive the medical and social services they need to recover. He has watered down and threatened to veto UN Security Council resolutions that address sexual violence in conflict, making it far more difficult for the international community to hold the perpetrators of such violence accountable and ensure survivors have access to the health and support services they need. As president, I will reverse these setbacks and go further to empower women at home and around the world. I will restore America’s role as a champion for women and girls, revitalize our leadership at the United Nations and on the world stage to unlock the potential of half the world’s population, and renew life-saving investments in women’s health. I will ensure that all U.S. efforts amplify the voices of women leaders around the world, who represent some of the most powerful efforts to confront gender inequality and empower women in their societies. If we are to realize the dream of gender equality, we cannot be disheartened or disengaged. Instead we must recommit to fighting for progress, for our own sake and for the sake of all peoples. That starts by making sure Donald Trump is not reelected.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-international-womens-day-926e1db81c45?source=user_profile---------127----------------------------	EmptySummary					On this International Women's Day, in 2020, it's a hard truth that we have not yet reached gender equality in our society.

MEJB1232020120	Joe Biden	2020-03-12	"Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden
on Combating Coronavirus (COVID-19)"	My fellow Americans: Today, across the nation, many of us are feeling anxious about the rapid spread of COVID-19, known as the coronavirus, and the threat it poses to our health, our loved ones, and our livelihoods. I know people are worried, and my thoughts are with all those who are directly fighting this virus , those infected, families that have suffered a loss, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others. And I’d like to thank those who are already making sacrifices to protect us , whether that’s self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses. Because whether or not you are infected, or know someone who is infected, or have been in contact with an infected person , this will require a national response. Not just from our elected leaders or our public health officials , from all of us. We all must follow the guidance of health officials and take appropriate precautions , to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease. It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings. That is why earlier this week, on the recommendation of officials, my campaign cancelled the election night rally we had planned to hold in Cleveland, Ohio. We will also be re-imagining the format for the large-crowd events we had planned in Chicago and Miami in the coming days. And we will continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward, and find new ways to share our message with the public, while putting the health and safety of the American people first. Yesterday, we announced a Public Health Advisory Committee of experts who will counsel our campaign and help guide our decisions on steps to minimize the risk. We will be led by the science. The World Health Organization has now officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation will only hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia. Labeling COVID-19 a “foreign virus” does not displace accountability for the mismanagement that we have seen from the Trump Administration. Let me be crystal clear: the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans and Democrats alike. It will not discriminate based on national origin,race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. A wall will not stop it. Banning all travel from Europe, or any other part of the world, may slow it , but as we have seen , it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics , rather than risk , will be counterproductive. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet. And we need a plan about how we are going to aggressively manage it here at home. The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will face this with the same spirit that has guided us through previous crises. We will come together as a nation. We will look out for one another and do our part as citizens. We have to harness the ingenuity of our scientists and the resourcefulness of our people. And we have to lead the world to drive a coordinated global strategy, not shut ourselves off from it. Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president , and unfortunately, this virus has laid bare the severe shortcomingsof the current Administration. Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth. Our government’s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing-out of our agencies and the disparagement of science. And our ability to drive a global response is dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world. We have to get to work immediately to dig ourselves out of this hole. That is why, today, I am releasing a plan to combat and overcome the coronavirus. The full details are on JoeBiden.com laying out the immediate steps we must take to deliver: A decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need; and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief to American workers, families, and small businesses , and protects the economy as a whole. I offer it as a roadmap, not for what I will do as president 10 months from now, but for the leadership I believe is required right now, in this moment. President Trump is welcome to adopt it today. The core principle is simple: public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions and communicating with the American people. It would be a step toward reclaiming public trust and confidence in the United States government and toward stopping the fear and chaos that can overtake communities faster than this pandemic. And it’s critical to mounting an effective national response that will save lives, protect our front-line health workers, and slow the spread of this virus. First, anyone who needs to be tested based on medical guidelines, should be tested , at no charge. The Administration’s failure on testing is colossal. It is a failure of planning, leadership, and execution. The White House should measure and report each day how many tests were ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands. We should make sure every person in a nursing home, a senior center, or a vulnerable population has easy access to a test. We should establish hundreds of mobile testing sites , at least 10 per state , and drive-thru testing centers to speed testing and protect health care workers. The CDC, private labs, universities, and manufacturers should be working in lock-step to get this done, and get it done right. No effort should be spared. No excuses should be made. Tests should be available to all who need them and the government should stop at nothing to make that happen. We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it, and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hopes of protecting political interests or the stock market. The markets will respond to strong, steady, capable leadership that addresses the root of the problem, not efforts to cover it up. Second, we need to surge our capability to both prevent and treat the coronavirus, and prepare our hospitals to deal with an influx of those needing care. This means not just getting out the testing kits and processing them quickly, but making sure communities have the hospital beds, the staff, the medical supplies, and the personal protective equipment necessary to treat patients. The president should order FEMA to prepare the capacity with local authorities to establish temporary hospitals with hundreds of beds on short notice. The Department of Defense should prepare for the potential deployment of its resources to provide medical facility capacity and logistical support. A week from now, a month from now, we could need an instant, 500-bed hospital to isolate and treat patients in any city in the country. We can do that , but we aren’t ready yet, and the clock is ticking.As we take these steps, state, federal, and local authorities need to ensure that there is accurate, up-to-date information easily available to every American so everyone can make an informed decision about when to get tested, when to self-quarantine, and when to seek medical treatment. And the federal government should provide states and municipalities with clear guidance about when to trigger more aggressive mitigation policies, such as closing schools. Third, we need to accelerate the development of treatments and a vaccine. Science takes time. It will still be many months before we have a vaccine that can be proven safe for public use and produced in sufficient quantity to make a difference. Therapeutics can and should come sooner. That will save lives. We passed the Cures Act in 2016 to accelerate work at the National Institutes of Health, but now it must have every available resource to speed the process along. We must fast-track clinical trials within the NIH, while closely coordinating with the Food and Drug Administration on trial approvals, so that the science is not hindered by the bureaucracy. And, when we do have a vaccine ready to go, it should also be made widely available, free of charge. We should also immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense –with a full-time, dedicated coordinator to oversee the response. Our Administration created that office to better respond to future global health threats after the Ebola crisis in 2014. It was designed for exactly this scenario. President Trump eliminated the office two years ago. Here’s the bottom line: we have to do what is necessary to beat this challenge sooner rather than later. I assure you, if we wait for it to worsen then scramble to catch up, the human and economic toll will be far greater and last far longer. Congress gave the Administration $8 billion last week to fight the virus. We need to know exactly where that money is going, how quickly it is going out the door, and how it is being spent.This brings me to the second half of this challenge , the economic dislocation the coronavirus will cause in our country. We must do whatever it takes, spend whatever it takes, to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy. Taking immediate, bold measures to help Americans who are hurting economically right now. It means we will need bigger and broader measures to shore up economic demand, protect jobs, keep credit flowing to our job creators, and make sure we have the economic fire power we need to weather this storm and get our people and this economy back to full strength as soon as possible.This crisis will hit everyone, but it will hit folks who live paycheck-to-paycheck the hardest, including working people and seniors. Another tax cut to Google or Goldman or millionaires won’t get the job done. Indiscriminate corporate tax subsidies won’t effectively target those who really need help. We need to place our focus on those who will struggle just to get by. People are already losing jobs , we need to replace their wages.That includes workers in the gig economy who lack unemployment insurance.Parents who are already struggling with childcare costs , we need to give them relief. Children who rely on school lunches will need food.And schools will need help ensuring children who do not have easy access to computers can still learn if their schools close. People who have difficulty paying their rent or mortgage because they’ve been laid off or had their hours cut back , we need to help them stay in their homes. Small businesses that will be devastated as customers stay home and events are canceled , we need to make sure they have access to interest-free loans. It is a national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens do not have a single day of paid sick leave. We need , both , a permanent plan for paid sick leave and an emergency plan for everyone who needs it due to the outbreak. Beyond these national measures, my plan also calls for the creation of a State and Local Emergency Fund to make sure governors, mayors, and local leaders who are battling coronavirus on the ground have the resources necessary to meet this crisis head on.These funds could be used at the discretion of local leaders for whatever they most need: expanding critical health infrastructure, hiring additional health care and emergency service personnel, or cushioning the wider economic blow this virus will cause our communities. We need smart, bold, and compassionate leadership that will help contain the crisis, reduce hardship to our people, and help our economy rebound. But let me be clear: this is just a start. We must prepare now to take further decisive action, including direct relief, that will be large in scale and focused on the broader health and stability of our economy. But we can only protect the health of our economy, if we do everything in our power to protect the health of our people.The last point I want to make today is this , we will never fully solve this problem if we are unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the world. A disease that starts any place on the planet can be on a plane to any city on earth a few hours later. So we have to confront coronavirus everywhere. We should be leading a coordinated, global response, just as we did for Ebola, that draws on the incredible capability of the U.S. Agency for International Development and our State Department to assist vulnerable nations in detecting and treating coronavirus wherever it is spreading. We should be investing in rebuilding and strengthening the Global Health Security Agenda, which we launched during our Administration, specifically to mobilize the world against the threat of new infectious diseases. It can be hard to see the concrete value of this work when everything seems well with the world. But by cutting our investments in global health, this Administration has left us woefully ill-prepared for the exact crisis we now face. No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I’m president, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.We will lead with science. We will listen to experts and heed their advice. We will rebuild American leadership and rally the world to meet global threats. And I will always, always tell you the truth. That is the responsibility of a president. That is what is owed to the American people. Now, and in the difficult days that still lie ahead, I know that this country will summon our spirit of empathy, decency, and unity. Because, in times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. So we will meet this challenge , together. Thank you all.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-combating-coronavirus-covid-19-4228f77e9ea?source=user_profile---------126----------------------------	EmptySummary					My fellow Americans: Today, across the nation, many of us are feeling anxious about the rapid spread of COVID-19, known as the coronavirus, and the threat it poses to our health, our loved ones, and our livelihoods. I know people are worried, and my thoughts are with all those who are directly fighting this virus , those infected, families that have suffered a loss, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others. And I'd like to thank those who are already making sacrifices to protect us , whether that's self-quarantining or cancelling events or closing campuses. Because whether or not you are infected, or know someone who is infected, or have been in contact with an infected person , this will require a national response. Not just from our elected leaders or our public health officials , from all of us. We all must follow the guidance of health officials and take appropriate precautions , to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease. It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings. That is why earlier this week, on the recommendation of officials, my campaign cancelled the election night rally we had planned to hold in Cleveland, Ohio. We will also be re-imagining the format for the large-crowd events we had planned in Chicago and Miami in the coming days. And we will continue to assess and adjust how we conduct our campaign as we move forward, and find new ways to share our message with the public, while putting the health and safety of the American people first. Yesterday, we announced a Public Health Advisory Committee of experts who will counsel our campaign and help guide our decisions on steps to minimize the risk. We will be led by the science. The World Health Organization has now officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation will only hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia. Labeling COVID-19 a 'foreign virus' does not displace accountability for the mismanagement that we have seen from the Trump Administration. Let me be crystal clear: the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation. It will infect Republicans and Democrats alike. It will not discriminate based on national origin,race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. A wall will not stop it. Banning all travel from Europe, or any other part of the world, may slow it , but as we have seen , it will not stop it. And travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics , rather than risk , will be counterproductive. This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet. And we need a plan about how we are going to aggressively manage it here at home. The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will face this with the same spirit that has guided us through previous crises. We will come together as a nation. We will look out for one another and do our part as citizens. We have to harness the ingenuity of our scientists and the resourcefulness of our people. And we have to lead the world to drive a coordinated global strategy, not shut ourselves off from it. Protecting the health and safety of the American people is the most important job of any president , and unfortunately, this virus has laid bare the severe shortcomingsof the current Administration. Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by his adversarial relationship with the truth. Our government's ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the hollowing-out of our agencies and the disparagement of science. And our ability to drive a global response is dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world. We have to get to work immediately to dig ourselves out of this hole. That is why, today, I am releasing a plan to combat and overcome the coronavirus. The full details are on JoeBiden.com laying out the immediate steps we must take to deliver: A decisive public health response to curb the spread of this disease and provide treatment to those in need; and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief to American workers, families, and small businesses , and protects the economy as a whole. I offer it as a roadmap, not for what I will do as president 10 months from now, but for the leadership I believe is required right now, in this moment. President Trump is welcome to adopt it today. The core principle is simple: public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions and communicating with the American people. It would be a step toward reclaiming public trust and confidence in the United States government and toward stopping the fear and chaos that can overtake communities faster than this pandemic. And it's critical to mounting an effective national response that will save lives, protect our front-line health workers, and slow the spread of this virus. First, anyone who needs to be tested based on medical guidelines, should be tested , at no charge. The Administration's failure on testing is colossal. It is a failure of planning, leadership, and execution. The White House should measure and report each day how many tests were ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands. We should make sure every person in a nursing home, a senior center, or a vulnerable population has easy access to a test. We should establish hundreds of mobile testing sites , at least 10 per state , and drive-thru testing centers to speed testing and protect health care workers. The CDC, private labs, universities, and manufacturers should be working in lock-step to get this done, and get it done right. No effort should be spared. No excuses should be made. Tests should be available to all who need them and the government should stop at nothing to make that happen. We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it, and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hopes of protecting political interests or the stock market. The markets will respond to strong, steady, capable leadership that addresses the root of the problem, not efforts to cover it up. Second, we need to surge our capability to both prevent and treat the coronavirus, and prepare our hospitals to deal with an influx of those needing care. This means not just getting out the testing kits and processing them quickly, but making sure communities have the hospital beds, the staff, the medical supplies, and the personal protective equipment necessary to treat patients. The president should order FEMA to prepare the capacity with local authorities to establish temporary hospitals with hundreds of beds on short notice. The Department of Defense should prepare for the potential deployment of its resources to provide medical facility capacity and logistical support. A week from now, a month from now, we could need an instant, 500-bed hospital to isolate and treat patients in any city in the country. We can do that , but we aren't ready yet, and the clock is ticking.As we take these steps, state, federal, and local authorities need to ensure that there is accurate, up-to-date information easily available to every American so everyone can make an informed decision about when to get tested, when to self-quarantine, and when to seek medical treatment. And the federal government should provide states and municipalities with clear guidance about when to trigger more aggressive mitigation policies, such as closing schools. Third, we need to accelerate the development of treatments and a vaccine. Science takes time. It will still be many months before we have a vaccine that can be proven safe for public use and produced in sufficient quantity to make a difference. Therapeutics can and should come sooner. That will save lives. We passed the Cures Act in 2016 to accelerate work at the National Institutes of Health, but now it must have every available resource to speed the process along. We must fast-track clinical trials within the NIH, while closely coordinating with the Food and Drug Administration on trial approvals, so that the science is not hindered by the bureaucracy. And, when we do have a vaccine ready to go, it should also be made widely available, free of charge. We should also immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense -with a full-time, dedicated coordinator to oversee the response. Our Administration created that office to better respond to future global health threats after the Ebola crisis in 2014. It was designed for exactly this scenario. President Trump eliminated the office two years ago. Here's the bottom line: we have to do what is necessary to beat this challenge sooner rather than later. I assure you, if we wait for it to worsen then scramble to catch up, the human and economic toll will be far greater and last far longer.

MEJB1832020118	Joe Biden	2020-03-18	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Immediate Actions the Trump Administration Must Take to Address the Public Health Crisis	My heart goes out to all Americans who are suffering from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus , those who are sick, those who are caring for others, those who have lost loved ones, those who cannot spend time with family members due to social distancing, and those who are already dealing with the economic fallout.I’m so proud of Americans across the country who are driving a community-led response, despite the sacrifices and hardship that can entail, and by helping their neighbors. The people of this country know how to answer the call in a crisis. They know that now is a time for empathy, decency, and unity.The Congress is hard at work at economic measures to help working people, families, and seniors cope with the economic blow. So many governors, mayors, and other local officials on the front lines of the pandemic are making tough decisions to protect their communities and modeling the leadership we need from our elected officials. They deserve a partner in the White House.Much has been made of changes in the President’s tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink , and so many lives at stake , it’s time to be less interested in the President’s words and more focused on his actions , or inaction.Here’s what President Trump needs to do, immediately:First, he must institute a transparent reporting process regarding testing. While it’s good that the number of tests are increasing, it’s not good enough. Other countries have had the tests they’ve needed, when they’ve needed them. The United States hasn’t , and still doesn’t. Last week, I called for the Administration to report every single day on how many tests have been ordered, how many have been conducted, and how many have produced positive results. That reporting still is not happening. It must.Second, President Trump must take action to expand the number of beds and facilities ready to accept sick patients. Last week, I called for using our Department of Defense resources and the deployment of the National Guard, if necessary, to help support the response. I’m proud to see governors taking this step and acting in the interests of their communities. And I’m pleased that the Pentagon announced yesterday that it is opening its labs, prepping its hospital ships, and making equipment like respirator masks and ventilators available. The Trump Administration should act now to prepare for the deployment of beds and facilities.Third, President Trump must surge medical personnel to the places that need it most and make sure these personnel and first responders are equipped to more safely do their jobs. As I called for last week, this should include expanding and mobilizing the Medical Reserve Corps, which consists of nearly 200,000 volunteer health care professionals who stand ready to serve across America. And, this should include standing up a reserve Corps for the U.S. Public Health Service so we have the medical and public health expertise available to deploy to areas of need. It should also include adapting FEMA just-in-time training for first responders through the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, the Center for Domestic Preparedness, and the Emergency Management Institute. And all of our medical personnel and first responders should have the personal protective equipment they need to ensure they can do their jobs safely and effectively.This leads to a final point: Vital equipment is in short supply, including personal protective equipment for health care providers and first responders, basic supplies for lab technicians, and ventilators for patients. One reason for that is Trump’s misguided trade war with China, which led to tariffs on essential medical supplies and reduced their availability in the United States.Today, I am calling on the Trump Administration to take the following steps immediately:(1) Level with the American people by providing accurate and complete information on:(2) Prioritize and immediately increase domestic production of any critical medical equipment required to respond to this crisis , such as the production of ventilators and associated training to operate , by invoking the Defense Production Act, delegating authority to HHS and FEMA. This action must be built on forecasted demand, using the best modeling currently available for negative scenarios. It would involve:The Administration should provide a regular update to the public on the status of all of these steps, which should be taken under the guidance and direction of experts and public health and emergency response professionals. Also, Congress gave the White House more than $8 billion to fight the virus 12 days ago. The White House should report weekly on how quickly and well that money is being used.Americans are already making sacrifices and readjusting their lives, and I know that as a people, we are capable of meeting this challenge, coming together, caring for one another, and saving lives. We just need President Trump and his Administration to demonstrate the same level of dedication and aggressive leadership at the federal level to mount an effective national response.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-immediate-actions-the-trump-administration-must-take-to-57857de533b8?source=user_profile---------124----------------------------	EmptySummary					My heart goes out to all Americans who are suffering from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus , those who are sick, those who are caring for others, those who have lost loved ones, those who cannot spend time with family members due to social distancing, and those who are already dealing with the economic fallout.I'm so proud of Americans across the country who are driving a community-led response, despite the sacrifices and hardship that can entail, and by helping their neighbors.

MEJB1832020119	Joe Biden	2020-03-18	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Joe Biden in Wilmington, DE	Good evening everyone. Last week, I had the honor of speaking to all of you from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the foundational documents of our democracy. Tonight, in keeping with the latest guidance from the CDC to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, I am speaking to you from my home in Wilmington. I hope that all of you are staying safe, taking the recommended precautions to keep social distance, and slow the spread of the coronavirus. This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our lives, and every aspect of this campaign. My heart goes out to all those who have lost a loved one, to those who have contracted the virus, and to all of the brave Americans who are working harder than ever to help their neighbors. Doctors, nurses, EMTs, and public health officials, as well as front line emergency workers like fire fighters and the dedicated folks working to keep the shelves stocked in grocery stores. Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war. It will require leadership and cooperation from every level of government. It will require us to move thoughtfully and decisively to quickly address both the public health crisis and the economic crisis we’re in. It will require us to pay attention to the medical and scientific and health experts. And it will require each and every one of us to do our part. Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it is also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals, and collectively as a people, will make a big difference in the severity of the outbreak and the ability of our medical and hospital systems to handle it. I know that we as a people are up to this challenge. I know that we will answer this moment of crisis with what is best in ourselves , because that is what Americans have always done. That’s who we are. And today, even as we are moving quickly to adapt our routines to meet this challenge, Americans in three states went to the polls. I want to thank all the public officials and the poll workers who worked closely with public health authorities to assure safe opportunities for voting , to clean and disinfect voting booths and to make sure that voters could cast their ballots while maintaining distance from one another. It is important for us to get through this crisis, protecting both the public health and our democracy. Today, it looks like, once again, in Florida and in Illinois , and we’re still waiting to hear in Arizona , our campaign has had a very good night. And we’ve moved closer to securing the Democratic party’s nomination for president. We’re doing it by building the broad coalition that we will need to win in November with strong support from the African American community; the Latino community; high school educated people, like the ones I grew up with in my old neighborhood; labor; teachers, suburban women, veterans, fire fighters, and so many more. And we’re doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision , for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans to reducing income inequality to taking on climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought remarkable passion and tenacity to these issues, and together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in the country. And let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify our party , and to unify our nation. It’s at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. We are all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe in the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor. To understand the fear and stress so many are feeling. To care for the elderly couple down the street. To thank the health workers and the doctors and the nurses and the pharmacists and the grocery store cashiers and the people re-stocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you , when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up, and we’ll get through this together. May God bless you all , and we say a special prayer for those on the front lines of this crisis , the doctors, the nurses, the health care workers caring for virus victims and their families.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-joe-biden-in-wilmington-de-149e7863838e?source=user_profile---------125----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good evening everyone.

We're doing it by building the broad coalition that we will need to win in November with strong support from the African American community; the Latino community; high school educated people, like the ones I grew up with in my old neighborhood; labor; teachers, suburban women, veterans, fire fighters, and so many more. And we're doing it with a common vision. Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision , for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans to reducing income inequality to taking on climate change. Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought remarkable passion and tenacity to these issues, and together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in the country. And let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify our party , and to unify our nation. It's at moments like these that we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society. We are all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe in the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor. To understand the fear and stress so many are feeling. To care for the elderly couple down the street. To thank the health workers and the doctors and the nurses and the pharmacists and the grocery store cashiers and the people re-stocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you , when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we'll lift this nation up, and we'll get through this together. May God bless you all , and we say a special prayer for those on the front lines of this crisis , the doctors, the nurses, the health care workers caring for virus victims and their families.

MEJB2332020115	Joe Biden	2020-03-23	Joe Biden Presses Donald Trump and State Elected Officials to Drop Lawsuit Attacking Americans’ Health Care	Dear President Trump, State Attorneys General, and Governor Reeves,All across this nation, Americans are anxious and afraid about the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is already having on their lives, their families, and their ability to pay their bills. Individuals and families are stepping up to do their part , staying home, taking individual precautions and implementing social distancing, and making donations to support food banks and other vital service providers, all to protect those most at-risk from the virus in our communities. Their level of dedication should be matched by their elected leaders.At a time of national emergency, which is laying bare the existing vulnerabilities in our health infrastructure, it is unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions of Americans of their health insurance and protections under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including the ban on insurers denying coverage or raising premiums due to pre-existing conditions. No American should have the added worry right now that you are in court trying to take away their health care. You are letting partisan rancor and politics threaten the lives of your constituents, and that is a dereliction of your sworn duty. I am therefore calling on each of you to drop your support of litigation to repeal the ACA.This Monday, March 23, marks 10 years since President Obama signed into law the ACA. It was , and still is , a big deal for our country, because having health insurance isn’t just about being able to access health care when you need it, it’s about the peace of mind that comes from knowing that if your kid gets sick, you will be able to get them the care they need, or that if you have an accident, you won’t have to also worry about how to pay your medical bills. During a public health crisis, it’s part of the assurance that you can seek the treatment you and your loved ones need. I was proud to stand with President Obama every day of our Administration, but no day more so than when he signed the ACA, because of the real security it delivered for every day American families.Since 2010, 20 million Americans have gained access to health insurance coverage. But the ACA also helps tens of millions more Americans across the country. It is the reason 100 million people with pre-existing conditions , including conditions like asthma and diabetes that make them at higher-risk for adverse health impacts from the coronavirus , don’t have to worry about being charged more or denied coverage. It is the reason insurance companies can’t tell patients that they’ve hit an annual or lifetime cap on care.The litigation you are supporting , Texas v. California , jeopardizes every single one of those protections and threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of Americans. There is no underlying constitutional flaw with the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Supreme Court twice upheld the constitutionality of the law. The only reason this new case gained traction was because Congressional Republicans decided to amend the law and zero-out the penalty for not being insured, and legal experts from across the ideological spectrum have concluded that this new argument , that this change invalidates the entire law , is legally unsupportable.The purpose of your suit is to destroy the ACA. Make no mistake: If the ACA did not exist right now, in this public health crisis, tens of millions of people would not have health insurance. 100 million would not have protections for the kind of underlying conditions that make them even more vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19. Insurance companies would be allowed to place caps on care provided to individuals. And if you succeed in killing it next year, you’ll put countless Americans at risk in the next pandemic.If there was ever a moment to set aside politics, it is now. I have called for making all testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccine free of charge, regardless of whether an individual is insured. That is what is needed to defeat this virus. The last thing we need right now is people avoiding seeking care because they can’t afford it. But people will still have medical needs not directly related to COVID-19, which is why every American needs access to high-quality, affordable health insurance and the pre-existing condition protections that the law guarantees.You have in your power the ability to make life safer, healthier, and a little bit easier for your constituents. All you have to do is drop your support for this ill-conceived lawsuit, which is even more dangerous and cruel in this moment of national crisis. History will judge all of us by how we respond to this pandemic. The public health imperative we now face is bigger than politics, and it requires all of us to summon the courage to lead and to do what is right for the American people.Thank you,Joseph R.

MEJB2332020116	Joe Biden	2020-03-23	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Congressional Economic Stimulus Negotiations	It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s simply wrong. Here’s what’s happening. The White House and the Senate Republicans have proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations, with almost no conditions. Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary would decide which big businesses get how much, and he can give out billions with virtually no strings attached. The Trump Administration could even allow companies to use taxpayers’ money for stock buybacks and executive pay packages, and they don’t have to tell Americans where the money is going for months. This is par for the course for this president. We have just watched too many CEOs spend the last few years squandering the massive Trump corporate tax cuts on buying back their own stock and increasing their own compensation, rather than investing in their workers or making their businesses more sustainable. No more blank checks to corporations. Any lifelines to big companies should ensure the aid lifts up workers, instead of enriching CEOs or shareholders. If these companies are taking money from taxpayers, they must make an enforceable commitment that they will keep workers on payroll. We can’t let Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell hold small businesses, workers, and communities hostage until they get their no-strings corporate bailout. McConnell should immediately allow a bipartisan vote on aggressive measures to help small businesses, workers, and communities first, so the relief they need can get moving. To make matters worse, as they carry water for corporate America, President Trump and Mitch McConnell are refusing to give states and communities on the front lines the help they need to deal with the crisis they are facing. They are refusing to provide sufficient, sustainable relief to workers. They are denying millions the emergency paid leave they deserve to help keep families safe. They are refusing to forgive a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person. They are refusing to increase Social Security benefits for our seniors and people with disabilities. They are refusing to provide enough health coverage or Medicaid funding during a public health emergency. And they are refusing to take the necessary steps to ensure food and nutrition for vulnerable families or to prevent these families from losing their homes. This is a time to help families, communities, and small businesses. The people trying to pay mortgages and rent, student loans and urgent bills , they need help and they shouldn’t have to pay for a corporate handout before they get it. The family-run restaurant that is trying to stay open and pay its workers , they need a lifeline. The worker who is losing hours and therefore losing wages , they need to be made whole. The family that will go hungry tonight , they need food on the table. Those losing jobs , they need strong, sustained unemployment benefits whether they are a gig worker or a full-time employee. Social Security checks need to be boosted. Student debt should be forgiven. Cash relief needs to go out fast to all of the people who need it the most. These are the hardworking, struggling Americans who should come first , not the big corporations looking for a blank check. That’s not only good economics. That’s who we are as Americans , we lend a hand to help each other, we step up when hard times fall. We all deserve leadership that does the same.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-congressional-economic-stimulus-negotiations-99bf4f6daafc?source=user_profile---------122----------------------------	EmptySummary					It's simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.

MEJB2632020114	Joe Biden	2020-03-26	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Record Unemployment Claims	Last week saw the largest single-week jump in new unemployment claims in American history , 3.3 million people filed for unemployment, and likely many more than that are now out of work as people are staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19. These numbers reflect overwhelming job losses in service industries like accommodation and food service, which means lower-income workers are already feeling the impact of this crisis in a major way. Secretary Mnuchin may think these numbers “are not relevant,” but for those who were already struggling to make ends meet, this is a very real crisis.That’s why we have to do whatever is necessary to get the relief the Senate just approved to these families fast , and to keep as many Americans on the payroll as possible.The President is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because our president didn’t do his job when it mattered.Nearly every country is facing this pandemic , but not every country has responded the same way. South Korea, among other steps, deployed intensive testing and contact-tracing measures to slow and control the spread of the virus. Donald Trump didn’t do that. He didn’t get ahead of it when he had the chance. And in the absence of an early, aggressive response to flatten the curve, cities and states have been left with no option other than extreme social distancing measures, causing businesses to close and lay off workers. Now we are facing the economic fallout as well as a worsening public health crisis.The White House’s mindset needs to shift. Effective planning, implementation, and execution are required to address this public health and economic crisis. The Congress is stepping up and doing its job by providing generous and timely unemployment insurance. But once the relief bill is signed into law, Trump will still have to do the hard work to execute it effectively: getting the funds out the door to make those who were laid off financially whole and the small business loans distributed to keep as many people on payroll as possible.But none of that will ultimately matter if we can’t defeat the coronavirus. We won’t be able to revive the economy and get people back to work without a public health action plan that saves lives and halts the virus as quickly as possible.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-record-unemployment-claims-97391f210e7b?source=user_profile---------120----------------------------	EmptySummary					Last week saw the largest single-week jump in new unemployment claims in American history , 3.3 million people filed for unemployment, and likely many more than that are now out of work as people are staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Dreamers are deeply ingrained in every aspect of our society, including as doctors and nurses, home health aides, and physicians assistants.

MEJB3132020112	Joe Biden	2020-03-31	I stand with Mashpee — and with all of Indian Country.	This past weekend, in the midst of a pandemic, the Trump Administration chose to expend effort and resources to attempt to remove land that the Obama-Biden Administration put into trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and disestablish the Tribe’s reservation , before the Tribe had exhausted its ability to appeal in the courts. This is unacceptable and betrays an incredible disrespect for Mashpee rights.U.S. policy has for too long broken trust with tribal nations. It’s time to choose a different path. One of the most important roles the federal government plays in rebuilding the nation-to-nation relationship is taking land into trust on behalf of tribes. It is critical for tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It preserves tribal histories and culture for future generations. It allows for economic development and helps support the well-being of tribal citizens. It helps to right the wrongs of past policy, including the dispossession by the U.S. government of 90 million acres of tribal land, nearly two-thirds of all tribal land. The Obama-Biden Administration recognized this vital responsibility and took more than half a million acres of land into trust for tribes , including for Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe.The Supreme Court’s Carcieri decision made fulfilling that responsibility harder by restricting the federal government’s ability to put land into trust. When I served as Vice President, our Administration asked Congress to enact a clean fix of the Carcieri decision. We also included language in our budgets to make clear that addressing this decision was a priority. Our Department of Interior developed a post-Carcieri framework to determine if tribes were under federal jurisdiction before 1934, and our Department of Justice used this framework to defend the process of taking land into trust. Indeed, courts that reviewed decisions under that framework embraced Interior’s analysis. But the Trump Administration has callously reversed the Obama-Biden policies, and abandoned our nation’s treaty obligations to tribal nations.Upholding tribal self-governance and sovereignty, respecting tribal reserved rights in treaties, and supporting the federal trust responsibility to tribal nations should be the cornerstones of our federal tribal policy. That’s why, as president, I will support a clean Carcieri fix.I stand with Mashpee , and with all of Indian Country.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/i-stand-with-mashpee-and-with-all-of-indian-country-a58e4bcdc578?source=user_profile---------118----------------------------	EmptySummary					This past weekend, in the midst of a pandemic, the Trump Administration chose to expend effort and resources to attempt to remove land that the Obama-Biden Administration put into trust for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and disestablish the Tribe's reservation , before the Tribe had exhausted its ability to appeal in the courts.

Our Department of Interior developed a post-Carcieri framework to determine if tribes were under federal jurisdiction before 1934, and our Department of Justice used this framework to defend the process of taking land into trust. Indeed, courts that reviewed decisions under that framework embraced Interior's analysis. But the Trump Administration has callously reversed the Obama-Biden policies, and abandoned our nation's treaty obligations to tribal nations.Upholding tribal self-governance and sovereignty, respecting tribal reserved rights in treaties, and supporting the federal trust responsibility to tribal nations should be the cornerstones of our federal tribal policy. That's why, as president, I will support a clean Carcieri fix.I stand with Mashpee , and with all of Indian Country.
MEJB242020110	Joe Biden	2020-04-02	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Sanctions Relief During COVID-19	In times of global crisis, America should lead. We should be the first to offer help to people who are hurting or in danger. That’s who we are. That’s who we’ve always been. And, in the midst of this deadly pandemic that respects no borders, the United States should take steps to offer what relief we can to those nations hardest hit by this virus , including Iran , even as we prioritize the health of the American people.Iran is struggling to contain one of the deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks in the world. While the Iranian government has failed to respond effectively to this crisis, including lying and concealing the truth from its own people, and it continues to act provocatively in the region, the Iranian people are hurting desperately. It is bad enough that the Trump administration abandoned the Iran nuclear deal in favor of a “maximum pressure” strategy that has badly backfired, encouraging Iran to become even more aggressive and restart its nuclear program. It makes no sense, in a global health crisis, to compound that failure with cruelty by inhibiting access to needed humanitarian assistance. Whatever our profound differences with the Iranian government, we should support the Iranian people.There are already humanitarian exceptions in place for sanctions, but in practice, most governments and organizations are too concerned about running afoul of U.S. sanctions to offer assistance. As a result, our sanctions are limiting Iran’s access to medical supplies and needed equipment. The Trump Administration should take immediate steps to address this problem and streamline channels for banking and public health assistance from other countries in response to the health emergency in Iran.Specific steps should include: issuing broad licenses to pharmaceutical and medical device companies; creating a dedicated channel for international banks, transportation companies, insurers, and other service firms to help Iranians access life-saving medical treatment; issuing new sanctions guidance to these groups and international aid organizations to make it clear how they can immediately, directly, and legally respond to the tragedy in Iran, without fear of penalty; and, for entities already conducting enhanced due diligence, it should issue comfort letters to reassure them that they will not be subject to U.S. sanctions if they engage in humanitarian trade with Iran to support its COVID-19 response. The administration should also consider similar steps to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not inhibit live-saving medical assistance to other countries hard hit by the virus.The administration’s offer of aid to Iran is insufficient if not backed by concrete steps to ensure the United States is not exacerbating this growing humanitarian crisis. Whatever our many, many disagreements with the Iranian government, it’s the right and the humane thing to do. And Iran also should make a humanitarian gesture and allow detained American citizens to return home.To stop this pandemic effectively, every country on earth will need to work together. We must address COVID-19 outbreaks wherever they occur, because as long as this virus is spreading anywhere in the world, it is a danger to public health everywhere. Artificially limiting the flow of international humanitarian assistance to pursue a political point will not only allow the Iranian government to deflect responsibility for its own botched response, it will increase the threat this virus poses to the American people, now and in the future.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-sanctions-relief-during-covid-19-f7c2447416f0?source=user_profile---------116----------------------------	EmptySummary					In times of global crisis, America should lead.

MEJB242020111	Joe Biden	2020-04-02	Statement from Vice President Joe Biden on Record Number of Americans Filing for Unemployment	The economic damage from the worst public health crisis our country has faced in generations is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain , and they need to be made whole as fast as possible. My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed for unemployment claims this week, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them. Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation: for the months during which he continually neglected dire warnings from experts and downplayed the threat to us, and for the erratic and unacceptably slow federal response that has tragically lagged behind other countries. Now we have more coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world, and that is dealing body-blows to our economy and to the welfare and well-being of millions upon millions of Americans. Just last week, Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary referred to these kinds of job losses as “not relevant” , but try telling that to any one of the millions of Americans who are now out of work because of this crisis. The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing by no fault of their own means. We have to take extraordinary steps to protect them. We need to get unemployment checks to the workers filing claims, so they are made financially whole. No blame games or finger-points , the President has to take responsibility for helping the states make that happen. We still need to keep as many workers on payroll as possible, and as many small businesses in business. And we need to get the direct cash relief into Americans’ bank accounts without delay. The bills are piling up. And we have to guarantee that Americans without health care coverage can get it. The President must change course and allow open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, as even Republican governors have called on him to do. He should also drop his support for a lawsuit that would undo the ACA, because it would cost almost 20 million Americans their care , the last thing we should pursue during a public health emergency.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-joe-biden-on-record-number-of-americans-filing-for-unemployment-ec9e50223e7e?source=user_profile---------117----------------------------	EmptySummary					The economic damage from the worst public health crisis our country has faced in generations is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate.

At its heart, this is a holiday about coming together to overcome the sternest of challenges , and meeting adversity with generosity, optimism, and faith. The story of the exodus from Egypt is a call to resilience, but also a call to empathy; it recounts how God delivered the ancient Israelites from bondage, but carries vital lessons about the values of community and connection that make freedom worthwhile. And while the Haggadah is grounded in the past, it also sheds light on how we might rise above the crises of the present and future with our humanity intact.Jill and I know how hard it is for so many families, friends, and communities to not be physically together at Passover this year. The thought of all those grandchildren and grandparents, siblings and cousins, neighbors, and strangers in need who will mark their Passover seders alone this year tears at our hearts. But we also know that you are still together in the senses ofthe word that matter most; blocks away or miles apart, across virtual connections and the connection of common faith, you nevertheless celebrate as one.If Passover teaches us anything, it’s that a united and open-hearted people can come through any challenge and emerge stronger on the other side. The American people and the people of all nations are facing down a new challenge today , a treacherous journey across unfamiliar terrain. And like the heroes of the Passover story, we will survive that journey by calling upon the values that define us: our caring for strangers, our strength in unity, and our faith in better days.Jill and I wish you a happy, healthy holiday, and we are proud to walk with you on the journey ahead.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/vice-president-bidens-passover-message-d43ae4e03ce8?source=user_profile---------114----------------------------	EmptySummary					As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating.In these difficult times, the message of Passover resonates with us as never before.

MEJB842020107	Joe Biden	2020-04-08	Statement From Vice President Biden	Today, Senator Sanders announced he was suspending his campaign. Bernie has put his heart and soul into not only running for President, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. So, I know how hard a decision this was for him to make , and how hard it is for the millions of his supporters , especially younger voters , who have been inspired and energized and brought into politics by the progressive agenda he has championed. Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn’t just run a political campaign; he’s created a movement. And make no mistake about it, I believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.Senator Sanders and his supporters have changed the dialogue in America. Issues which had been given little attention , or little hope of ever passing , are now at the center of the political debate. Income inequality, universal health care, climate change, free college, relieving students from the crushing debt of student loans. These are just a few of the issues Bernie and his supporters have given life to. And while Bernie and I may not agree on how we might get there, we agree on the ultimate goal for these issues and many more.But more than any one issue or set of issues, I want to commend Bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America. It’s voices like Bernie’s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is , that refuse to accept we can’t change what’s wrong in our nation , that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn’t our responsibility too. Bernie gets a lot of credit for his passionate advocacy for the issues he cares about. But he doesn’t get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough.While the Sanders campaign has been suspended , its impact on this election and on elections to come is far from over. We will address the existential crisis of climate change. We will confront income inequality in our nation. We will make sure healthcare is affordable and accessible to every American. We will make education at our public colleges and universities free. We will ease the burden of student debt. And, most important of all, we will defeat Donald Trump.At this moment, we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis in American history. There is enormous fear and pain and loss being felt all across the country. There are also untold stories of heroism , of nurses and health care workers and doctors and first responders and grocery store workers and truck drivers and so many others on the front lines of this crisis. Putting their own lives in danger for the rest of us. If we didn’t know it before, we know it now: This is the backbone of our nation.Our first job is to get through the immediate crisis threatening the public health and getting help into the pockets of America’s workers. But we also need to take a hard look at what we need to fix and change in this country. Many of the biggest cracks in the social safety net have been laid bare , from health care to paid sick leave to a more extensive and comprehensive system of unemployment benefits. We will need to address these. Just as we need to address rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure. And we all know , the clock is ticking , we don’t have a moment to waste in combating the climate crisis.As friends, Jill and I want to say to Bernie and Jane, we know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation , and the need to defeat Donald Trump , above all else. And for that Jill and I are grateful. But we also want you to know: I’ll be reaching out to you. You will be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.And to your supporters I make the same commitment: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You’re needed.Together we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we’ll not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation , we’ll transform it.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-biden-5de128a935ac?source=user_profile---------113----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, Senator Sanders announced he was suspending his campaign.

MEJB942020105	Joe Biden	2020-04-09	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Racial Inequities of COVID-19	This is an anxious, difficult time for Americans all across this nation. We’re all worried about our health and our families. And for the millions who have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed, you may also be worried about just making ends meet. As a nation, we are being tested as never before, and I want to offer my heartfelt sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones to this virus as well as my heartfelt gratitude to all the frontline workers who are literally carrying our nation on their backs.This pandemic is shining a light on so many inequities in our society , the lack of paid sick leave for workers, the need for stronger unemployment insurance, the necessity for a livable minimum wage. Unsurprisingly, it’s also amplifying the structural racism that is built into so much of our daily lives, our institutions, our laws, and our communities.An early data analysis from the Washington Post indicates that counties with majority-Black populations have coronavirus infection rates three times higher than counties with majority white residents, with death rates nearly six times higher. In some parts of the country, Latinos appear to be harder hit as well. And, we’ve also seen reports of climbing infections and death tolls among the Navajo Nation and fears about the disproportionate impact the virus could have on Indian Country.It’s unconscionable, and it shouldn’t be the case in the United States of America in the 21st century. But we know exactly why it is: Black, Latino, and Native Americans are still less likely to have health insurance. Less likely to have access to health care. More likely to have underlying conditions, like asthma and diabetes, that make them more vulnerable to this virus. And, more likely to face exposure to air pollutants that may be associated with higher COVID-19 death rates. Black and Latino Americans are also less likely to have a job they can just do from home. Meaning they’re more likely to have to choose between their health and a paycheck.This pandemic has shown us the importance of leading with science and following the data , but we can’t follow the data if we don’t have it. That’s why I join my Democratic colleagues Senator Warren, Congresswoman Pressley, Senator Harris, Senator Booker, Congresswoman Kelly, and others in calling on the CDC and other agencies to release more data about how COVID-19 is hurting our communities. Not just data on age, but also on income and race, so we can focus resources on where help is needed first and fastest.This virus can hit anyone, anywhere , regardless of race, economic status, or access to power , but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources. The challenge for us as leaders is ensuring support gets to those who need it immediately, and doing the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities wherever we find it.We can do better for all our people. We have to.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-racial-inequities-of-covid-19-5e4f17f8fa0c?source=user_profile---------111----------------------------	EmptySummary					This is an anxious, difficult time for Americans all across this nation.

MEJB942020106	Joe Biden	2020-04-09	Joe Biden Outlines New Steps to Ease Economic Burden on Working People	Two important steps we can take to help ease the economic burden on working people , and that I will take when I am President.The news this morning of another enormous number of unemployment claims , on top of the ten million that have already been filed , is devastating. These numbers represent catastrophic losses to our economy, but most importantly, they represent the loss of livelihood for millions of people across this country struggling to pay the rent, put food on the table, and keep the electricity on.These aren’t statistics this morning , these are people. They are fathers, mothers, aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and grandparents who have lost their jobs.The economic crisis brought on by this virus is both accelerating and deepening. These unemployment numbers today are another flashing warning sign that our country and our people will endure enormous economic pain. It is our responsibility to move quickly and effectively to help them.Congress has moved to help with the CARES Act, but they must do more. In addition to funds to keep workers on payroll, the next recovery package will need to provide significant funds to states, to make sure that educators and health care workers and first responders can keep getting paid. It will have to provide hazard pay to frontline workers putting themselves at risk. It will have to provide health care coverage for millions who lose their insurance, by allowing them to stay on their health care plans and covering the cost, as well as reopening enrollment for Obamacare and creating the public option I’ve been calling for. It will have to extend unemployment benefits, and provide further direct cash relief, and take care of the people left out of the CARES Act, through an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren, and Social Security boosts. And so much more.And we must , must , make sure not only that every American can be tested for coronavirus free of cost, but also make sure every American can be treated for coronavirus free of cost. Period.And that’s just immediate relief. Then comes recovery. Recovery will require long term changes to build a more inclusive and more resilient middle class, and a greener and more resilient economy. We have to think big , as big as the challenges we face. As we start to lay the groundwork for recovery, we have to build back better for the future.So, as the next step in building on the progressive vision for the country that I have laid out across the course of my campaign, today I’m announcing my intention to fight for two new policies that I believe will not only help people right now when they may need the help most, but will also help people find more secure footing in the long term once we have emerged from this crisis. The first is lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60, and the second is forgiving student debt for low-income and middle class people who have attended public colleges and universities.And to be clear , these are priorities now, but they will be my program when I am President.Lowering the Medicare Eligibility Age to 6,I have directed my team to develop a plan to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60.Under this concept, Americans would have access, if they choose, to Medicare when they turn 60, instead of when they turn 65. Medicare benefits would be provided to them as they are to current Medicare recipients. This would make Medicare available to a set of Americans who work hard and retire before they turn 65, or who would prefer to leave their employer plans, the public option, or other plans they access through the Affordable Care Act before they retire. It reflects the reality that, even after the current crisis ends, older Americans are likely to find it difficult to secure jobs.Of course, those who prefer to remain on their employer plans would be permitted to do so, and employers would have to comply with non-discrimination laws and would be prohibited from excluding older workers from coverage or otherwise try to push them out of their plans. And the Biden Medicare-like public option , as well as other subsidized private plans available to individuals through the Affordable Care Act , would remain available.Any new Federal cost associated with this option would be financed out of general revenues to protect the Medicare Trust Fund.Forgiving student debt for low-income and middle class individuals who have attended public colleges and universitie,I’ve also directed my team to develop a plan to forgive federal student debt relating to the cost of tuition currently held by low-income and middle-class people for undergraduate public colleges and universities, as well as private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and private, underfunded Minority-Serving Institution (MSIs).The concept I’m announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal. Under this plan, I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, with appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This benefit would also apply to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private HBCUs and MSIs.This proposal would be in addition to my existing student debt proposals:I would finance this new student debt proposal by repealing the high-income “excess business losses” tax cut in the CARES Act. That tax cut overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans and is unnecessary for addressing the current COVID-19 economic relief efforts.I will be releasing more detail on both of these proposals in the future But I believe that as we are being plunged into what is likely to be one of the most volatile and difficult economic times in this country’s recent history, we can take these critical steps to help make it easier for working people to make ends meet. Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I’m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis.In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger. This one will be no different. Americans will come together and take care of each other , we are already seeing it every day. Doctors, nurses and hospital workers putting their own safety aside to care for others. Neighbors looking out for neighbors who need extra help. We can do anything we put our minds to, even in the most difficult times , and includes rebuilding for a better future.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322?source=user_profile---------112----------------------------	EmptySummary					Two important steps we can take to help ease the economic burden on working people , and that I will take when I am President.The news this morning of another enormous number of unemployment claims , on top of the ten million that have already been filed , is devastating. These numbers represent catastrophic losses to our economy, but most importantly, they represent the loss of livelihood for millions of people across this country struggling to pay the rent, put food on the table, and keep the electricity on.These aren't statistics this morning , these are people. They are fathers, mothers, aunts, uncles, sons, daughters, and grandparents who have lost their jobs.The economic crisis brought on by this virus is both accelerating and deepening. These unemployment numbers today are another flashing warning sign that our country and our people will endure enormous economic pain. It is our responsibility to move quickly and effectively to help them.Congress has moved to help with the CARES Act, but they must do more. In addition to funds to keep workers on payroll, the next recovery package will need to provide significant funds to states, to make sure that educators and health care workers and first responders can keep getting paid. It will have to provide hazard pay to frontline workers putting themselves at risk. It will have to provide health care coverage for millions who lose their insurance, by allowing them to stay on their health care plans and covering the cost, as well as reopening enrollment for Obamacare and creating the public option I've been calling for. It will have to extend unemployment benefits, and provide further direct cash relief, and take care of the people left out of the CARES Act, through an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren, and Social Security boosts. And so much more.And we must , must , make sure not only that every American can be tested for coronavirus free of cost, but also make sure every American can be treated for coronavirus free of cost. Period.And that's just immediate relief. Then comes recovery. Recovery will require long term changes to build a more inclusive and more resilient middle class, and a greener and more resilient economy. We have to think big , as big as the challenges we face. As we start to lay the groundwork for recovery, we have to build back better for the future.So, as the next step in building on the progressive vision for the country that I have laid out across the course of my campaign, today I'm announcing my intention to fight for two new policies that I believe will not only help people right now when they may need the help most, but will also help people find more secure footing in the long term once we have emerged from this crisis.

MEJB1042020104	Joe Biden	2020-04-10	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Incidents of Racism Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders	Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we’ve heard increasing reports of Asian Americans in communities across our country being targeted with messages of hate. There are stories of Asian Americans being spit on while walking down the street, enduring verbal and physical assaults, finding their cars vandalized with racist messages , even a suspected acid attack and stabbings. The FBI has warned about the likelihood of an increase in hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. And, some people of AAPI descent have even spoken about their concerns following CDC guidance to wear a mask in public, for fear it will mark them out for unwanted attention.These disgusting and racist acts must stop. They are grounded in an impulse that is as ugly, as it is dangerously ignorant. And, it’s not who we are as a country. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where their ancestors come from, or who they are. Period.COVID-19 is a danger to everyone, and we will stop it by coming together, not by targeting people of AAPI heritage. AAPI members of our community are a vital and valued part of the American story. I’ve said from the moment I launched my campaign that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation, and we need our leaders to set the example we all must follow as a nation.Unfortunately, Donald Trump and his Administration have failed to show almost any moral leadership when it comes to this issue. Indeed, Trump’s attempts to deflect responsibility away from his own failures in addressing this pandemic by calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus” during the White House press briefings stoked feelings of hatred and anger toward AAPIs.The casual racism and regular xenophobia that we have seen from Trump and this Administration is a national scourge. Donald Trump only knows how to speak to people’s fears, not their better angels. He only ever seeks to place blame, instead of claiming responsibility. In this moment of national and global crisis, it’s clear that we need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic , including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders , with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-incidents-of-racism-against-asian-americans-and-pacific-ac6799b1586?source=user_profile---------109----------------------------	EmptySummary					Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we've heard increasing reports of Asian Americans in communities across our country being targeted with messages of hate.

It’s a reminder that after darkness, tribulation, and loss comes the dawning of new possibilities. We declare that “Christ is Risen!” to share our hope for the future and to affirm the love we have for one another, and we emerge fortified by our faith and by our community.This year, these messages of faith, connection, and rebirth are even more resonant. People are suffering from the fear and uncertainties of this pandemic; we are grieving lost loved ones; churches around the world, including St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, have cancelled their services, but our shared goodness and our innate connections as humans are shining through brighter than ever.We see the hope of Easter in the brave doctors, nurses, and first responders who risk their own lives to head into battle against this virus, and in the communities around the globe that take time each day to clap and cheer to honor them. We recognize the love that Christ bears for us in the grocery store workers and the delivery truck drivers who are working harder than ever to keep us fed and provisioned, and in the millions who are staying at home, separated to slow the spread of the virus but united in our shared mission. We are reminded by the daily acts of care and kindness that neighbors are showing to neighbors, and strangers are showing to strangers, that the promise of better days ahead is alive in each and every one of us.This Easter, Jill and I wish all of you and your families a safe and joyful celebration, and we join our prayers with those of people from every faith for health, happiness, and a renewal of life in the year to come.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-and-dr-jill-biden-on-easter-4f22fcd7116a?source=user_profile---------108----------------------------	EmptySummary					Jill and I join the many Christians around the world who tomorrow are celebrating the miracle of the resurrection and God's holy promise to His people.Easter morning is a time for joy and renewal.

Jill and I are so thankful to Barack and Michelle for their support , both politically and personally. Their friendship and the connection between our families has been a great gift.Serving for eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president was among the greatest honors of my life.When we took office in 2009, America and the world were in crisis , with our economy shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month.

By understanding the pain so many American families were feeling. By seeking to unify the nation in common purpose.These are difficult times again for our country. We’re facing a crisis even greater than what we experienced in 2009 and 2010. Lives are being lost. Our nation is shut down. Our way of life and our livelihoods are being challenged. Today, not only do we have a public health crisis, but our economy is rapidly descending into an economic crisis as well.Once again, we need to restore the qualities of presidential leadership President Obama provided , and that is what I intend to do.

MEJB1642020100	Joe Biden	2020-04-16	Joe Biden Announces New Plan to Scale Up Employment Insurance by Reforming Short-Time Compensation Program	Today, we learned that another 5.2 million people have filed unemployment claims, bringing the total to more than 22 million in the last month.This dire economic dislocation stems from the need to protect public health through strong social distancing measures. But let’s not forget: these measures are required to the extent they are because we didn’t prepare early enough, and when the virus surfaced in our communities, we didn’t test sufficiently to contain it. This pain is a product of poor decision making by Donald Trump.With true American spirit, workers did not hesitate to sacrifice to save the lives of fellow citizens. But even as we temporarily shrink economic activity, there’s no reason why the incomes of working people must shrink, too.As we navigate this crisis, our paramount economic priority must be to make American workers whole, so they retain their income and benefits during this period of social distancing. For the workers that are laid off, we should swiftly compensate for lost wages and health benefits for all of them, not just those who can make it through the bureaucracy.But we should also be doing more , much more , to reduce the number of people who are laid off in the first place. We should be committed to keeping as many people as possible attached to their employment, so they can easily return to work when appropriate, and maintain their income and benefits.This is more than just the right thing to do , it is the surest road to a rapid recovery, because the faster everyone returns to their jobs, the faster we can improve demand and get our economy running again.The Trump Administration has been given a number of extraordinary tools to make this happen , to keep people employed. Yet, they are failing to use them effectively. For more people to stay in their jobs, Donald Trump has to do his job.As this crisis continues to unfold, I will be putting forward ideas to not only better address the immediate needs of working Americans, but also what is needed for long-term, structural reform to make our economy work for all its people.So today, as we see these chilling numbers of job losses , each one a mother or father, a neighbor or friend, a proud, hardworking American , I am calling for a bigger and bolder approach to keeping people on the job in times of crisis. That idea is called “short-time compensation” or “work-sharing.” I call it Employment Insurance.The Biden Plan to Scale Up Employment Insurance by Reforming Short-Time Compensation Program,Transform unemployment insurance into Employment Insurance for millions of workers by getting all 50 states to adopt and dramatically scale up short-time compensation programs. Under short-time compensation , also known as work sharing , firms in distress keep workers employed but at reduced hours and the federal government helps make up the difference in wages. The Obama-Biden administration championed this approach in the U.S., and so far 27 states have established short-time compensation programs.These programs must become more flexible and attractive to both employers and employees, so that as many workers as possible can remain attached to their jobs and receive full wages and health benefits during crisis times, even if employers must significantly cut their hours.Germany has long used short-time work programs to protect jobs in recessions, so that workers are ready to hit the ground running as the economy improves. And this approach is especially well suited to the current moment, when we can expect a more gradual recovery in certain sectors, with some businesses operating a partial capacity for an extended period.In short, we should start thinking of this as Employment Insurance more than Unemployment Insurance.For the current crisis, the administration should move rapidly to scale up short-time compensation to save or restore millions of jobs. Specifically:These are crisis measures, but we can and should do more to strengthen short-time compensation to prevent layoffs in future downturns, learning lessons from other nations and from those states in America that have been leading the way.As President, Joe Biden would pursue permanent reform of short-time compensation, through the following steps:Build automatic triggers based on economic and public health conditions. Enhancements to short-time compensation and unemployment insurance tied to the COVID-19 crisis should be automatically extended based on economic and health conditions, and renewed in future crises. Workers and businesses should not be held hostage by partisans in Congress.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-announces-new-plan-to-scale-up-employment-insurance-by-reforming-short-time-compensation-eb0c080ce465?source=user_profile---------104----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, we learned that another 5.2 million people have filed unemployment claims, bringing the total to more than 22 million in the last month.This dire economic dislocation stems from the need to protect public health through strong social distancing measures.

MEJB224202098	Joe Biden	2020-04-22	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Earth Day	Fifty years ago, the first Earth Day took place against a backdrop of unfettered pollution filling our skies, rivers so poisonous they caught fire, unregulated use of pesticides, and threats to the livability of our planet. But in a moment of choice, Americans all across this country took action. On April 22, 1970, 20 million people turned out to educate their communities and protest the degradation of our planet, launching the modern environmental movement.It wasn’t a partisan issue. It wasn’t some ideological debate. Everyone could see that our planet was in peril. And by acting together, those activists seized the attention and the imagination of people all over the world, as well as leaders in Washington. Out of that first Earth Day came the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and a new mindset that awakened all of us to our responsibilities beyond just the world we leave our children , to ensuring that our one planet will provide for generations unborn.This year, Earth Day comes amid global crises: the difficult, immediate, and undeniable reality of pandemic disease, and the existential threat of climate change , which we are already experiencing and which threatens equally deadly results in the near future if we fail to act. COVID-19 and the climate emergency both underscore the fragility of life on this planet, the connections that bind us to our fellow humans, and the responsibility we all have to meet these global threats with urgent action, ambitious plans, and every tool at our disposal.That’s the responsibility I feel every time I look at my grandchildren and see their unlimited potential. Or when I hear from young activists who understand that inaction today is costing their futures. Today’s young people carry the same fierce spirit as those first Earth Day activists, and they are the reason I know we will succeed in spurring the world to finally raise our ambitions to meet the seriousness of this threat.This is an inflection point. A moment for all of us to come together to repair the damage to our environment caused by centuries of poorly regulated industrialization. But out of this crisis, we can also seize a moment of unmatched opportunity , to build a new, clean-energy future that remakes our economy, creates millions of good jobs that provide an opportunity to join a union, and revolutionizes our approach to environmental justice. To invest in a green infrastructure. To develop the technologies that will power tomorrow. To strengthen our resilience in the face of the impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing. To clean the air we breath and the water we drink. To revitalize our ocean and preserve our biodiversity. To deliver to our children and future generations a planet that will continue to protect and nurture them.Meeting the threat of climate change is not beyond our skill, if we are guided by science and facts. We are not helpless. We can still forestall the worst-case scenarios that the scientists have warned us about for decades , but only if we act now. If we do not take aggressive steps to rein in our greenhouse gasses, and put our world on a radically different path by 2030, we will begin to see irrevocable changes that will threaten human life on Earth.Yet, since almost the day he took office, President Donald Trump has done everything within his power to worsen the situation, sabotage our environmental protection laws and let polluters go unchecked, and reverse any progress on climate change , not just in the United States, but around the world. He denies the facts in front of his face as well as the assessments of his own intelligence analysts and government researchers. He muzzles scientists, censors research, and overruled California’s efforts to lead on climate in the absence of the federal government. He has rolled back nearly 100 commonsense regulations and functionally rescinded environmental laws governing our health and safety , air pollution went up in 2017 and 2018 after decades of improvement, and Trump has stripped protections that keep our drinking water safe. He pulled out of the Paris Agreement and left a literal empty chair where the United States should have been at the most recent G-7 meeting on climate change.Earth Day began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it’s also a reminder of everything that’s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House and restore critically needed American leadership to the global climate fight, and to clean and protect our air, water, and land. If we give Trump four more years in office at this critical juncture for our planet, there may be no recovering from the damage his dangerous dismissal of science and short-sightedness will inflict on all of us.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-earth-day-d281c27f6d8?source=user_profile---------102----------------------------	EmptySummary					Fifty years ago, the first Earth Day took place against a backdrop of unfettered pollution filling our skies, rivers so poisonous they caught fire, unregulated use of pesticides, and threats to the livability of our planet.

MEJB224202099	Joe Biden	2020-04-22	Joe Biden Calls on Trump Administration to Ensure that Relief Funds Get to Deserving Small Businesses	As Congress reaches a new deal on economic relief measures, including more funds for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, I am grateful to Democratic leaders for securing more funds for hospitals and testing, and more resources for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, as well as the depleted Emergency Injury Disaster Loan and Emergency Economic Injury Grant programs. These hard-fought improvements will help deserving small businesses who were shut out in the first round of funding. Let’s be clear: It wasn’t just a shortage of funds in the PPP that kept so many small business owners , men and women who have put their work lives, savings, heart, and soul into their businesses , from getting loans. Many had the door shut in their face , businesses like auto mechanics and main street shop owners and restaurant and bar proprietors. Many were pushed to the back of the line by chain restaurants, biotechnology companies, well-off consultants, investors, accountants, and lawyers who shouldn’t have even been in line in the first place. This was intended to be an economic crisis program to prevent the shuttering of our truly small businesses that were the most deserving , not the best connected. It was intended to be about how many jobs a small business owner could save, not how much they paid a high-priced accountant. Before the first application had been submitted for the first penny, I was demanding that Trump use his full authority to make sure every bank understood their mandate to help every small business who came through their doors or websites or phone lines. For weeks, I have been warning Trump that the funds “should be available to every single eligible small business, regardless of how small they are, where they are located, or how well-connected their owner is.” Trump didn’t listen. Consider this from early estimates:Trump and his team let banks slam doors in the face of small business owners trying to save their workers and their businesses. Under the way the Trump team administered the program, it was A-OK for a major bank like Bank of America to tell family-owned businesses that if they had relied on loved ones and not a big bank for loans in the past, their application was denied, no questions asked. Think about this: the three biggest lenders earned hundreds of millions of dollars in fees from the government for the privilege of excluding mom-and-pop businesses in favor of their larger existing clients. That was not an accident , the Trump team knew and let it happen. The Trump Administration also allowed big banks to shut the door in the face of the owner of a family restaurant, while letting major restaurant corporations in this country get their franchisees first in line for millions and millions of dollars. Again, this was not by mistake. It was permitted. I’m glad that Shake Shack is giving the money back, but a lot of the others aren’t. And we shouldn’t have to count on the conscience of the CEO , the Trump Administration should simply be saying no. African-American small business owners , who currently rely far more on friends and family than big banks, have been shut-out of the PPP in numbers that are disgraceful. Again, by Trump’s design. And, while the Trump Administration adopted an approach to disadvantage the truly small businesses facing devastation, they also adopted an approach to help their high-priced friends. This fund is running out because they allowed boutique consulting, investment, legal and accounting firms , who were doing just fine , to receive millions they did not deserve. Let’s not pretend the program is working for everyone. It’s not. In addition to adding resources, let’s fix it. Let’s get the funds to the folks who deserve it. We may still be in the early innings of the policy response, but we need to help our workers and small businesses, so we need to get this right before any new funds go out.Joe Biden’s Proposals to Support Deserving Small Businesse,Here’s what Joe Biden thinks we should do now that Congress has secured more funding: 1. Establish a True Small Business Fund: Congressional Democrats secured a set-aside of $60 billion in funds for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, which are frequently best positioned to get resources into the hands of deserving small businesses in vulnerable communities. Joe Biden is calling on the Trump Administration to go even further as it implements the PPP. The Trump Administration should reserve fully half of all the new PPP funds for small businesses with 50 employees or less, so the bigger and more sophisticated aren’t able to win in a first-come, first-served race. We should make sure we serve the mom-and-pop shops , beauty salons, barbershops, diners, local auto body shops. Back on April 3, Joe Biden asked the Trump Administration to “produce a weekly dashboard to show which small businesses are accessing loans , to make sure that the program isn’t leaving out communities, minority- and women-owned businesses, or the smallest businesses.” They have not done so. It is unacceptable to have a small-business program that is leaving minority business owners out in the cold, or that firms with fewer than 20 employees received only about 20% of the money , even though they make up about one third of payroll. Small non-profits , including churches, mosques, and synagogues , should also be eligible for this fund. The Trump Administration can do this if it makes it a priority. The country will be watching. 2. No Unjust Enrichment: Keep Well-Off Business Owners from Using Any Program to Unjustly Enrich Themselves: Our emergency programs should be designed to keep small business owners and their workers whole during the crisis , not to make well-off business owners better off than they would be with no crisis. Unfortunately, there is a very real risk of high-paid business owners suffering little revenue harm seeking to have loans forgiven that are for more than the losses they have suffered. This is just wrong. Joe Biden would expedite loans with less unnecessary paperwork to hard-hit businesses, and never punish firms or banks for good-faith mistakes. But Biden would also make clear that no business owner should be receiving more than their lost revenue , and that there should be heightened scrutiny of certain types of small businesses , consulting, accounting, legal, tax advice, hedge funds , and where owners and executives are making above $500,000. He is calling on the Trump Administration to embrace this approach in implementing the next round of funding. 3. Make Sure That the Program’s Terms Actually Help Small Businesses. Joe Biden would also support further rule changes to the PPP that would ensure deserving small businesses get all the help they need for as long as they need, including:	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-calls-on-trump-administration-to-ensure-that-relief-funds-get-to-deserving-small-60dce843e474?source=user_profile---------103----------------------------	EmptySummary					As Congress reaches a new deal on economic relief measures, including more funds for the Paycheck Protection Program (P) for small businesses, I am grateful to Democratic leaders for securing more funds for hospitals and testing, and more resources for smaller lenders and community-based financial institutions, as well as the depleted Emergency Injury Disaster Loan and Emergency Economic Injury Grant programs.

MEJB234202096	Joe Biden	2020-04-23	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Ramadan	As Muslim families across America and around the world celebrate the beginning of Ramadan, Jill and I want to extend our best wishes to all who are observing this holy month.Americans of all backgrounds have come to respect the discipline and values of Ramadan. We have stood in awe of athletes like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ibtihaj Muhammad as they abstained from food and drink during the heat of competition. We have seen Muslims give generously to strengthen our communities and lift up the most marginalized among us. Above all, we have felt the sense of unity, joy, and deep reflection that this month creates for our Muslim friends and neighbors.We know that Ramadan will feel different this year. The global pandemic and public health necessities will mean friends and family cannot come together for nightly iftar dinners, gather for communal prayers in mosques, and organize charitable activities in the community. But we also know that it is ultimately spiritual proximity , and not merely physical proximity , that makes Ramadan meaningful to those who observe. Muslim American community leaders are adapting , convening virtual mosques and hosting online iftars, channeling their charitable efforts toward those hit hardest by this crisis, praying for and honoring the lives of all those who have been lost. Perhaps most remarkably, despite the physical challenges that can come with fasting, Muslims will keep doing what they have been doing before and during this pandemic: leading on the frontlines every day as doctors, nurses, first responders, scientists, small business owners, retail workers, and more. Their service to our nation is and has always been essential, in every sense of the word.Yet even as they put their lives on the line to help their fellow Americans endure this crisis, I know that our Muslim neighbors also frequently suffer from vicious attacks and discrimination. Bigotry and ignorance have always been with us , and I strongly believe that it is one of the chief moral responsibilities of our leaders to root out and allay those sentiments rather than fan the flames of hate. I stand steadfastly with Muslim Americans against insidious and un-American actions like the Muslim Ban. In a country made strong by diversity and replenished by wave after wave of immigrants, nothing could be more antithetical to our values than government-sponsored discrimination.During this month of reflection, my heart goes out to the millions of Muslim families around the world suffering conflict, oppression, displacement, and poverty , simply because of their faith , in China, in South Asia, across the Middle East, and elsewhere. And, like people of every faith, Muslims in America and around the world now have to cope with the uncertainty and disruption caused by the coronavirus. At this moment of global crisis, it is more important than ever to recommit to our common humanity and the dignity of all people.Next year, we hope that Muslim Americans will gather together once again to celebrate and pray alongside friends and neighbors during Ramadan. And if I have the honor of being elected President, the annual White House Eid celebration will be reinstated, and the doors of the White House will reopen as a home for all Americans , and a workplace made stronger by the contributions and ideas of Muslim public servants. Until we are able to come together again, Jill and I wish Muslim families Ramadan Mubarak, and all our best wishes for the holy month ahead.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-ramadan-2e1bc3700629?source=user_profile---------100----------------------------	EmptySummary					As Muslim families across America and around the world celebrate the beginning of Ramadan, Jill and I want to extend our best wishes to all who are observing this holy month.Americans of all backgrounds have come to respect the discipline and values of Ramadan.

MEJB234202097	Joe Biden	2020-04-23	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Latest Unemployment Filing Numbers	Today, we learned that another 4.4 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing the total number of Americans filing new unemployment claims to 26 million since this crisis started, with many more feeling the direct economic impact of this pandemic. These aren’t just overwhelming numbers or aggregate statistics , every one is a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, a community worried about how it will recover. Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis , and Donald Trump isn’t doing enough for them. Congress gave President Trump the tools to keep people on payroll in the CARES Act, but he hasn’t fully used them. Instead of standing by while the economy sheds millions of jobs each week during this pandemic, Trump should be working around the clock to keep as many people as possible attached to their jobs. That’s what I would be doing if I were in the Oval Office right now. I would be doing everything in my power to expand short-time compensation programs for workers. I like to call it “employment insurance.” So for example, if a company has to make cutbacks,, instead of laying people off, its employees would remain employed but working reduced hours. The federal government would cover the difference for the duration of the crisis. Those workers stay on the job and their lost wages are replaced. Workers making median wages remain financially whole. And businesses don’t lose money by keeping everyone on payroll. The CARES Act created the framework for this, but it requires presidential leadership to execute. Trump hasn’t done anything discernible to make this happen. Instead, the entirely predictable has occurred: state unemployment systems are being stretched beyond capacity, and workers are anxiously waiting for their checks as the bills pile up. In Florida, as of this week, only 15 percent of unemployment claims were being paid. 15 percent. That’s so disgraceful, it doesn’t even approach a failing grade. Every Florida worker who has lost their job needs to be made financially whole for the duration of this crisis. Leadership means taking responsibility , not just credit , especially when things are hard. It’s time for President Trump to step up. The livelihoods and futures of millions of Americans depend on it.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-latest-unemployment-filing-numbers-dd4c383a3395?source=user_profile---------101----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, we learned that another 4.4 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing the total number of Americans filing new unemployment claims to 26 million since this crisis started, with many more feeling the direct economic impact of this pandemic.

MEJB244202095	Joe Biden	2020-04-24	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day	Today we remember the atrocities faced by the Armenian people in the Metz Yeghern , the Armenian Genocide. From 1915 to 1923, almost 2 million Armenians were deported en mass, and 1.5 million men, women, and children were killed. Greeks, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were also targeted. We must never forget or remain silent about this horrific and systematic campaign of extermination. And we will forever respect the perseverance of the Armenian people in the wake of such tragedy.It is particularly important to speak these words and commemorate this history at a moment when we are reminded daily of the power of truth, and of our shared responsibility to stand against hate , because silence is complicity. If we do not fully acknowledge, commemorate, and teach our children about genocide, the words “never again” lose their meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy. Failing to remember or acknowledge the fact of a genocide only paves the way for future mass atrocities.During my years in the Senate, I was proud to lead efforts to recognize the genocide against the Armenian people. Last year, I was pleased to endorse bipartisan legislation in the House and Senate that officially recognized and established an ongoing U.S. commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. If elected, I pledge to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and will make universal human rights a top priority for my administration.I stand today with all Armenians and the Armenian-American community, which has contributed so much to our nation, in remembering and honoring the victims of the Armenian Genocide.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-armenian-genocide-remembrance-day-78500cb4dd1c?source=user_profile---------99----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today we remember the atrocities faced by the Armenian people in the Metz Yeghern , the Armenian Genocide. From 1915 to 1923, almost 2 million Armenians were deported en mass, and 1.5 million men, women, and children were killed. Greeks, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians were also targeted. We must never forget or remain silent about this horrific and systematic campaign of extermination. And we will forever respect the perseverance of the Armenian people in the wake of such tragedy.It is particularly important to speak these words and commemorate this history at a moment when we are reminded daily of the power of truth, and of our shared responsibility to stand against hate , because silence is complicity. If we do not fully acknowledge, commemorate, and teach our children about genocide, the words 'never again' lose their meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy. Failing to remember or acknowledge the fact of a genocide only paves the way for future mass atrocities.During my years in the Senate, I was proud to lead efforts to recognize the genocide against the Armenian people. Last year, I was pleased to endorse bipartisan legislation in the House and Senate that officially recognized and established an ongoing U.S. commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. If elected, I pledge to support a resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide and will make universal human rights a top priority for my administration.I stand today with all Armenians and the Armenian-American community, which has contributed so much to our nation, in remembering and honoring the victims of the Armenian Genocide.
MEJB274202093	Joe Biden	2020-04-27	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Safeguarding our Faith-Based Communities	One year ago, a gunman armed with an AR-15 style rifle and multiple magazines entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, where members of the Jewish community were gathered to mark Shabbat and celebrate the last day of Passover. He murdered one and injured three others before fleeing the scene, with more casualties prevented thanks to the bravery of a congregation member and the weapon jamming.Sadly, the incident was just one in a long and too-rapidly increasing line of attacks targeting communities of faith all across the country. Poway, Pittsburgh, and Monsey, New York, are now part of a tragic shorthand for anti-Semitic violence targeting synagogues and Jewish faith observances , but churches, mosques, Sikh temples, and other houses of worship have seen tragic acts of violence as well: Mother Emanuel in South Carolina, First Baptist Church and West Freeway Church of Christ in Texas, Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Minnesota, and many others.Hatred is not a new phenomenon. Nor is it a problem only in the United States. We have recently passed the annual day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust, as well as the one-year anniversary of the horrific massacre at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. So it falls to all of us to remain vigilant against these threats, to call out these evils for what they are, and to fight against them at every turn.These are acts of terrorism, plain and simple. They are bound together by the common thread of perpetrators using fear and violence to undermine individuals’ ability to freely exercise their faith. With morbid regularity, these attacks steal lives, destroy families, and wound the communities from which many draw strength. They are an assault on our shared American values of inclusivity, tolerance, and respect.In response to these threats, religious communities have leaned on regional initiatives and member donations to finance enhanced security measures. Federal and state security grants have also helped to improve emergency preparedness and physical security infrastructure. While these are steps in the right direction, more is needed. Religious freedom means the right to practice one’s faith without fear.Addressing gun violence across our nation is a critical part of this, and I have vowed to take the fight to the NRA and the gun manufacturers and to enact a comprehensive plan of gun safety reforms as president. Today, I am also releasing a plan specifically to help safeguard faith-based communities across the United States.These policy proposals are crucial to protecting our faith-based communities against the ugly rise of hate and extremism that has gained encouragement and political cover under the Trump Administration. Anti-Semitism has increased markedly, with hate crimes and anti-Semitic assaults and incidents spiking over the last several years. Government officials are sounding the alarm over a dangerous rise in anti-religious hate speech and conspiracy theories that have taken root in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. It is dangerous, and we need a leader who will send a clear message from the very top of government that hate has no safe harbor in the United States of America. Time and again, Donald Trump has failed to meet that simple test. He has fanned the flames of bigotry and racism for political gain, and made a moral equivalence between those perpetuating hate in our country, and those standing against it.As president, I will fight to restore the soul of this nation and defend our most sacred American values. Freedom of religion was at the heart of the founding of our nation. It is the protection that says each of us is free to live according to our own conscience. During moments of crisis, that freedom is more important than ever.For so many of us, it is our faith that sees us through times of trouble and that urges us to rise each morning and go forth into the world. My faith has given me refuge and resurgence throughout my life. And, with the world struggling now to overcome this pandemic, the ability to practice our respective faiths is a much-needed source of solace for people everywhere. This year, we cannot gather for Ramadan prayers. We could not join together for Passover services or Easter celebrations, or any other religious ceremonies , but we are still united with our communities by our faith. And when we defeat this virus and can gather together once more, we must do everything in our power to assure that we can all celebrate our faith, safely and without fear.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-safeguarding-our-faith-based-communities-14cb72441ebf?source=user_profile---------97----------------------------	EmptySummary					One year ago, a gunman armed with an AR-15 style rifle and multiple magazines entered the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, where members of the Jewish community were gathered to mark Shabbat and celebrate the last day of Passover.

MEJB274202094	Joe Biden	2020-04-27	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden and the Biden for President Public Health Advisory Committee on Testing	We all agree on the need to reopen the economy and allow some semblance of normalcy as soon as possible. The economic pain and suffering are simply too great to delay unnecessarily. But it is wrong to talk about “choosing” between our public health and our economy. That’s a false choice. If we don’t beat the virus, we will never get back to full economic strength. And the experience of other nations and past pandemics is teaching us that we have to be prepared for a resurgence of cases that could once again stretch the capacity of our health care system and threaten lives. Public health experts agree there are several keys to safely re-opening the economy and rebuilding the confidence of the American people in their government’s ability to protect them. We need to boost the capacity of our health care system and better protect our health care workers by ramping up the production , and ensuring the fair distribution , of critical equipment like masks and other personal protective equipment, as the Biden for President campaign has repeatedly called for. We need to test and trace contacts of people who have been infected with COVID-19. And we need clear guidance, oversight, and resources for workplaces to keep employees as safe as possible. Are those elements in place? What will it take to put them in place? So far, the United States has conducted 5 million COVID-19 tests for our population of 330 million people. In recent days the number of tests has climbed, but no one who has studied the facts thinks this is sufficient. We are still seeing a massive shortfall and extensive disparities between states in testing , that’s unacceptable. And those failures are in no small part due to the federal government mishandling and delaying the pandemic response. We are now several months into this crisis, and this administration refuses to own up to the original sin of its failed response , the failure to test. Failed leadership, bureaucracy, and a lack of urgency have slowed the testing production process and continue to put us behind nations like Italy, Canada, and Germany in terms of per capita testing. Last week, we marked the deaths of 50,000 people from COVID-19 in the United States , each one a life cut tragically short. Our nation is now the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic with more known cases than any other nation in the world. This isn’t rocket science. It just takes investment and execution , both of which have been gravely lacking. Vice President Biden has repeatedly called for President Trump to stand up a Pandemic Testing Board, just as FDR created a War Production Board to massively scale up the production and allocation of equipment and supplies we needed to fight and win World War II. The Board should have members from the public and private sectors , and involve state and local leaders, too. It would oversee a nationwide campaign to provide both diagnostic and antibody tests, which includes surging the production of test kits and lab supplies; coordinating the distribution to every state, tribe, and territory; identifying testing sites and sufficient trained personnel to staff them; ensuring adequate lab capacity and the swift reporting of results; and providing clear guidance on who needs a test. A nationwide campaign has to be well-coordinated and highly agile , able to adjust quickly to accommodate new scientific developments or respond to sudden bottlenecks by evaluating a variety of approaches, from rapid point-of-care tests to in-home sample collection, as Seattle has done. We should better utilize our great university and medical school research laboratories, which spent precious resources equipping their facilities to run COVID-19 tests, yet now sit idle. Let’s harness that capacity to help drastically ramp up our capacity to process these tests And we shouldn’t just test more, we should test smarter. Right now, because of shortages of tests and personnel protective equipment and related challenges, we are still only largely testing the sickest people we suspect have COVID-19, so they can be isolated and cared for. Smart testing would focus on individuals who are at heightened risk, like nursing home residents, as well as those who interact with many people each day, including health care workers, grocery store workers, public safety officials, public transportation employees, and others. Time is not on our side. It is urgent we get these pieces in place and functioning smoothly at full capacity before flu season arrives in the fall, when experts say we could experience a second wave of COVID-19 cases. Testing alone is not enough. We also need Apollo-like moonshots to develop and deploy proven therapeutics and vaccines globally if we are ever to gain the upper hand on this virus. We cannot allow this administration to repeat its failure on testing with therapeutics and vaccines. We must let science , not politicians , lead. We should set the goal of identifying safe, effective therapeutics within 100 days by building on long-standing, proven clinical trial networks , which helped save millions of lives in the fight against AIDS , with a new enduring Emerging Infectious Disease Clinical Trial Network and equipping it with every resource at our disposal. Instead of having different studies competing with each other for resources and patients, this new clinical trial network would bring scientific talent together behind the most promising drugs. And, we should be working now to accelerate a coordinated global approach to develop a safe, effective vaccine and the manufacturing capacity for the doses and related materials like syringes that we will need at home and around the world. The only way to stop COVID-19 here, is to stop it everywhere. In the meantime, however, testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could make this happen. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s pushed sole responsibility to governors, while telling them to fly blind without the critical data we derive from testing. If the Biden Administration were in office today, it would have prioritized this testing issue months ago. Since the Trump Administration both can’t and won’t, Congress should step in and establish the Pandemic Testing Board, giving it the authority and funding it needs to succeed. Once we identify COVID-19 infected people, we need to isolate them and identify those to whom they might have unwittingly spread the disease. This is called contact tracing, and our public health professionals do it every day to halt the transmission of infectious diseases already in our midst, including for tuberculosis and measles. To battle a pandemic as large as COVID-19, it will require not just new privacy-protecting technology, but also trained people. Through tough times in our past, generations of Americans have stood up and selflessly answered the call to serve their fellow citizens. We need to harness this spirit of empathy, decency, and unity today and form a new U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps of at least 100,000 people to mobilize Americans across the country, including AmeriCorps and Peace Corps Volunteers and those laid off by the crisis. Massachusetts has already launched its own. The U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps could serve in a variety of important functions, including ensuring contact tracing reaches every underserved community in America , ideally by members of those communities themselves. Already the data shows these communities are being left behind, even as they are suffering the brunt of the pandemic. Perhaps even more importantly, the U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps would become the permanent foundation for a stronger national community public health service that could eventually transition to fight the opioid epidemic and address other national public health priorities. Finally, we need to be working right now on the conditions under which the private sector, industry by industry, can reopen safely. During the H1N1 epidemic, the Obama-Biden Administration tasked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Disease Control with issuing detailed guidance for how employers should protect their workers. Then OSHA enforced the law based on those guidelines. And it didn’t stop there. After the epidemic, it spent years preparing for the next one with a comprehensive and specific permanent infectious disease standard that would have required health facilities and certain other high exposure workplaces to permanently implement infection control programs to protect their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration handed this standard to the Trump Administration, but instead of moving it to rulemaking, the Trump Administration shelved it. Today, the Trump Administration is still not driving a serious enforcement effort, putting the health and safety of workers at risk every day. We should immediately double the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards and guidelines, release and enforce an Emergency Temporary Standard to give employers and employees more comprehensive and specific guidance on what to do to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and get to work bringing a permanent standard to conclusion and expanding it to include all relevant workplaces, from manufacturing plants to grocery stores. We want our country to get moving and healthy again. But we must take the necessary, rational steps, grounded in science, to do so safely, so COVID-19 doesn’t come roaring back, shredding our still-fragile health care system and the green shoots of an economic reopening. Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president. It’s time for him to take responsibility and act like one.

MEJB15202091	Joe Biden	2020-05-01	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden	April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief , that women should be heard , was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country , but how far we still have to go.When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn’t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture.So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women , and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation , and passed the law.In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.As Vice President, we started the “It’s on Us” campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence , and against the law.We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That’s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too , they couldn’t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them , they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity.In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we’re not done yet.It’s on us, and it’s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.They aren’t true. This never happened.While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.But this much bears emphasizing.She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They , both men and a woman , have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one , not one , who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way , as indeed I would not have.There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills.There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be , the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women’s health issues and basic women’s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women’s voices are heard.We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence.We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color.We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority.I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I’m committed to finishing the job.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012?source=user_profile---------95----------------------------	EmptySummary					April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

Both of those things happened.As Vice President, we started the 'It's on Us' campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence , and against the law.We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That's why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too , they couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening around them , they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity.In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we're not done yet.It's on us, and it's on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.They aren't true. This never happened.While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.But this much bears emphasizing.She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They , both men and a woman , have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one , not one , who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way , as indeed I would not have.There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills.There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be , the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.As a Presidential candidate, I'm accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn't think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That's not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women's health issues and basic women's rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women's voices are heard.We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence.We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color.We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority.I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I'm committed to finishing the job.
MEJB15202092	Joe Biden	2020-05-01	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today’s Unemployment Claims	Once more, millions of Americans filed new unemployment claims last week , 3.8 million more individuals off payroll. More than 30 million Americans have now lost their jobs since this pandemic seized our nation. This shocks the conscience of every American. It’s a national economic disaster. The Trump administration’s economic response has been a disaster too. They’ve done exactly what we feared from the beginning: bailed out the wealthy and well-connected while leaving worthy small businesses out in the cold. A publicly-traded real-estate trust that owns a Ritz Carlton got $38 million in the initial round of “small business” funding. Meanwhile, the Center for Responsible Lending estimates that more than 90 percent of small businesses owned by people of color will get nothing. Outrageous? Yes. Surprising? No. These are the latest damning signs of Donald Trump’s manifest incompetence. Millions upon millions of Americans are suffering economically, there are more than a million confirmed COVID-19 cases nationwide, and we have now lost more American lives to this virus in just a few weeks than we did in all 20 years of the Vietnam War. One of the hardest parts of this tragedy is knowing beyond a doubt that it didn’t have to be this way. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately , all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president. This week we learned that the intelligence community sent warning after warning to Trump in the President’s Daily Brief , more than a dozen red-alarms in the vital months of January and February. That’s the pace of alarm often used for an imminent terrorist attack. So either Trump didn’t read his PDB, which is inexcusable, or worse, he knew this was a threat and he made a conscious choice to ignore the warnings, downplay the threat, and endanger thousands of American lives and millions of jobs. We should have been using January and February to prepare ourselves, to put in place a plan for testing and containment so we wouldn’t have to resort to these extreme social distancing measures that have put our economy into a free fall. Trump didn’t do that, and now we’re all paying the price.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-todays-unemployment-claims-f38312402ead?source=user_profile---------96----------------------------	EmptySummary					Once more, millions of Americans filed new unemployment claims last week , 3.8 million more individuals off payroll.

MEJB35202090	Joe Biden	2020-05-03	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on World Press Freedom Day	Today is World Press Freedom Day , a day to recognize the vital importance of journalism to upholding free and open democracies, both here at home and around the world. It’s also a day to honor the journalists who dedicate their lives to advancing media freedom, at times braving immense pressure, sacrificing their livelihood or liberty, or even facing mortal danger to bring the truth to light.The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that in 2019, at least 25 journalists around the world were killed while doing their jobs, at least 10 of whom were murdered for their work. Reporters Without Borders tells us that at least 360 people worldwide are currently imprisoned for their work in journalism.We all stand in solidarity with these journalists for, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1786, “Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.”A free press is essential to a free society. Tyrants know this all too well. That is why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook. And, it’s why Donald Trump’s repeated efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path. When he labels the press as the “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE” or decries “FAKE NEWS,” he is eroding our essential, Constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press in ways large and small.Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies and berates individual members of the press, rather than take responsibility for his failures of leadership. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of fact-based reporting violate our core American values and threaten our very system of government. And, it is particularly offensive to see the White House seek to spread misinformation and bully reporters in the midst of a global pandemic.Journalists hold those in positions of authority accountable, investigate and document abuses of power, and expose the truth for everyone to see. While many presidents have been unhappy with their media coverage, only Donald Trump has attacked the independence of journalists and launched an all-out assault on the media.As President, I will restore a relationship with the independent press that is grounded in mutual respect, even , and especially when , they critique policies or positions of my administration. In a Biden White House, there will be no bullying of the media from the press room podium or by tweet. We will have regular, fact-based briefings across my Administration’s major departments and agencies. We must return to civility and transparency in America’s civic discourse.On this World Press Freedom Day, in the face of rising authoritarianism overseas and previously unthinkable peril to our own democracy, support for media freedom matters more than ever.

MEJB45202089	Joe Biden	2020-05-04	Lift Every Voice: The Biden Plan for Black America	Among the greatest honors of my life was a trip I took to Memphis in October of 2018 to visit the National Civil Rights Museum and receive the institution’s annual Freedom Award. While I was there, I had a chance to stand on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was assassinated half a century earlier, and reflect on all of the progress we’d made , and that which we hadn’t , in the years since that unbearable day.The motel balcony leads back into Dr. King’s room , a room preserved just as it was on the night he was taken from us. The bed is unmade. Coffee cups are scattered on the table. There is a restless spirit in that room , of a dream deferred; of unfinished business.The night before Dr. King was assassinated, he stood at the pulpit at Mason Temple and delivered what turned out to be his final sermon , a call to support sanitation workers who were striking for better pay. He commanded the congregation: “Let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.”Fifty-two years later, his charge remains as vital as it was that night. We have made extraordinary strides along so many fronts , but for African American families, we have not yet made America what it ought to be. The truth is, African Americans can never have a fair shot at the American Dream so long as entrenched disparities are still allowed to chip away at opportunity. You don’t have an equal chance when your schools are substandard, when your home is undervalued, when your car insurance costs more for no good reason, or when the poverty rate for African Americans is more than twice what it is for whites.I believe that the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. That goal has always been the core of my candidacy , it’s the very reason that I am running for President. And achieving it starts by rooting out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, our institutions, and our hearts.This mission is more urgent now than ever before, as the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exposed , and cruelly exacerbated , the disparities long faced by African Americans. In April, I called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect more data that would shed light on how COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting communities, including breaking down its impacts by race. The data we’ve seen so far suggests that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a far higher rate than whites. African Americans represent an especially high percentage of the front-line workers putting themselves at greater risk to sustain the economy and keep the rest of the country safe and fed , and are less likely to have a job they can do from home, forcing them to make the difficult choice between their health and a paycheck. Long-standing systemic inequalities may also be contributing to this disparity , including the fact that African Americans are more likely to be uninsured. While there’s a lot we don’t yet know about COVID-19, we do know that equitable distribution of resources , like testing and medical equipment , can make a difference in fighting the virus. We must make that a priority and take action now.The virus is also having a disproportionate economic impact on African American families. African American small businesses have been hit hard, and over 90% of African American-owned businesses are estimated to be shut out of the initial relief program due to preexisting, systemic disparities in lending. This is especially dire given that African American families have less of a financial cushion to fall back on in hard times. Since the onset of this crisis, I have been calling for the nation’s relief and recovery efforts to be equitable and just, including by designing relief programs in ways that steer clear of methods we know lead to disparate outcomes , so that funds can actually reach African American families, communities, and small businesses. Unfortunately, Donald Trump has failed to listen or act. If I were President today, I would make it a top priority to ensure that African American workers, families, and small businesses got the relief they need and deserve.This is not a new priority for me , tackling systemic racism and fighting for civil rights is what brought me to public service as a local councilman in the years just after Dr. King’s death, and it has been a driving force throughout my career ever since. I was proud to fight against discriminatory school district funding and housing practices in my own community as a young man , and prouder still of the work I did in the U.S. Senate, co-sponsoring the Civil Rights Act of 1990 to protect against employment discrimination, leading efforts to reauthorize and extend the Fair Housing Act, and spearheading multiple reauthorizations of the Voting Rights Act to protect African Americans’ right to vote.This moment demands an overwhelming moral response. We need a comprehensive agenda for African Americans , a plan with the ambition to match the scale of the challenge, and one that recognizes that race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities.Today, I’m releasing a new plan to achieve equity for the African American community and take us one step closer to making America what it ought to be. The six pillars of my plan are as follows:This plan will tackle some of the most stubborn and pervasive issues , including those that often go unnoticed , that hold back African Americans from receiving an equal shot.African American entrepreneurs seeking capital are rejected at a rate nearly 20 percent higher than white entrepreneurs, and receive far less support when they do get funding. We’re going to fix that by doubling the State Small Business Credit Initiative, doubling funding for a program that supports mission-driven lenders in low-income communities, expanding the New Markets Tax Credit to draw tens of billions of dollars to invest in communities that need it, and shoring up the Small Business Administration’s budget and expanding the agency’s programs that have proven most effective at helping African American-owned businesses get off the ground.The first installment of the Paycheck Protection Program created in response to COVID-19 largely left out minority-owned businesses. We’re going to fix that by providing entrepreneurs with technical assistance and legal and accounting support to ensure that they can apply for funding, producing a weekly dashboard to track exactly which businesses are receiving economic relief, and reserving half of all new relief funds for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees , a category that includes 98 percent of all minority- and women-owned businesses.The gap between African American and white homeownership is larger today than it was when the Fair Housing Act was first passed in 1968 , a key contributor to the unacceptable racial wealth gap that persists between American households. We’re going to fix that by investing $640 billion over ten years to ensure that every American has access to housing that is affordable and accessible, stable and safe, energy-efficient, and located near good schools. We’ll create a tax credit of up to $15,000 for first-time homebuyers available at the moment they make their purchase, establish a new homeowners’ and renters’ bill of rights to bar deceptive and discriminatory practices and bring more accountability and oversight to mortgage brokers and landlords, end discrimination in credit reporting by creating a new public credit reporting agency to catch and eliminate racial disparities, and establish national standards for housing appraisals to put an end to the undervaluing of homes in African American neighborhoods.The typical African American family holds about one-tenth the wealth of a typical white family , and the disparity has grown worse, not better, over the last fifty years. We’re going to fix that by implementing Congressman Jim Clyburn’s “10–20–30” Plan to ensure that federal programs are reaching persistently impoverished communities, and targeting new green infrastructure projects , and the good-paying jobs that come with them , to historically marginalized neighborhoods. In conjunction with that work, we’ll expand on the Obama-Biden Administration’s efforts to increase federal and state contracting opportunities for African American-owned businesses , including by increasing funds for the Minority Business Development Agency and expanding the work of its landmark Federal Procurement Center. We’ll also close the digital divide by investing $20 billion in broadband infrastructure to reach underserved communities and passing the Digital Equity Act. And we’ll make it easier for African Americans to retire with dignity by revamping employer retirement plans and putting them within reach of far more workers , and by making Social Security benefits more generous and equitable.For too long, African Americans have not been adequately dealt into the middle class. We’re going to fix that by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and ending unequal pay, getting our essential workers the pay, protections, and dignity they deserve, strengthening public and private sector unions, and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We’ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for every three- and four-year old in America, so that every child gets off to a good start , and close the funding gap between white and non-white school districts to ensure that African American families can thrive across generations. We’ll tackle the student debt crisis , which disproportionately burdens African Americans , make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families with incomes below $125,000, and invest more than $70 billion in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions to equip the next generation of African American professionals to succeed.There is much, much more to my plan , after all, the roots of inequity are sprawling, and touch nearly every corner of American policy and society. We need to take serious steps to reduce racial health disparities, and we need to put an end to forces that profit off of our criminal justice system. We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, and we need to ensure that every community has access to safe drinking water. Building a more equitable nation will require a broad and coordinated push across the full scope of our government and society , but it can, and must, be done.I encourage you to read the full details of my plan here. And I look forward to making it a reality with the help of lawmakers, community leaders, and families across the country who aspire to the dream of Dr. King. In his words: “Let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America what it ought to be.”	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/lift-every-voice-the-biden-plan-for-black-america-d546228da188?source=user_profile---------93----------------------------	EmptySummary					Among the greatest honors of my life was a trip I took to Memphis in October of 2018 to visit the National Civil Rights Museum and receive the institution's annual Freedom Award.

MEJB55202088	Joe Biden	2020-05-05	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Asian Pacific American Heritage Month	May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, a time to celebrate and reflect on the boundless contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders to our national life.From the earliest days of our history, the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community has been a central part of our shared American story. Across the generations, AAPIs have strengthened our communities, built our cities, sparked progress, brought life to our fields and farmlands, and served courageously in our armed forces.This year, however, we mark Asian Pacific American Heritage Month at a fraught time for AAPI communities, our nation, and the world. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it a rash of racist messages, verbal and physical attacks, and other incidents of hate directed against AAPIs. Such assaults strike at the heart of our country , all the more so at a time when so many AAPIs are leading on the front lines of this crisis as nurses and doctors, researchers and scientists, delivery drivers and retail workers, and in so many other essential roles.With a White House devoid of moral authority, and a President who chooses time and again to fan the flames of hate, it is more critical than ever that all Americans stand together strongly against racism and xenophobia. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to reject hateful rhetoric , whatever its source , and speak up for the common humanity, and equal place in the American fabric, of our AAPI neighbors and friends.Our diversity is and always has been the defining strength of our nation; in each generation, our spirit and our ambitions have been renewed by wave after wave of immigrants seeking out the American dream. I was proud to serve as Vice President in the most diverse administration in United States history, working with President Obama to expand opportunity through the reestablished White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders; secure health insurance for two million AAPIs through the Affordable Care Act; protect thousands of AAPI DREAMers growing up in America; provide long overdue compensation to Filipino veterans of World War II; and appoint more AAPI judges to the bench than all prior administrations combined. I look forward to furthering that progress as President , and to ensuring that our White House and federal government once again reflect the full diversity of the AAPI community and our country as a whole.Until then, Jill and I extend our best wishes to AAPI communities across America, and look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-asian-pacific-american-heritage-month-974a10b0bd17?source=user_profile---------92----------------------------	EmptySummary					May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, a time to celebrate and reflect on the boundless contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders to our national life.From the earliest days of our history, the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community has been a central part of our shared American story.

MEJB65202086	Joe Biden	2020-05-06	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Filing of the Opening Briefs in California v. Texas	Today in our country, more than 1.2 million people have been infected with COVID-19. More than 71,000 lives have been lost to this pandemic. And millions more are facing enormous economic instability due to lost jobs, cut hours, reduced wages, and the ever-present fear of what they will do if they or their loved ones fall ill and need expensive medical treatment.Against this backdrop of national crisis and human tragedy, today marks the beginning of the process of parties filing briefings with the U.S. Supreme Court in the Trump-backed lawsuit to strip away health care protections for the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). By siding with the Republican Attorneys-General who are seeking to invalidate the ACA in the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump has made clear where his priorities lie. Not with protecting the millions of people who depend on the exchanges for their health coverage. Not with ensuring that more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions won’t be denied coverage or charged more by their insurers. Not with the thousands of Americans who may develop new “pre-existing conditions” due to their battle with COVID-19. Not with the young people who can now stay on their parents insurance until 26. Not with women, who will no longer be protected against being charged more for their insurance. No , Trump has decided he’d rather destroy President Obama’s legacy than protect the health care of millions upon millions of Americans. He’d rather look after the profits of the insurance industry than make sure people can access healthcare in their hour of need. It’s despicable. The number one job of any president is to keep the American people safe. Trump’s failures to heed the warnings that he was given to prepare for and protect against the worst impacts of the coronavirus are already nothing less than a dereliction of duty. Today’s efforts to destroy every aspect of the ACA are yet another horrifying example of Trump’s callous disregard for the struggles of everyday people all across the country. If Trump and the Republicans get their way, it will mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. We must not allow that to happen.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-filing-of-the-opening-briefs-in-california-v-texas-b2ae15e3b0f5?source=user_profile---------90----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today in our country, more than 1.2 million people have been infected with COVID-19.

MEJB75202083	Joe Biden	2020-05-07	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Birth Control Case Before the U.S. Supreme Court	In the midst of a devastating public health and economic crisis, Donald Trump is once again doubling down on his quest to strip away women’s access to basic health care. Every woman’s health care choices should be between her and her doctor , that’s why, when Obamacare became the law of the land, it required insurance plans to cover contraceptive care free of charge to the consumer. That landmark victory extended vital coverage to over 60 million women , including at least 32 million women of color. The Obama-Biden Administration provided an exemption for houses of worship, and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions. The accommodation allowed women working at these nonprofit organizations to access contraceptive coverage not through their employer-provided plan, but instead through their insurance company or a third-party administrator.The Trump Administration has done everything in its power to erode that critical progress and deny women access to the full scope of health care. And if that weren’t bad enough, Donald Trump is also actively working in the courts to take us back to a time when insurers could discriminate against Americans based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and HIV status , and shamelessly fighting to end protections for people living with preexisting conditions such as asthma, cancer, and diabetes.As President, I will reverse President Trump’s rollbacks of the Affordable Care Act, including his efforts to deny women access to health care, and work to restore the Obama-Biden policy that was in place before the U.S. Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision. We should be expanding, not diminishing, access to health care , especially in the midst of a health crisis.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-birth-control-case-before-the-u-s-supreme-court-fe16addb28d4?source=user_profile---------87----------------------------	EmptySummary					In the midst of a devastating public health and economic crisis, Donald Trump is once again doubling down on his quest to strip away women's access to basic health care.

MEJB75202084	Joe Biden	2020-05-07	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today’s Unemployment Claims	This morning, we learned that over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March , one out of every five American workers. As bad as that is, the figures don’t come close to measuring the real human toll of the current crisis: one out of every five children in America are not getting enough to eat. Small businesses that to so many were their piece of the American Dream are closing and won’t reopen. Many more have lost their jobs or had their hours slashed and have been unable to successfully navigate the unemployment system. And, most tragically, our country has lost more than 74,000 people to the pandemic to date. This is the cost of complacency.President Trump had months to take action and stave off the worst of this crisis; he should have been deploying tests, marshaling medical supplies, and bracing the public to slow the spread from the minute he was briefed on its dangers this winter. He chose instead to dismiss the experts and knowingly make false promises about our testing capacity and the trajectory of the virus. Even as we grieve for all we’ve lost, our most urgent task now is to get help to everyone who needs it , efficiently, equitably, and immediately.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-todays-unemployment-claims-1d13789de43e?source=user_profile---------88----------------------------	EmptySummary					This morning, we learned that over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March , one out of every five American workers.

MEJB75202085	Joe Biden	2020-05-07	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Trump Administration Rule to Undermine Title IX and Campus Safety	Survivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. Today, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump published a rule that flies in the face of that belief and guarantees that college campuses will be less safe for our nation’s young people.Simply put: this new rule gives colleges a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their rights. It lets colleges off the hook for protecting students, by permitting them to choose to investigate only more extreme acts of violence and harassment and requiring them to investigate in a way that dissuades survivors from coming forward.This rule fundamentally disregards student’s civil rights under Title IX, which has helped pave the way for millions of women to access education. Survivors and advocates have fought to hold schools accountable and give young people truly fair access to education. Today’s rule rolls back the clock and reverses those hard-fought victories.Our young people deserve better. During the Obama-Biden Administration, I traveled to the University of New Hampshire , a school with one of the best programs to prevent sexual assault in the nation , to announce that colleges would have new guidance and support from our Administration on how best to prevent and respond to campus sexual assault.With that encouragement , and the It’s On Us campaign that President Obama and I launched , schools took great steps towards leveling the playing field for survivors and accused students. Working with survivors and advocates, we helped to bring this violence out of the shadows and required schools change their practices.Now, Trump’s Education Department , led by Betsy DeVos , is trying to shame and silence survivors, and take away parents’ peace of mind. It’s wrong. And, it will be put to a quick end in January 2021, because as President, I’ll be right where I always have been throughout my career , on the side of survivors, who deserve to have their voices heard, their claims taken seriously and investigated, and their rights upheld.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-trump-administration-rule-to-undermine-title-ix-and-e5dbc545daa?source=user_profile---------89----------------------------	EmptySummary					Survivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced.

MEJB95202081	Joe Biden	2020-05-09	Statement by Vice President Biden	I know that we have been inundated with tragedy these past several months. But I wanted to take a moment to address one particular tragedy, a grave injustice that claimed one life but that resonates in so many others across the thread of our history into the present day.By now, many of us have seen the harrowing footage of Ahmaud Arbery out for a jog on a February day. Shot down in cold blood. Lynched before our very eyes, lynched so plainly, unmistakably and without mercy. He would have turned 26 years old today.His family deserves justice and they deserve it now. They deserve a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his brutal murder. The two men responsible for his death have now been arrested, two-and-a-half months after committing the crime.They were arrested only after Americans saw the footage and spoke out. That shouldn’t be what’s required to get justice in America. Those arrests are just the start of achieving justice, not only for Ahmaud’s family, but for our entire nation. America needs to reckon with this.This vicious act calls to mind the darkest chapters of our history and more recently, the awful specter of white supremacists on the march in Charlottesville, of massacres in houses of worship, of a rising pandemic of hate. Ahmaud should be alive today, we have no recourse for the life he lost.But we can make this promise that together, we will recommit America to equal justice and root out the racial inequities, the gender inequities, and the income-based inequities within our system.African American mothers and fathers should feel confident that their children are safe walking on the streets of America. Until we get there the work remains urgent and unfinished.That is the promise I make to all of you as President, I will work tirelessly to get us to that day.Thank you , and God bless you.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-biden-976d4b051fb4?source=user_profile---------85----------------------------	EmptySummary					I know that we have been inundated with tragedy these past several months.

MEJB95202082	Joe Biden	2020-05-09	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Donald Trump’s Veto of a War Powers Resolution on Iran	The President’s message in vetoing the war powers resolution on Iran demonstrates yet again his contempt for the U.S. Congress as a co-equal branch of government. The war power is shared under our Constitution, for a simple but profound reason: the Framers understood that the solemn decision to take the country to war requires the informed consent of the American people, as expressed through their elected representatives and their President. When I am President, I will work closely with Congress on decisions to use force, not dismiss congressional legislation as “very insulting.”One thing is unmistakably clear: Donald Trump’s policy decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East. Two years ago today, he withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement , a deal that was verifiably blocking Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Back then, he promised us a better deal. He hasn’t delivered. Instead, Iran has ramped up its nuclear enrichment activity, moving them closer to the capacity to develop a nuclear bomb. And Iran has become even more provocative in the region, increasing the danger for American forces stationed in the Middle East.Despite his veto of the congressional joint resolution, Donald Trump should understand this: he does not have the authority to go to war with Iran without Congressional authorization.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-donald-trumps-veto-of-a-war-powers-resolution-on-iran-7993e7246259?source=user_profile---------86----------------------------	EmptySummary					The President's message in vetoing the war powers resolution on Iran demonstrates yet again his contempt for the U.S. Congress as a co-equal branch of government.

MEJB145202079	Joe Biden	2020-05-14	Statement From Vice President Biden	With the recent uptick in violence in Afghanistan, including a horrifying attack this week on a hospital maternity ward, I want to express my concern about the situation facing Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, including the terrorist attack on Sikhs at the Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib in Kabul in March. Sikhs and Hindus are not outsiders living in Afghanistan. They are Afghan, and a vital part of the country’s heritage. The intense persecution these communities have faced in recent decades is an unspeakable tragedy. I vividly recall when, in the mid-1990s, the Taliban sought to make Sikhs and Hindus wear yellow to identify them as non-Muslims. The recent attack against Afghanistan’s Sikh community demonstrates once again the dangerous conditions for religious minorities.The Trump administration has decimated America’s refugee policy and ended our country’s role as the world’s leader in welcoming people fleeing violence and persecution , at a time when refugee numbers and needs are at their highest level since World War II. And, despite its purported commitment to religious freedom, the Administration has used the pandemic as an excuse to suspend refugee admissions and deny the right to seek asylum in the United States. If I am elected President, my administration will renew our commitment to refugees.The United States has a long tradition of offering hope and safe haven to refugees and to those seeking asylum. As a senator, I co-sponsored the legislation creating our refugee program. As President, I will raise the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need.I stand with the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan seeking safety for their families and the freedom to practice their faiths, and urge the Department of State to consider the request for emergency refugee protection.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-from-vice-president-biden-9d7305e5e97e?source=user_profile---------83----------------------------	EmptySummary					With the recent uptick in violence in Afghanistan, including a horrifying attack this week on a hospital maternity ward, I want to express my concern about the situation facing Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, including the terrorist attack on Sikhs at the Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib in Kabul in March.

MEJB145202080	Joe Biden	2020-05-14	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on New Unemployment Insurance Claims	As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment has soared to Great Depression-era levels , with nearly 3 million more people filing new claims for unemployment insurance last week bringing the total to 36.5 million people , we cannot ignore the hard truth: this crisis hit us harder than it needed to, and will take us longer to recover from, because of Donald Trump’s failures. And it has fallen heaviest on middle and working class families , 40 percent of households making less than $40,000 experienced a job loss just in March.We are not the only country that has been hard-hit by this virus. We are not the only country that has experienced stay-at-home orders. We are not the only country that will be forever reshaped in some ways by this crisis. But when you look at where the numbers stand, the difference is clear. Unemployment in the United States is at 14.7 percent and on the rise. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England estimates unemployment will jump to 9 percent. In Australia, it’s 6.2 percent. And in South Korea, which reported its first case of coronavirus on the same day as the United States, unemployment stands at 3.8 percent.It didn’t have to be this way.The difference isn’t the threat the virus posed to any of these countries. The difference is a failure of leadership by our president.Trump failed to take this virus seriously early on, when competent leadership and basic preparation could have saved lives and forestalled the need for draconian social distancing measures.He has failed for three years to focus on the needs of working Americans and to put them in a better position to weather this crisis, instead prioritizing tax cuts for big corporations and focusing on the stock market as the measure of economic success, rather than how well middle class folks were doing.He failed to use the tools Congress gave him to keep millions of workers on the payroll, including the short-time compensation program I’ve been advocating for since mid-April.And now he is failing to make sure that the people who are hurting the most in this crisis , real small business owners, mom and pop shops, women- and minority-owned businesses , are the ones getting the help they need. Instead, he’s overseeing a corrupt recovery where money is going to Trump’s donors, political allies, and companies with Trump-connected lobbyists. Where corporations with connections get concierge service from the banks and Main Street gets left behind again.We deserve a leader who will fight for the ordinary Americans who built this country. That’s what I’ll do as President.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-new-unemployment-insurance-claims-18256a6e32c6?source=user_profile---------84----------------------------	EmptySummary					As the economy continues to spiral downwards and unemployment has soared to Great Depression-era levels , with nearly 3 million more people filing new claims for unemployment insurance last week bringing the total to 36.5 million people , we cannot ignore the hard truth: this crisis hit us harder than it needed to, and will take us longer to recover from, because of Donald Trump's failures.

Where corporations with connections get concierge service from the banks and Main Street gets left behind again.We deserve a leader who will fight for the ordinary Americans who built this country. That's what I'll do as President.
MEJB175202077	Joe Biden	2020-05-17	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden in Honor of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia	Today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies around the world to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Around the globe, including here at home, brave LGBTQ+ activists are fighting for equal protection under the law, freedom from violence, and recognition of their fundamental human rights. The United States should have their backs. We belong at the forefront of this struggle , speaking out, standing strong for our most dearly held values. We should be sending a clear message that bigotry is bigotry, prejudice is prejudice, and hate is hate, no matter where we find it. American leadership must mean moral leadership in the fight for equality for all.The Obama-Biden Administration took unprecedented steps to ensure that our government delivered real progress on the promise of equality, both at home and abroad. From signing the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, to repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” to supporting marriage equality, we fought to advance the civil liberties of LGBTQ+ people in the United States and, for the first time ever, established the advancement of LGBTQ+ equality as a foreign policy goal.Instead of building on this progress, the Trump-Pence Administration has done everything it can to undermine LGBTQ+ rights: giving safe harbor to hate and rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ persons, blocking the ability of transgender individuals to openly serve their country, denying LGBTQ+ people access to critical health care, and failing to address the epidemic of violence against transgender people, among other odious policies. Today, many LGBTQ+ people in the United States live in fear, and LGBTQ+ activists in other countries, who are often fighting desperately for their rights and personal safety, are no longer sure that the United States is their friend and ally.As President, I will reinvigorate and expand U.S. efforts to advance the human rights of LGBTQ+ people at home and around the world. The United States will again be a beacon of hope for people anywhere in the world who suffer violence and discrimination for the simple fact of who they are or who they love. We will strengthen the coalition of countries determined to eliminate discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Anything less would be un-American.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-honor-of-the-international-day-against-homophobia-7a88aab874d7?source=user_profile---------81----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies around the world to celebrate and champion the inherent dignity and worth of all persons, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

MEJB205202075	Joe Biden	2020-05-20	Joe Biden Urges Donald Trump to Address Hunger Crisis	Following yesterday’s town hall with Chef José Andrés, Vice President Biden is calling on President Trump to work with Congress to enact the bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act. As a result of the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis , made worse by President Trump’s failure to act , it is projected that one in six American households will experience food insecurity by the end of this year. Americans are lined up at food banks across the country. At the same time, producers have to dump food that used to go to restaurants, schools, and other big food purchasers, and restaurants are shuttered and laying off workers across the country. The FEED Act is a critical step to address the hunger crisis.Hunger today isn’t about scarcity , it’s about a massive failure in leadership. This moment demands an effective leader who can implement bold solutions, instead of providing false choices. A leader who will harness the restaurant industry to help get food to those who need it, and help get millions of laid-off workers back on the job. Who will bolster food assistance to stimulate the economy. And, who will ensure farmers can get their food to plates and also protect the workers that are essential links in the supply chain.Chef José Andrés is filling this leadership hole created by the White House and, through his non-profit the World Central Kitchen, solving this problem in communities across the country. The Chef’s innovative approach pays restaurants to prepare meals for hungry individuals. This allows restaurants to hire back their employees, keep buying food from producers who would have no other purchaser if restaurants were shuttered, and ensure that people across the country have nutritious food to eat.With a partner in the White House, this strategy can be scaled up nationally. The bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act would temporarily allow the federal government to pay restaurants to prepare meals for the hungry without requiring cash-strapped states to provide any matching dollars.This proposal builds on Vice President Biden’s call for the Trump Administration to support proposals to strengthen food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and ensure access to more nutritious offerings. If Biden was President today, he would increase SNAP benefits by 15% during the deepening recession, and temporarily provide low-income families with about $100 per month in extra nutritional support.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-urges-donald-trump-to-address-hunger-crisis-655009f4f39f?source=user_profile---------79----------------------------	EmptySummary					Following yesterday's town hall with Chef Jos� Andr�s, Vice President Biden is calling on President Trump to work with Congress to enact the bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act.

MEJB225202074	Joe Biden	2020-05-22	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump’s Decision to Withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty	In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership. With the world confronting the health and economic consequences of a global pandemic, the United States should be leading the international community, working with allies, and avoiding destabilizing actions.Withdrawal from Open Skies will have the opposite effect. The Treaty was negotiated and signed under President George H.W. Bush to build confidence and increase transparency in the Euro-Atlantic region. It allows the United States, NATO allies, Russia, and other European countries to fly over each other’s territories and take images to observe military forces and facilities. The transparency it provides is particularly important for countries that do not have their own satellite imaging capabilities.I supported the Open Skies Treaty as a Senator, because I understood that the United States and our allies would benefit from being able to observe , on short notice , what Russia and other countries in Europe were doing with their military forces. That has remained true for the nearly two decades the treaty has been in force. During the Obama Administration, the United States and our partners successfully used Open Skies flights and imagery to support Ukraine when Russia violated its territory, disprove Russian disinformation, and show the world what Russia was doing. The Trump Administration says it is withdrawing from the Treaty because Russia is cheating. There are real concerns that Russia is not complying fully with the Treaty. It has improperly imposed restrictions on overflights over certain regions (Kaliningrad and the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia), to which the United States and other parties have objected. These Russian violations should be addressed not by withdrawing from the Treaty, but by seeking to resolve them through the Treaty’s implementation and dispute mechanism. That is exactly how other disputes over Russian implementation have been resolved, including altitude restrictions over Chechnya.Our allies have made clear they want us to remain in the Treaty, and to work together to address compliance issues with Russia. Without us, the Treaty could crumble. Withdrawal will exacerbate growing tensions between the West and Russia, and increase the risks of miscalculation and conflict. Instead of tearing up treaties that make us and our allies more secure, President Trump should take common sense steps to keep Americans safe. He should remain in the Open Skies Treaty and work with allies to confront and resolve problems regarding Russia’s compliance.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-president-trumps-decision-to-withdraw-from-the-open-606a9668d489?source=user_profile---------78----------------------------	EmptySummary					In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership.

MEJB235202073	Joe Biden	2020-05-23	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Protecting Hong Kong’s Autonomy	For more than three years, President Trump has given Xi Jinping and autocrats around the world a pass on human rights. Trump has repeatedly turned a blind eye to China’s deepening repression in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and throughout China. In fact, just last November, Donald Trump declared that he was “standing with Xi Jinping” on Hong Kong and praised China’s leaders for acting “very responsibly.” Now we see the consequences: leaders in Beijing are proposing a law to further erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the rights of its citizens. It is no surprise China’s government believes it can act with impunity to violate its commitments. The Administration’s protests are too little, too late , and Donald Trump has conspicuously had very little to say. We need to be clear, strong, and consistent on values when it comes to China. That’s what I’ll do as president.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-protecting-hong-kongs-autonomy-f75258af932d?source=user_profile---------77----------------------------	EmptySummary					For more than three years, President Trump has given Xi Jinping and autocrats around the world a pass on human rights.

MEJB285202070	Joe Biden	2020-05-28	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on His Plans for Full Participation and Equality for People with Disabilities	Thirty years ago, thanks to the incredible moral leadership of my friends Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Tony Coelho, and the courage and determination of the disability community, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA was an enormous step forward for our country. It advanced equality and access to public spaces, transportation, government services, and so much more. And it demonstrated that Democrats and Republicans could work together to pass important legislation that made life better for millions of Americans.But 30 years on, the work of ensuring that everyone has access to the tools they need to participate fully in our society isn’t yet finished. That’s why today, I’m releasing a comprehensive plan for people with disabilities to move us closer to full equality.For me, it all comes down to a simple truth: everyone is entitled to a life of dignity and opportunity. That’s my north star. That’s why, from the beginning, I’ve made building a more inclusive and more resilient middle class the cornerstone of my campaign. And this time, we’re going to make sure everyone comes along.Everyone should be able to live independently in their chosen communities, enriching our society with their talents and contributions. Everyone should have access to high-quality, affordable health care, including mental health care. Everyone deserves competitive, integrated employment and educational opportunities.And in a time of pandemic, when people with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to this virus, we must redouble our efforts to ensure they have the resources and the protections they need for their health, well-being and independence.So today, in addition to a comprehensive disability policy, I’m also releasing a COVID-19 specific policy to ensure the needs of people with disabilities are being addressed during this crisis. We need to make sure that health care isn’t rationed and fully enforce non-discrimination protections throughout our recovery. We need to expand home and community-based services, and make sure that caregivers also have access to emergency paid sick leave and financial support.As we recover and rebuild from this crisis, we have a once in a generation opportunity to transform our country. And as we do, we must make sure that disability rights, and expanding opportunities for people with disabilities, is central to our agenda.The disability community must be heard, listened to, and respected, because this is an issue that matters to every American: equality. We can meaningfully expand opportunities for people with disabilities and reverse the real harms that Trump has inflicted.From the very beginning, Trump showed his heartlessness and disrespect for this community when he publicly mocked and degraded a Pulitzer-winning reporter for his disability. It was an appalling moment in our politics, and since then his record has matched his rhetoric. Trump has sought to strip away the protections of Obamacare and gut supports in Medicaid and the Supplemental Security Income that benefit people with disabilities.It’s despicable. And, it’s not who we are.The American people can achieve anything we set our minds to. Ordinary people accomplish extraordinary things everyday, given half a chance , but it’s up to us to make sure that no one is denied their chance, not because of their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, economic status, or zip code , and not because they have a disability.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-his-plans-for-full-participation-and-equality-for-people-6f25bbfbe8ab?source=user_profile---------74----------------------------	EmptySummary					Thirty years ago, thanks to the incredible moral leadership of my friends Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Tony Coelho, and the courage and determination of the disability community, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

MEJB285202071	Joe Biden	2020-05-28	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today’s Unemployment Claims	Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new unemployment claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. This is just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure to do what a president should and must do: lead in a crisis. He ignored the warnings, refused to prepare the country, and wasn’t honest with the American people about what was needed , and we are all living with the horrific results. Now, nearly a quarter of the American workforce has filed for unemployment , a figure so staggering that it would have seemed unthinkable not long ago.Though the coronavirus is to blame for planting the seeds of this damage, we know that Donald Trump’s persistent failure to act is responsible for the tragic and unprecedented scale of the crisis. Trump was warned for months about the urgency of the situation, but sat on his hands , undermining public health experts and spinning false promises to the American people to prop up his political standing at the expense of public safety.Germany, by contrast, had its first reported case of coronavirus almost a week after the United States, but has suffered only a tiny fraction of the unemployment we’ve faced thanks to a swift and effective public health response. Millions more Americans would be employed today , and our lives would have a far greater semblance of normalcy , had Trump responded with similar resolve. A devastating study released last week found that 36,000 people could have been saved had Trump taken action even one week earlier. Instead, more than 100,000 Americans have been lost forever, and the day-to-day lives and future dreams of 40 million people and their families have been thrown off course.Even now, Trump refuses to focus on getting help to those who need it most. The largest single recipient of relief funds intended for small businesses was a hotel executive and major Trump donor who claimed more than $58 million in taxpayer bailout money. A private jet company founded by a Trump donor received another $27 million. And a cell phone location-tracking company that has been hired by the Trump campaign to target voters obtained nearly $3 million.Meanwhile, actual small businesses and mom-and-pop entrepreneurs , the lifeblood of local economies , are being turned away in droves. As if that weren’t enough, Trump has also used the cover of this crisis to brazenly fire five inspectors general, the public watchdogs whose job it is to guard against corruption , including the official responsible for providing oversight of pandemic relief funds.The corruption is obvious , the incompetence even more so. Two months after Congress passed the CARES Act to speed relief to the American people, not one dollar allocated for the Main Street Lending Program , a $600 billion fund designed to help small and medium-sized businesses across America , has been disbursed. Not one dollar, as businesses keep laying workers off and struggle through some of the most brutal months in modern history. Wall Street has gotten the help it needs; Main Street is still waiting. There is no excuse for this Administration’s lack of urgency or care given all that the American people are enduring right now.I oversaw implementation of the nearly $800 billion Recovery Act , with less than 0.2 percent waste, fraud, and abuse. That response didn’t happen by magic. It took sustained focus and constant pressure and personal engagement at the highest levels to make sure we were implementing the program efficiently and effectively on behalf of the American people. We need that type of response right now , albeit on a dramatically larger scale.Donald Trump should be laser-focused on getting relief out as fast as possible to the people who actually need it , with no favoritism and no fraud. That he continues to occupy himself with self-pitying tweets and dangerous conspiracy theories in the face of an ongoing, world-historic crisis killing thousands of Americans each day and putting millions more out of work is beyond comprehension. I pray that the President thinks of them.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-todays-unemployment-claims-e20ceb0e12e0?source=user_profile---------75----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new unemployment claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million.

MEJB295202069	Joe Biden	2020-05-29	My Remarks on George Floyd and the Unfolding Situation in Minnesota	Once again , the words “I can’t breathe.”An act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more black man in America his civil rights and his human rights. It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal.The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd.We’ve spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It’s a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today.Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it’s always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , “I can’t breathe” , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the “appalling silence of the good people.” Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don’t have to imagine it.The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it’s undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people.This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That’s the challenge we face.And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power.

It denied his very humanity. It denied him of his life. Depriving George Floyd , as it deprived Eric Garner , of the one thing every human being must be able to do: Breathe. So simple. So basic. So brutal.The same thing happened with Ahmaud Arbery. The same with Breonna Taylor. The same thing with George Floyd.We've spoken their names aloud. Cried them out in pain and horror. Chiseled them into long suffering hearts. They are the latest additions to an endless list of lives stolen , potential wiped out unnecessarily. It's a list that dates back more than 400 years: black men, black women, black children. The original sin of this country still stains our nation today.Sometimes we manage to overlook it, and just push forward with the thousand other tasks of daily life. But it's always there. And weeks like this, we see it plainly. We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words , 'I can't breathe' , and do nothing. We cannot fall victim to what Martin Luther King called the 'appalling silence of the good people.' Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering , who will be next? Imagine if every time your husband or son, wife or daughter, left the house, you feared for their safety from bad actors and bad police. Imagine if you had to have that talk with your child about not asserting their rights , and taking the abuse handed out to them , just so they could make it home. Imagine having the police called on you , for just sitting in Starbucks or renting an Airbnb or watching birds. That is the norm for black people in this nation , they don't have to imagine it.The anger and the frustration and the exhaustion , it's undeniable. But that is not the promise of America. And it is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all people.This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism. It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. We need real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet , that holds bad cops accountable, and that repairs the relationship between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to protect. And we need to stand up as a nation , with the black community, and with all minority communities , and come together as one America. That's the challenge we face.And it will require those of us who sit in positions of influence to finally deal with the abuse of power. The pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.It is the duty of every American to grapple with it , and grapple with it now.With our complacency, our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence. Nothing about this will be easy or comfortable. But if we simply allow this wound to scab over once more, without treating the underlying injury , we will never truly heal.The very soul of America is at stake. We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. We have to pursue it with real urgency.

MEJB305202068	Joe Biden	2020-05-30	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Today’s Successful SpaceX Launch at Cape Canaveral	Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. When Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a mission to the International Space Station, they added their names to the long list of heroes who have changed the way we think about our universe and our place in it. Their voyage not only marks the return of American astronauts traveling to space from U.S. soil, but a pioneering new phase of public-private cooperation for the peaceful exploration of space. I congratulate NASA, SpaceX, and all the hardworking women and men who made today a victory for American innovation and persistence. This mission represents the culmination of work begun years ago, and which President Obama and I fought hard to ensure would become a reality. We planted the seeds of today’s success during the 2009 Recovery Act, which according to NASA, has saved taxpayers up to $30 billion and invigorated an aerospace industry in Florida that accounts for more than 130,000 jobs in the state. As President, I look forward to advancing America’s commitment to pursuing space exploration and unlocking scientific discoveries that will inspire a new generation of dreamers to gaze up at the sky and imagine all that our future may hold.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-todays-successful-spacex-launch-at-cape-canaveral-e92402fa6310?source=user_profile---------72----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel.

MEJB315202067	Joe Biden	2020-05-31	We are a nation furious at injustice.	These last few days have laid bare that we are a nation furious at injustice. Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd.Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.I know that there are people all across this country who are suffering tonight. Suffering the loss of a loved one to intolerable circumstances, like the Floyd family, or to the virus that is still gripping our nation. Suffering economic hardships, whether due to COVID-19 or entrenched inequalities in our system. And I know that a grief that dark and deep may at times feel too heavy to bear.I know.And I also know that the only way to bear it is to turn all that anguish to purpose. So tonight, I ask all of America to join me , not in denying our pain or covering it over , but using it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.As President, I will help lead this conversation , and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. We must and will get to a place where everyone, regardless of race, believes that “to protect and serve” means to protect and serve them. Only by standing together will we rise stronger than before. More equal, more just, more hopeful , and that much closer to our more perfect union.Please stay safe.

MEJB26202065	Joe Biden	2020-06-02	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania	“I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe.” George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus , and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment , with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in black and brown communities. And they speak to a nation where every day millions of people , not at the moment of losing their life , but in the course of living their life , are saying to themselves, “I can’t breathe.” It’s a wake-up call for our nation. For all of us. And I mean all of us. It’s not the first time we’ve heard these words , they’re the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken six years ago. But it’s time to listen to these words. Understand them. And respond to them , with real action. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together. Leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for too long. But there is no place for violence. No place for looting or destroying property or burning churches, or destroying businesses , many of them built by people of color who for the first time were beginning to realize their dreams and build wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for our police , sworn to protect and serve all people , to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence. We need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protest , and opportunistic violent destruction.And we must be vigilant about the violence that’s being done by the incumbent president to our democracy and to the pursuit of justice. When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the President from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House , using tear gas and flash grenades , in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle. More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that’s what the presidency is: a duty of care , to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday.If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America. Donald Trump isn’t interested in doing that work.Instead he’s preening and sweeping away all the guardrails that have long protected our democracy. Guardrails that have helped make possible this nation’s path to a more perfect union. A union that constantly requires reform and rededication , and yes the protests from voices of those mistreated, ignored, left out and left behind. But it’s a union worth fighting for and that’s why I’m running for President. In addition to the Bible, he might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Mr. President: That is America. Not horses rising up on their hind legs to push back a peaceful protest. Not using the American military to move against the American people. This nation is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is the cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. We will not allow any President to quiet our voice. We won’t let those who see this as an opportunity to sow chaos throw up a smokescreen to distract us from the very real and legitimate grievances at the heart of these protests.And we can’t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing. We can’t. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism. To deal with the growing economic inequality in our nation. And to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation , to so many. I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important , who we want to be. It’s all at stake. That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward. The history of this nation teaches us that it’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. The 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments followed the Civil War. The greatest economy in the history of the world grew out of the Great Depression. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 came in the tracks of Bull Connor’s vicious dogs. To paraphrase Reverend Barber , it’s in the mourning we find hope.It will take more than talk. We’ve had talk before. We’ve had protests before.Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes. That action will not be completed in the first 100 days of my Presidency , or even an entire term. It is the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the first 100 days of my Presidency to get started. A down payment on what is long overdue should come now. Immediately. I call on Congress to act this month on measures that would be a first step in this direction. Starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw choke holds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. There are other measures: to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces, to improve oversight and accountability, to create a model use of force standard , that also should be made law this month. No more excuses. No more delays. If the Senate has time to confirm Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our Constitution, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of “equal protection of the laws.” Looking ahead, in the first 100 days of my presidency, I have committed to creating a national police oversight commission. I’ve long believed we need real community policing. And we need each and every police department in the country to undertake a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, and their de-escalation practices. And the federal government should give them the tools and resources they need to implement reforms. Most cops meet the highest standards of their profession. All the more reason that bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture that allows for these senseless tragedies to keep happening. And we need to learn from the cities and precincts that are getting it right. We know, though, that to have true justice in America, we need economic justice, too. Here, too, there is much to be done.As an immediate step, Congress should act to rectify racial inequities in the allocation of COVID-19 recovery funds. I will be setting forth more of my agenda on economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. It should be a right not a privilege. The quickest route to universal coverage in this country is to expand Obamacare. We could do it. We should do it. But this president , even now , in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment wants to destroy it. He doesn’t care how many millions of Americans will be hurt , because he is consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to President Obama. The President should withdraw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to act on my proposal to expand Obamacare to millions more. These last few months we have seen America’s true heroes. The health care workers, the nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers.We have a new phrase for them: Essential workers. But we need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. Because if it wasn’t clear before, it’s clear now. This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs. It was built by America’s great middle class , by our essential workers. I know there is enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. And I know so many Americans are suffering. Suffering the loss of a loved one. Suffering economic hardships. Suffering under the weight of generation after generation after generation of hurt inflicted on people of color , and on black and Native communities in particular. I know what it means to grieve. My losses are not the same as the losses felt by so many. But I know what it is to feel like you cannot go on. I know what it means to have a black hole of grief sucking at your chest. Just a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of my son Beau’s passing from cancer. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different from the day he died. But I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn all that anger and anguish to purpose. And, Americans know what our purpose is as a nation. It has guided us from the very beginning. It’s been reported. That on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her father’s arms. “Oh, Daddy,” she said, “now we will never get our freedom.” Her daddy was reassuring, strong, and brave. “Now don’t you worry, baby,” said Martin Luther King, Jr. “It’s going to be all right.” Amid violence and fear, Dr. King persevered.He was driven by his dream of a nation where “justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.” Then, in 1968 hate would cut him down in Memphis. A few days before Dr. King was murdered, he gave a final Sunday sermon in Washington. He told us that though the arc of a moral universe is long, it bends toward justice. And we know we can bend it , because we have. We have to believe that still. That is our purpose. It’s been our purpose from the beginning.To become the nation where all men and women are not only created equal , but treated equally. To become the nation defined , in Dr. King’s words , not only by the absence of tension, but by the presence of justice. Today in America it’s hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that. The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. But our president today is part of the problem. When he tweeted the words “When the looting starts, the shooting starts” , those weren’t the words of a president. They were the words of a racist Miami police chief from the 1960s. When he tweeted that protesters “would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs that’s when people would have been really badly hurt.” Those weren’t the words of a president , those were the kind of words a Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs. The American story is about action and reaction. That’s the way history works. We can’t be naïve about that. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. A tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is both elementsare part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. It’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finally won. But we can’t ignore the truth that we are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists. Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being he leads. I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be. The America we know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won’t either. But I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country , not use them for political gain. I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me. It’s about you. And I’ll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was. To build a better future. That’s what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote the way Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did. We strive to explore the stars, to cure disease, to make this imperfect Union as perfect as we can. We may come up short , but at our best we try. We are facing formidable enemies. They include not only the coronavirus and its terrible impact on our lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty , and that duty includes remembering who we should be.We should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower, of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., of Jonas Salk and Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life and liberty and courage. Above all, we should be the America that cherishes each other , each and every one. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. As President, it is my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues , to listen. Because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that we can overcome. And when we stand together, finally, as One America, we will rise stronger than before. So reach out to one another. Speak out for one another. And please, please take care of each other. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing we can’t do. If we do it together.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-in-philadelphia-pennsylvania-a6c550d42bb9?source=user_profile---------69----------------------------	EmptySummary					'I can't breathe.'

But we need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. Because if it wasn't clear before, it's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs. It was built by America's great middle class , by our essential workers. I know there is enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. And I know so many Americans are suffering. Suffering the loss of a loved one. Suffering economic hardships. Suffering under the weight of generation after generation after generation of hurt inflicted on people of color , and on black and Native communities in particular. I know what it means to grieve. My losses are not the same as the losses felt by so many. But I know what it is to feel like you cannot go on. I know what it means to have a black hole of grief sucking at your chest. Just a few days ago marked the fifth anniversary of my son Beau's passing from cancer. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different from the day he died. But I also know that the best way to bear loss and pain is to turn all that anger and anguish to purpose. And, Americans know what our purpose is as a nation. It has guided us from the very beginning. It's been reported. That on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated, little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her father's arms. 'Oh, Daddy,' she said, 'now we will never get our freedom.' Her daddy was reassuring, strong, and brave. 'Now don't you worry, baby,' said Martin Luther King, Jr. 'It's going to be all right.' Amid violence and fear, Dr. King persevered.He was driven by his dream of a nation where 'justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.' Then, in 1968 hate would cut him down in Memphis. A few days before Dr. King was murdered, he gave a final Sunday sermon in Washington. He told us that though the arc of a moral universe is long, it bends toward justice. And we know we can bend it , because we have. We have to believe that still. That is our purpose. It's been our purpose from the beginning.To become the nation where all men and women are not only created equal , but treated equally. To become the nation defined , in Dr. King's words , not only by the absence of tension, but by the presence of justice. Today in America it's hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that. The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. But our president today is part of the problem. When he tweeted the words 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts' , those weren't the words of a president. They were the words of a racist Miami police chief from the 1960s. When he tweeted that protesters 'would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs that's when people would have been really badly hurt.' Those weren't the words of a president , those were the kind of words a Bull Connor would have used unleashing his dogs. The American story is about action and reaction. That's the way history works. We can't be na�ve about that. I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn't and it won't. American history isn't a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. A tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is both elementsare part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. It's never a rout. It's always a fight. And the battle is never finally won. But we can't ignore the truth that we are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists. Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being he leads. I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids' and grandkids' lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know we can be. The America we know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country , not use them for political gain. I'll do my job and take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget that the job isn't about me. It's about you. And I'll work to not only rebuild this nation. But to build it better than it was. To build a better future. That's what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote the way Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis did. We strive to explore the stars, to cure disease, to make this imperfect Union as perfect as we can. We may come up short , but at our best we try. We are facing formidable enemies. They include not only the coronavirus and its terrible impact on our lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty , and that duty includes remembering who we should be.We should be the America of FDR and Eisenhower, of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., of Jonas Salk and Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life and liberty and courage. Above all, we should be the America that cherishes each other , each and every one. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. As President, it is my commitment to all of you to lead on these issues , to listen. Because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, that we can overcome. And when we stand together, finally, as One America, we will rise stronger than before. So reach out to one another. Speak out for one another. And please, please take care of each other. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing we can't do. If we do it together.
MEJB26202066	Joe Biden	2020-06-02	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the 50th Anniversary of Pride Month	Today, Jill and I are proud to stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies in America and around the world to honor and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pride Month.Fifty years ago, a group of courageous individuals took their first steps towards pride in the Christopher Street Day Liberation March. One year after Stonewall, the world’s first pride march was an act of rebellion, a protest for LGBTQ+ people to be treated as human beings, and a demand that America live up to its founding principles.We’ve made remarkable progress towards LGBTQ+ rights in the decades since, from Harvey Milk’s historic election to the first openly gay major presidential candidate. During the Obama-Biden Administration alone, we signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law; repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell; addressed the epidemic of bullying in schools; established the advancement of LGBTQ+ equality as a foreign policy priority; and the White House beamed bright with the colors of the rainbow to mark the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision recognizing marriage equality.It took hard work. It took acting up, organizing PFLAG moms, developing student activists, and a tireless persistence that HIV/AIDS be destigmatized and treated. Many paid a personal and a professional price just for being who they are , risking their jobs, livelihoods, and physical well-being. Many still do.Despite our progress, much work remains.As our nation grapples with the uncomfortable truths of systemic racism, a devastating pandemic that’s claimed more than 100,000 lives in the United States and left more than 40 million people filing for unemployment, and a President that’s waged an all-out assault on the rights of our most vulnerable, including LGBTQ+ people, we are reminded of why those first brave souls took to the streets to march 50 years ago.Donald Trump and Mike Pence have systematically used the power of the White House as a literal bully pulpit to undermine LGBTQ+ rights. They have given safe harbor to white supremacists and other forms of hate. Predictably, we’ve experienced a rise in hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ people. They rescinded the ability of transgender individuals to openly serve their country in the military, have denied LGBTQ+ people access to critical health care, and are failing to address the epidemic of violence against transgender people. The Trump-Pence Administration has abdicated America’s global leadership on human rights and walked away from our values, repeatedly failing to speak out against the abuses of authoritarian regimes.This is wrong. We must send a clear message that hatred and bigotry have no place in America or on the world stage. As President, I will take swift action to reverse these odious policies and advance our progress toward ending discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. And I will start by signing into law the Equality Act.There are dark and challenging realities ahead that we cannot ignore. Yet, I remain optimistic because I believe in who we are as a nation. I believe in the story of this country and the LGBTQ+ community.Pride has come to be recognized as a global movement of love, self-expression, and community , resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles of Pride and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. Let us celebrate and honor the legacies of Aimee Stephens, Larry Kramer, and Lorena Borjas. Together, we will write a new chapter in America’s march toward justice and win the battle ahead of us this November.Happy Pride.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-50th-anniversary-of-pride-month-656ffc7aac82?source=user_profile---------70----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, Jill and I are proud to stand with LGBTQ+ people and their allies in America and around the world to honor and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pride Month.Fifty years ago, a group of courageous individuals took their first steps towards pride in the Christopher Street Day Liberation March.

MEJB46202064	Joe Biden	2020-06-04	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on the Latest Unemployment Numbers	Amid the deep anguish and the activism we are seeing across the country as Americans speak out about the violence of systemic racism, this morning brought a reminder of the deep economic hurt being inflicted on our country by this pandemic. More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and, as with so many burdens in our society, Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest.Last month, 11 percent of white adults report having been laid off or furloughed , a devastating figure in its own right , and the pain is even more widespread among Black and Latino adults, for whom those numbers have risen to a staggering 16 and 20 percent, respectively.Donald Trump’s failures have been on full display this week. But his failures extend far beyond the last few days , Trump’s slow response to Coronavirus made the crisis worse, and he has spent the last three years favoring the super wealthy and corporations over working families and communities of color.Trump has failed to take seriously not just the scale of this problem, but also who is most impacted. His corrupt recovery is allowing minority business owners to get shut out of COVID-19 recovery funds. We cannot allow this crisis to disempower or inflict further economic pain on Black and Brown people in our society. We must turn this moment into an opportunity to rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations, not widen race-based wealth and income gaps.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-latest-unemployment-numbers-e7fb6045cd06?source=user_profile---------68----------------------------	EmptySummary					Amid the deep anguish and the activism we are seeing across the country as Americans speak out about the violence of systemic racism, this morning brought a reminder of the deep economic hurt being inflicted on our country by this pandemic.

MEJB56202063	Joe Biden	2020-06-05	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden on the Economy and Jobs Report in Dover, Delaware	Good afternoon.Before I speak to the economic situation, I have to take a moment to address something the President said this morning.Toward the end of his remarks today, Donald Trump said he hopes that George Floyd “is looking down and seeing this is a great day for our country.”He was speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence , and by a larger tide of injustice , that has metastasized on this President’s watch.George Floyd’s last words , “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe” , have echoed across our nation.For the President to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd , is frankly despicable.And, the fact that he did so on a day when Black unemployment rose and black youth unemployment skyrocketed , tells you everything you need to know about who this man is and what he cares about.Today, like all Americans, I was glad to see that two-and-a-half million Americans have gotten their jobs back.For those families, that’s a sigh of relief.And for all of us, it’s a reminder of the resilience of the American people.To those Americans, I’m so proud of you, and so happy for you and your families.I was disturbed, however, to see the President crowing this morning , basically hanging a“mission accomplished”’ banner when there is so much work to be done , and so many Americans are still hurting.More than twenty million Americans , one out of every seven U.S. workers , are still out of work.For an enormous swath of our country, their dreams are still on hold. They are still struggling to put food on the table. The unemployment rate remains the highest it’s been in nearly a century.As I said, Black unemployment went up this month. Latino youth unemployment jumped to over 37 percent. Hispanic unemployment overall is four times higher than it was before the President botched his response to the pandemic. And I’m worried, when you look deeper at the data, that while temporary layoffs went down,permanent layoffs went up.Donald Trump still doesn’t get it.He’s out there spiking the football , completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. Those folks aren’t feeling any less pain today than they were yesterday.People who’ve lost their health care in this crisis, they’re not celebrating today , especially when Donald Trump is still in court fighting to strip away health care protections from even more Americans.The fact is, there are about 13 million less jobs today for American workers than the day that President Obama and I left office.So while it’s wonderful to see ten percent of the families who lost their jobs due to Trump’s disastrous pandemic response start to make their way back , the President’s behavior makes me deeply worried for the 90 percent who haven’t.So to all those families , who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied , until this economy starts working for all of you.Let’s be clear about something. The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God , but to the failure of a President. The truth is every country dealt with job losses due to the pandemic, but America was hit much harder out of the gate due to Trump’s complete mismanagement of the response.This morning, he tried to compare our response to Germany’s and South Korea’s.Okay, let’s compare. Germany has one-third of the deaths per capita that we do. South Korea has less than 300 deaths , total. America has four percent of the world’s population , and more than a quarter of the world’s deaths from this pandemic.It’s no secret why that is.Let’s get something straight: he did not act quickly.For months, he downplayed the threat , falsely promising us that anyone could get a test , and claiming that “like a miracle it will disappear.”He repeatedly praised China’s containment response , despite a litany of public appeals , including from me , not to bet American lives and the U.S. economy on the word of the Chinese government.He refused to take action to get adequate testing in place , allowing the virus to spread further than it should have.Columbia University found that 54,000 lives could have been saved if the administration had acted just two weeks earlier.His failure didn’t just cost lives. It cost jobs.New studies this week from Moody’s and Brookings confirm that half or more of those who lost their jobs would still be employed had Trump mounted a competent response like Germany and South Korea and other countries did.We know why this happened. Donald Trump was more focused on the stock wealth of the biggest corporations than he was on the well-being of the American people.It’s why he had his top economic advisors telling people to buy stocks instead of preparing our nation to brace for the pandemic.Now , after 110,000 deaths and more than 20 million people still out of work , the consequences are clear.We are still facing devastating unemployment, an historic health crisis, and a continuing crisisof violence, injustice, and indignity that is devastating Black Americans and diminishing the soul of our country.These are some of the sternest challenges our nation has ever faced, and Trump is patting himself on the back.He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country. He has no idea the depth of pain that people are facing. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference. It is time for him to step out of his bunker and take a look around at the consequences of his words and actions.Let’s be clear , a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of Americans their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.But there’s a deeper concern here. As we recover, some of the temporary job losses we are still not on track to grow back in a way that will actually serve working people.President Trump is still rewarding wealth over work.All we hear coming out of the White House is calls for more tax cuts for big investors and big corporations. Well, they didn’t build this country. The middle class did , that’s who I fight for.And if Trump continues to put the interests of CEOs and shareholders ahead of American workers, we’ll never get to where we need to be as a country.Look, every American has a choice to make this November. Not simply what kind of President we want , but what kind of country we want. What kind of economy we want , and who that economy serves.In the coming weeks, I will lay out in detail my comprehensive plan , not just to build things back to the way they were before COVID-19, but to build back better.To create millions of new, good-paying jobs with benefits where people get a fair return for work and we make our country stronger, more resilient, and more just.That plan will be anchored in job-creating investments, in small businesses, infrastructure -innovation, manufacturing, and caregiving, and in rewiring the faulty structures of our economy to ensure the dignity and equity of all American workers.The public health crisis, the job crisis, and the crisis of inequity and indignity being endured by African Americans , those three challenges are deeply connected to one another.The solutions must be, as well.Any economic plan must start with a public health plan to make sure tests are available, to get our society functioning, to build back the confidence we need to truly bring back jobs and small businesses.But that is only the first step.My jobs plan will also be about restoring dignity to the American people.In addition to pursuing badly-needed reforms, we need to be growing wages, leveling the playing field, and creating tens of millions of the new jobs we need to build a better American future.There is a monumental amount of work to do to repair the damage that has been done. And simply tweeting slogans like “transition to greatness” won’t solve anything for families who are hurting.I look forward to introducing and implementing a real jobs plan that will meet this challenging moment.Americans can’t afford to have any more of their time wasted.They need an economy that works for them , now.They need jobs that bring dignity , now.They need equal justice , and equal opportunities , now.They need a president who cares about them, and cares about helping them heal , now.Thank you.God bless you , and may God protect our troops.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-economy-and-jobs-report-in-f58a3ccdecc?source=user_profile---------67----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon.Before I speak to the economic situation, I have to take a moment to address something the President said this morning.Toward the end of his remarks today, Donald Trump said he hopes that George Floyd 'is looking down and seeing this is a great day for our country.'He was speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence , and by a larger tide of injustice , that has metastasized on this President's watch.George Floyd's last words , 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' , have echoed across our nation.For the President to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd , is frankly despicable.And, the fact that he did so on a day when Black unemployment rose and black youth unemployment skyrocketed , tells you everything you need to know about who this man is and what he cares about.Today, like all Americans, I was glad to see that two-and-a-half million Americans have gotten their jobs back.For those families, that's a sigh of relief.And for all of us, it's a reminder of the resilience of the American people.To those Americans, I'm so proud of you, and so happy for you and your families.I was disturbed, however, to see the President crowing this morning , basically hanging a'mission accomplished' banner when there is so much work to be done , and so many Americans are still hurting.More than twenty million Americans , one out of every seven U.S. workers , are still out of work.For an enormous swath of our country, their dreams are still on hold.

MEJB66202062	Joe Biden	2020-06-06	On Winning a Majority of Delegates in the Democratic Presidential Primary	A little more than three months ago I stood on stage in South Carolina and told the American people that ours was a campaign for everyone who has been knocked down, counted out, and left behind. Those words take on an ever greater resonance today, at a time when so many Americans are hurting and have suffered so much loss. So many feel knocked down by the public health and economic crisis we are weathering. So many feel counted out and left behind by a society that has for too long viewed them as less than equal, their lives as less than precious.This is a difficult time in America’s history. And Donald Trump’s angry, divisive politics is no answer. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together.

Those words take on an ever greater resonance today, at a time when so many Americans are hurting and have suffered so much loss. So many feel knocked down by the public health and economic crisis we are weathering. So many feel counted out and left behind by a society that has for too long viewed them as less than equal, their lives as less than precious.This is a difficult time in America's history. And Donald Trump's angry, divisive politics is no answer. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together. We need an economy that works for everyone , now. We need jobs that bring dignity , now. We need equal justice , and equal opportunities , for every American now. We need a president who cares about helping us heal , now.It was an honor to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the Democratic party has ever fielded , and I am proud to say that we are going into this general election a united party. I am going to spend every day between now and November 3rd fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation, and make sure that as we rebuild our economy, everyone comes along.Today, I'm once again asking every American who feels knocked down, counted out, and left behind, to join our campaign. Because we aren't just building the movement that will defeat Donald Trump, we are building the movement that will transform our nation. I truly believe that when we stand together, finally, as One America, we will rise stronger than before. This is the United States of America. There is nothing we can't do, if we do it together.
MEJB96202061	Joe Biden	2020-06-09	Donald Trump Squandered a Growing Economy	Today’s announcement that our economy has been in recession for months now is a reminder that well before the COVID-19 threat emerged, President Trump had already turned his back on the middle class. Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it.President Trump cut taxes for big corporations and the richest Americans instead of investing in the middle class. Trump drove manufacturing into a recession across the Midwest. And Trump systematically stacked the deck against working families who were struggling to get ahead.And now, even in a recession, President Trump is doubling down on this agenda, diverting money meant for small businesses to big corporations and his wealthy donors, and presiding over the largest corporate bailout in America with no strings attached, and little oversight.The president isn’t responsible for the virus. But he is responsible for a completely bungled response that not only cost thousands of lives, but millions more jobs than should have been lost. The “unprecedented magnitude” of the economic hit, and the “broad reach” of it , that’s on Donald Trump.It did not have to be this way. Millions of Americans are suffering right now because of his negligence and incompetence.We should all remember that when he tries to take credit for the hard work of the American people to get the economy back on track , because he certainly isn’t doing anything to help.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/donald-trump-squandered-a-growing-economy-5840ee3b89fa?source=user_profile---------65----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today's announcement that our economy has been in recession for months now is a reminder that well before the COVID-19 threat emerged, President Trump had already turned his back on the middle class.

MEJB116202060	Joe Biden	2020-06-11	Transcript of Vice President Joe Biden’s Video Message for George Floyd’s Funeral in Houston, Texas	Hello, everyone, on this day of prayer, where we try to understand God’s plan in our pain.To George’s family and friends , Jill and I know the deep hole in your hearts when you bury a piece of your soul deep in this Earth.As I’ve said to you privately , we know. We know you will never feel the same.For most people, the numbness you feel now, will slowly turn, day after day, season after season, into purpose through the memory of the one they lost.But for you, that day has come before you can fully grieve. And unlike most, you must grieve in public. And, it’s a burden. A burden that is now your purpose , to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.Like so many others, I’ve watched with awe as you summon the absolute courage to channel God’s grace and show the good man George was. To stir justice too long dormant and to move millions to act peacefully and purposefully.But among all the people around the world who feel connected to this tragedy, are the ones who lost something that can never, ever be replaced.To George’s children and grandchild, I know you miss you Dad and Granddad.Little Gianna , as I said to you when I saw you yesterday, you are so brave. Daddy is looking down and he is so proud of you. And I know you miss that bear hug that only he could give. That pure joy riding on his shoulders so you could touch the sky. The countless hours he spent playing any game you wanted because your smile, your laugh, your love is the only thing that mattered in at the moment.And I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations.Why? Why is Daddy gone?In looking through your eyes, we should all be asking ourselves why the answer is often too cruel and painful.Why, in this nation, do too many black Americans , wake up knowing they could lose their life , in the course of living their life?Why does justice not roll like a river nor righteousness like a mighty stream? Why?Yet, ladies and gentlemen , we cannot turn away. We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism that stings at our very soul and from systemic abuse that still plagues American life.As Thurgood Marshall once implored, “America must dissent from indifference we must dissent from fear, the hatred, and the mistrust we must dissent because America can do better because America has no choice but to do better.”I grew up with Catholic Social Doctrine which taught me that faith without works is dead and you will know us by what we do.Ladies and Gentlemen, we’ve got to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation to so many people for so long. This is about who we are, what we believe, and maybe most important, who we want to be. To ensure that all men and women are not only created equal but treated equally.We can heal this nation’s wounds and remember its pain, not callous the heart and forget.I know Reverend Sharpton is there in Houston with you today. Rev , I watched you speak from Ecclesiastes last week in Minnesota, Chapter 3, Verse 1, to everything there is a time and a purpose and a season under the heavens.Today, now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal. Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why. Because when there is justice for George Floyd, we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.And then, as you said, Gianna, your Daddy will have “changed the world.”May God be with you, George Floyd, and your family.And in the words from a hymn in my church based on the 91st Psalm, may He raise you up on eagle’s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.God bless you all. God bless you all.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/transcript-of-vice-president-joe-bidens-video-message-for-george-floyd-s-funeral-in-houston-texas-c427064ad51?source=user_profile---------64----------------------------	EmptySummary					Hello, everyone, on this day of prayer, where we try to understand God's plan in our pain.To George's family and friends , Jill and I know the deep hole in your hearts when you bury a piece of your soul deep in this Earth.As I've said to you privately , we know.

He killed 49 innocent people and injured many more , at the time, the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman. And still today, it remains the deadliest attack on the LGBTQ+ community in American history. Sadly, all these years later, terrorism, mass shootings, and hate crimes continue to rip apart our American communities. Our places of worship have been attacked, Hispanics have been targeted in places like El Paso, the death toll from mass shootings continues to mount, and LGBTQ+ people, particularly transgender women of color, are disproportionately targeted by violence. The inaction of Republican lawmakers to address the scourge of gun violence in America is unacceptable, and Jill and I stand with the survivors of mass shootings and all the family members of victims to support the #HonorThemWithAction campaign. We have much more work to do to create a world free of terrorism, hate, bigotry, and violence , and that work has to start by making sure every person has a plan to vote in November. As President, I will continue standing with you to build a more equal, more inclusive United States, where every member of the LGBTQ+ community is safe and respected.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/reflecting-on-the-fourth-anniversary-of-the-pulse-nightclub-shooting-c39abf3abac8?source=user_profile---------61----------------------------	EmptySummary					Four years ago, as members of the LGBTQ+ community were gathered together for 'Latin Night' at Pulse nightclub during Pride Month, a terrorist armed with a semi-automatic rifle opened fire.

MEJB156202054	Joe Biden	2020-06-15	My Statement On the Anniversary of DACA	Eight years ago today, President Obama stood in the Rose Garden and took action to protect Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children, from the threat of deportation. After years of Congressional Republicans blocking legislation, President Obama used his authority to ensure they could work and attend school and participate fully in the life of their communities without fear.The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was an historic achievement of the Obama-Biden Administration, and it was a monumental victory for all those proud members of the community who pushed and pushed for these young people to have a chance at the American dream. More than anything else, it was the right thing to do.What was true eight years ago, remains true today: Dreamers are already Americans in every way that matters. They are proud and patriotic. They serve our nation on the front lines of our military overseas, and they are serving on the front lines as we battle this pandemic at home. More than 200,000 DACA recipients are part of the essential workforce that has been carrying our nation through these past three months. Almost 30,000 of them work in health care. Simply put, they are committed to making this nation better and stronger, and our country cannot afford to lose their incredible talents. It’s long past time we permanently remove the uncertainty and threat of deportation from their lives.Instead, Donald Trump and his anti-immigrant Administration have forced us backward with one cruel and outrageous executive action after another. Trump sees immigration as a wedge to divide and distract the American people from his manifold failures as President. He has executed a campaign of terror against immigrants and Latino communities, abandoned America’s historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum-seekers, and even made it more difficult for people to immigrate to this country and obtain their citizenship legally. And, instead of working toward solutions to protect Dreamers, as he once promised to do, Donald Trump has ripped away protections from DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval.Now, eight years after our Administration made history by creating DACA, the fate of more than 700,000 DACA recipients hangs on the outcome of a Supreme Court ruling. Imagine the anxiety these young people are facing every day, on top of the anger and stress being felt all across our country as we grapple with racial inequities in our society and the fears of living through a pandemic. Imagine going to bed last night wondering if this morning would be the day that decided your fate, or next Thursday, or the week after that. It’s no way to live.When our Administration created the DACA program, we asked Dreamers to place their trust in a humane government that would treat them fairly. We told them we would not abuse their information. We promised to protect them from harm. The Trump Administration has done nothing but exploit that trust and abuse its power, pressuring Congress to push through a deal for a useless border wall in exchange for protecting Dreamers, re-opening long-closed deportation cases against DACA recipients, and most recently suggesting that deporting DACA recipients is “attractive.”Immigrant youth are not a negotiating chip. They are not disposable. They are an integral part of the American fabric. Their story is our story, and their struggles are our struggles. Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress should stop threatening their lives for political gain and instead follow the leadership of Democrats and the House of Representatives and immediately pass into law the DREAM and PROMISE Act.DACA was never meant as a permanent solution. It was not meant to let Congress off the hook for providing a clear path for these young people to claim their citizenship. Dreamers deserve to be able to plan their lives with confidence, as do the 11 million undocumented individuals who are living in and enriching our country every day. On my first day as President, I’ll be sending to Congress a bill outlining a clear roadmap to citizenship. And, as we work to pass a permanent, legislative reform through Congress, I’ll use the full extent of my executive authority to protect Dreamers and keep their families together.Let’s give these young people the certainty and the hope for their futures that they deserve. Let’s finally give them the chance and the opportunity they need to claim their full share of the American Dream.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-anniversary-of-daca-172aa7483535?source=user_profile---------58----------------------------	EmptySummary					Eight years ago today, President Obama stood in the Rose Garden and took action to protect Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children, from the threat of deportation.

Fifty years ago this month, the first Pride march took place in New York City as a protest , as a call for liberation.

MEJB176202053	Joe Biden	2020-06-17	My Remarks in Darby, Pennsylvania, on Reopening the Economy Safely	Good afternoon everyone.And thank you to all the local officials joining me today.Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, and slaughtered my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney and eight other parishioners.It was hatred unbridled. It was a poisonous expression of the white supremacy that still infects our nation and our institutions , and of the dangers we face as a society if we cannot root out this corrosive and deadly ideology.When I reflect back on the amazing grace and compassion and forgiveness of the Mother Emanuel community , I see the very best of who we are as Americans.But we know that grace alone is not enough , we have to put in the work.And we’re seeing the best of America in that as well , in the weeks of peaceful protests and civil actions taking place in cities and towns of every size all across the country.People are keeping our eyes focused on how dangerous it is to live in Black and Brown skin in this country.And Americans are out there marching, notwithstanding the fact that we’re in the middle of a pandemic.On Monday, Donald Trump said, “if we stopped testing right now” for COVID, “we’d have very few cases, if any.” It’s a statement that’s not only absurd , it’s absolutely tragic.And yesterday, the head of the White House task force on coronavirus , the Vice President , claimed success in this fight because deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.750 fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and husbands,wives, children , dying every day.More than 20,000 a month. That’s greater than World War II level casualties each month. That’s more than five 9/11’s each month.And this Administration is self-congratulating?That may be good enough for Donald Trump, but it will never, ever be acceptable if I am President.Researchers have shown that tens of thousands of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to this crisis, and then bungled the response.For weeks in January and February, I was raising my concerns about how we needed to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from the intelligence community in his daily briefing and the warnings of his closest advisors, and praising the Chinese government for being transparent in its handling of the virus, instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus.We’ve lost lives, we lost businesses, we’ve lost paychecks. And now, thanks to Donald Trump’s bungling, we may lose some of the progress we’ve begun to make. All because he’s lost interest. He’s once again ignoring the facts. The public health response is still woefully lacking. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States, with the average daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states , and we still don’t have what we need when it comes to rapid-results testing, contact tracing capacity, widely available personal protective equipment, or clear nationwide guidance.Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous, disproven drugs, stands in the way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening, and he refuses to wear a mask, failing even the most basic test of leadership. He’s scaled back the meetings of the COVID-19 task force in spite of experts saying testing and tracing is necessary for reopening , he’s sent his Testing Czar home.Of the money provided to the Pentagon for essential medical supplies, only 15 percent has been moved out the door.Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy , the coronavirus. But unlike any other war time leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, and now he’s surrendering the fight.Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.And he is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’ll put people at risk, in violation of CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings, as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives , and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.Jobs numbers and retail sales reports were better than expected in May. That’s great news for our country. But now Donald Trump’s desire to declare victory and be done with it will only imperil our continued progress.Our economy is still sputtering, with more than 20 million people unemployed and no clear guidance from the federal government for what businesses need to do to re-open safely and effectively for a strong recovery.This isn’t a debate about whether to reopen , it’s about how we make reopening work for everyone.The employees at the White House get daily COVID-19 tests. They know they are safe before they go to work , and they know their co-workers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives.Workers across the country aren’t asking for daily testing , they’re just asking for regular, reliable access to tests. Don’t they deserve that?So it’s not that Donald Trump doesn’t recognize the importance of testing. It’s that he’s not up to the task. And now, he’s seemingly decided that he doesn’t even want to try. But just like he couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April , he can’t ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President Donald Trump: What are you going to do to make sure every worker has access to regular testing so that they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work as White House staffers? Why are you leaving schools and child care centers to navigate this uncertainty all on their own without the effective guidance and resources they need to help protect kids and their communities?Why won’t you enforce an OSHA standard for worker protections during a global pandemic?Why is it that the Main Street lending program, created more than two months ago by the Congress to help struggling small businesses, only opened for registration to lenders two days ago , and still hasn’t distributed a single penny? And why won’t you disclose the names of the businesses who received a total of $500 billion in taxpayer funding? Why are they being hidden?How many cronies got bailouts? How many donors?What businesses had to shut down because they were denied funding in April, and what businesses get special approval thanks to a nod from the top?Why did you get rid of the watchdog originally appointed to oversee it?What are you trying to hide? It’s bad management on top of bad planning on top of neglect. And it’s unacceptable. Folks, here’s the truth: This pandemic is still here. It’s going to be here for the foreseeable future , until we get it under control, or until we have a safe, proven, widely-available vaccine. COVID-19 is a fact of nature. We have to deal with this virus, and everything that comes with it, head on. And we can deal with it, if we put in the work and invest in building a dynamic, resilient economy and health system capable of getting , and then staying , ahead of new outbreaks. We have the capacity and the resources to do that.I’ve laid out the baseline steps of what needs to be done , from the “Make it Work” checklist for a successful, accountable recovery that I put out back in early April, to the steps for a strong re-opening that I released last week.It’s not rocket science. It’s common sense. It’s straightforward. And that’s why this is perhaps the greatest indictment of Donald Trump’s complete lack of leadership. He wasted months and months and months passing the buck, blaming everyone else, and refusing to act when we should have been preparing our country for a long-term response and building up our resiliency to respond to future flare-ups. Yet, we still don’t have a comprehensive system for collecting COVID-19 case data. These are the basics. He should have been preparing us to weather the valleys and peaks of this virus. He should have been working to shore up the vulnerabilities in our health care system that have been laid bare by this crisis. He should have been working to bridge the inequities and strengthen the cracks in the foundation of our economic system that are exposed for all to see.He hasn’t done any of it. And because of the depth of Donald Trump’s failures, this pandemic will continue to be worse for all Americans, and much worse for Black and Brown Americans, who are getting hit the hardest. For folks in communities like Darby Borough and Yeadon. Donald Trump thinks that if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will too. But it doesn’t work that way. Not when hundreds of people are still dying every day, and millions are unemployed, wondering how they’re going to keep the lights on and food on the table.Not when workers are weighed down with worries about their safety or what happens if they get sick. And there are the steps that we need to be taking now to steer us , steady and strong , through these difficult times to a more resilient future. First, we have to do everything we can to avoid deadly spikes of infections as people begin to go back out into the world. We are not that much better prepared today for a run of cases that over-fills our intensive care units than we were 3 months ago. And second , we have to help give people the assurance and precautions that are necessary to restart our economy with confidence. If Americans lose what faith they have left in our government’s ability to manage this pandemic, we will see a much deeper and longer-lasting economic impact that will have even greater repercussions for people’s well-being. Mr. President: Don’t leave the American people to face this threat on their own , with no guidance, resources, or leadership from the federal government.Don’t let the support from the CARES Act expire next month while people are still hurting.Don’t leave our front line workers exposed and without the resources they need. And don’t waste any more of our time. The American people need the confidence of clear guidelines, grounded in science, that will allow them to resume their daily lives safely. American businesses need the support of the federal government to continue to backstop them through the phases of reopening, and workers need the assurance that their health is the first concern. America needs a president who will put the American people first, not his own ego. America needs a president who will do the work. I’m ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn’t Donald Trump?	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-remarks-in-darby-pennsylvania-on-reopening-the-economy-safely-4a869ea8b11?source=user_profile---------56----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon everyone.And thank you to all the local officials joining me today.Before I begin my remarks, I want to acknowledge that it was five years ago today when a white supremacist walked into the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, and slaughtered my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney and eight other parishioners.It was hatred unbridled. It was a poisonous expression of the white supremacy that still infects our nation and our institutions , and of the dangers we face as a society if we cannot root out this corrosive and deadly ideology.When I reflect back on the amazing grace and compassion and forgiveness of the Mother Emanuel community , I see the very best of who we are as Americans.But we know that grace alone is not enough , we have to put in the work.And we're seeing the best of America in that as well , in the weeks of peaceful protests and civil actions taking place in cities and towns of every size all across the country.People are keeping our eyes focused on how dangerous it is to live in Black and Brown skin in this country.And Americans are out there marching, notwithstanding the fact that we're in the middle of a pandemic.On Monday, Donald Trump said, 'if we stopped testing right now' for COVID, 'we'd have very few cases, if any.' It's a statement that's not only absurd , it's absolutely tragic.And yesterday, the head of the White House task force on coronavirus , the Vice President , claimed success in this fight because deaths are 'down to' fewer than 750 a day.750 fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and husbands,wives, children , dying every day.More than 20,000 a month. That's greater than World War II level casualties each month. That's more than five 9/11's each month.And this Administration is self-congratulating?That may be good enough for Donald Trump, but it will never, ever be acceptable if I am President.Researchers have shown that tens of thousands of Americans have died needlessly because Donald Trump was slow to respond to this crisis, and then bungled the response.For weeks in January and February, I was raising my concerns about how we needed to take this virus seriously, all while Trump was ignoring the reporting from the intelligence community in his daily briefing and the warnings of his closest advisors, and praising the Chinese government for being transparent in its handling of the virus, instead of demanding access for the CDC that Beijing was refusing to give. The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus.We've lost lives, we lost businesses, we've lost paychecks. And now, thanks to Donald Trump's bungling, we may lose some of the progress we've begun to make. All because he's lost interest. He's once again ignoring the facts. The public health response is still woefully lacking. More than 117,000 people have died in the United States, with the average daily number of cases still climbing in 21 states , and we still don't have what we need when it comes to rapid-results testing, contact tracing capacity, widely available personal protective equipment, or clear nationwide guidance.Instead, President Trump pushes dangerous, disproven drugs, stands in the way of the CDC issuing guidelines on reopening, and he refuses to wear a mask, failing even the most basic test of leadership. He's scaled back the meetings of the COVID-19 task force in spite of experts saying testing and tracing is necessary for reopening , he's sent his Testing Czar home.Of the money provided to the Pentagon for essential medical supplies, only 15 percent has been moved out the door.Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy , the coronavirus. But unlike any other war time leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, and now he's surrendering the fight.Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.And he is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he'll put people at risk, in violation of CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings, as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable. Donald Trump's failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives , and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.Jobs numbers and retail sales reports were better than expected in May. That's great news for our country. But now Donald Trump's desire to declare victory and be done with it will only imperil our continued progress.Our economy is still sputtering, with more than 20 million people unemployed and no clear guidance from the federal government for what businesses need to do to re-open safely and effectively for a strong recovery.This isn't a debate about whether to reopen , it's about how we make reopening work for everyone.The employees at the White House get daily COVID-19 tests. They know they are safe before they go to work , and they know their co-workers are safe. They have the confidence to resume their lives.Workers across the country aren't asking for daily testing , they're just asking for regular, reliable access to tests. Don't they deserve that?So it's not that Donald Trump doesn't recognize the importance of testing. It's that he's not up to the task. And now, he's seemingly decided that he doesn't even want to try. But just like he couldn't wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn't tweet it away in April , he can't ignore it away in June. So I have some basic questions for President Donald Trump: What are you going to do to make sure every worker has access to regular testing so that they have the same confidence to go into a store or go back to work as White House staffers?

MEJB186202051	Joe Biden	2020-06-18	My statement on the Supreme Court’s Decision in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California	The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. As President, I will immediately work to make it permanent by sending a bill to Congress on day one of my Administration.As Justice Roberts said, the Trump administration’s action was capricious and arbitrary. If Trump attempts to repeal DACA again , an unconscionable action, particularly during this unprecedented public health crisis , he will be responsible for upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people and bringing harm to families and communities all across the country.For over eight years, DACA has given hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who came to this country as children the chance to contribute to the country they know as home. And with that opportunity, they have shown the incredible capacity of the immigrant spirit. Today, DACA recipients are engineers, doctors, and lawyers. They have succeeded at the highest levels of academia. Many have started their own small businesses, which pay taxes and provide jobs for U.S. citizens. Nearly a third of all current DACA recipients are essential workers helping our communities respond to the COVID19 pandemic. Nearly 30,000 of them are front-line health care workers.The joy of today’s victory does not erase the difficult road ahead. We know that much work remains to be done. But I will continue to stand with DACA recipients, their parents, and their families at every step, and in November, joined by millions across this country, we will reject the President who tried to rip so many of our family members, friends, and coworkers out of our lives.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-in-department-of-homeland-c8db3da63682?source=user_profile---------54----------------------------	EmptySummary					The Supreme Court's ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored.

MEJB186202052	Joe Biden	2020-06-18	My Statement on John Bolton’s Revelations	Today, we learned from John Bolton, the President’s former national security advisor, that President Trump sold out the American people to protect his political future. He reportedly directly asked Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to help him get re-elected. He was willing to trade away our most cherished democratic values for the empty promise of a flimsy trade deal that bailed him out of his disastrous tariff war that did so much damage to our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers.If these accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.For months, our country and the world have suffered through the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 117,000 Americans have lost their lives and tens of millions of workers are unemployed , and we’ve been hurt far worse because of Donald Trump’s inability to lead and his failure to meet the crisis. Today we learned more about the depth and nature of that failure.Why didn’t he act when the warning signs were so clear? Why did he ignore his briefings from the intelligence community, the warnings from his own team, and from me? Why did he repeatedly praise the Chinese government and President Xi as the coronavirus spread? Because he wanted to have a trade deal with China as a talking point for his re-election campaign. He thought that letting the President of China run the table on us in the long run would give him another term in the short run. In exchange, he was willing to stay silent on Hong Kong. In exchange, he condoned interning more than one million Uighurs in concentration camps. It’s no wonder that this week we’ve also seen reporting that China wants four more years of Donald Trump as president, because he has so weakened the United States.Donald Trump’s behavior disgraces the American presidency. We knew that long before today’s revelations.And my message to China’s leaders, or anyone else who President Trump might invite to interfere: stay out of our democracy. Stay out of our elections. The American people alone will decide the future of this country, and I am confident in the choice they will make.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-john-boltons-revelations-61f90477d555?source=user_profile---------55----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, we learned from John Bolton, the President's former national security advisor, that President Trump sold out the American people to protect his political future.

MEJB206202050	Joe Biden	2020-06-20	My Statement on World Refugee Day	World Refugee Day is the time when all nations recognize the humanity and resilience of the millions of people forced from their homes by persecution, war, and violence and renew our commitment to protect the most vulnerable. The United States has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope , a role model in resettling refugees and leading the humanitarian response abroad. But today is also a bitter reminder of how Donald Trump has tried to change America from a nation of refuge and liberty to one of division and intolerance. Fear-mongering, xenophobia, and racism are the unabashed tenets of Trump’s refugee and immigration policy, and his divisive, dangerous, and undemocratic response to Black Lives Matter is a reminder of this administration’s devaluation of Black, Brown, and other minority communities not only in the United States, but around the world. But we will not, and we cannot, allow hate and rage to divide us further. Decades ago, giants of the civil rights movement like Bayard Rustin recognized the universal fight for freedom and safety and urged the United States to accept more refugees. Their call is even more urgent today as the number of those forcibly displaced worldwide reaches nearly 80 million people worldwide , roughly 1 percent of humanity. Donald Trump has made clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. He has slashed refugee admissions by more than 80 percent and, just this past week, released an immoral and likely unlawful rule that makes it nearly impossible for most asylum-seekers to qualify for protection in the United States . He has cruelly separated thousands of children from their parents, sought to prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum, and severely limited the ability of members of the LGBTQ+ community, an especially vulnerable group in many parts of the world, from qualifying for asylum. And he has turned his back on the men and women who served honorably alongside our soldiers, diplomats, and aid workers in Iraq and Afghanistan as interpreters and guides, and now find that their lives, and the lives of their families, are threatened for this service. This cannot stand. As one of the co-sponsors of the 1980 Refugee Act, I believe that resettling refugees helps reunite families, enriches the fabric of America, and enhances our standing, influence, and security in the world. Right now, many refugees are also working on the frontlines of the pandemic response, as nursing aides, doctors, meatpackers, and grocery clerks, among other essential workers. Restoring America’s historic role as leader in resettlement and defending the rights of refugees everywhere will take concrete action. As President, I will increase the number of refugees we welcome into this country, setting an annual global refugee target of 125,000 , up from a ceiling of 18,000 under Trump , and will seek to further raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need. I will support efforts to work with Congress in a bipartisan fashion to protect our refugee policy from drastic and arbitrary reductions we have seen during the Trump Administration and establish a minimum admissions number of at least 95,000 refugees annually. I will pursue policies that increase opportunities for faith and local communities to sponsor refugee resettlement. I will make more channels, such as higher education visas, available to those seeking safety. I will repeal the Muslim ban , and other discriminatory bans based on ethnicity and nationality , and restore asylum laws, including ending the horrific practice of separating families at our border. I will work with our allies and partners to stand against China’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms and mass detention and repression of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities and support a pathway for those persecuted to find safe haven in the United States and other nations. I also recognize that it is not enough to simply reverse or dismantle the heartless policies of the Trump Administration. We need to look for ways to do better. On this World Refugee Day, we all must stand together and recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. That’s how we will restore the soul of our nation.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-world-refugee-day-fddb4abddfd5?source=user_profile---------53----------------------------	EmptySummary					World Refugee Day is the time when all nations recognize the humanity and resilience of the millions of people forced from their homes by persecution, war, and violence and renew our commitment to protect the most vulnerable.

MEJB236202049	Joe Biden	2020-06-23	My Statement on the 21st Anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Landmark Disability Rights Decision in Olmstead v. L.C.	Twenty-one years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead v. L.C. that people with disabilities could no longer be unduly isolated or segregated in institutions, and that doing so is a form of unlawful discrimination. In the years since, millions of Americans with disabilities have been better able to build full, independent lives in their communities , working meaningful jobs, building neighborhood and civic ties, and moving closer to realizing the promise of America that everyone so deserves.But, we have so much more work to do. Waiting lists for home and community-based services are often long, shutting out many who’d like to receive them. And, Donald Trump is still working to gut the Medicaid program that supports these and so many other services that are essential to people with disabilities , not to mention to repeal Obamacare and strip millions of vital health coverage in the middle of a pandemic.Today, it’s past time to begin the reforms needed to turn Olmstead’s promise into a lasting reality. I’m committed to ensuring that all 61 million Americans with disabilities have every opportunity to fully participate in our society.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-21st-anniversary-of-the-supreme-courts-landmark-disability-rights-decision-in-d631af0ba77?source=user_profile---------52----------------------------	EmptySummary					Twenty-one years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead v.

MEJB256202048	Joe Biden	2020-06-25	My Remarks on the Affordable Care Act in Lancaster, Pennsylvania	Good afternoon.Today, in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump will file a brief in the Supreme Court to attempt to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans could lose their coverage outright , including nearly a million Pennsylvanians.Insurers could once again discriminate, or deny services, or drop coverage for people living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer.And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition. Some survivors will experience lasting health impacts , like lung scarring and heart damage. And if Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed to strip away coverage or jack up premiums , simply because of their battle with the coronavirus. Those survivors, having struggled and won the fight of their lives, would have their peace of mind stolen away at the moment they need it most. They would live their lives caught in a vise between Donald Trump’s twin legacies: his failure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take health care protections away from American families.I have called on Donald Trump many times to withdraw his lawsuit. Today, I am renewing that call.Mr. President, drop the lawsuit. Stop trying to take away people’s health care.Now more than ever, stop trying to steal their peace of mind. I cannot comprehend the cruelty that is driving him to inflict this pain on the very people he is supposed to serve.One of the families the Affordable Care Act has delivered peace of mind to is the Ritters , who live not far from here in Manheim, Pennsylvania.Jan and Madeline Ritter were just four years old when their mom, Stacie, heard some of the most devastating words that a parent can ever hear. Both of her twins had been diagnosed with leukemia.I promise you , that news , it stops your heart. It wrenches your entire world off of its axis. And the very last thing on your mind , the very last thing that should be on your mind , is whether you can afford treatment.But when Stacie’s twins got sick, there was no Affordable Care Act.So, after the draining days and the endless nights, the harrowing stem-cell transplants, the fickle waves of hope and fear, after enduring more than any parent should have to endure, the Ritters still faced a future where their twins could be denied coveragefor the rest of their lives.The Affordable Care Act was created to put a stop to that inhumanity , to ensure that people like Stacie, thrust into the worst nightmare of their lives, could focus on the fight that matters.Stacie’s twins won their fight. They beat cancer , and now, they’re 22 years old. Jan is studying early education at Elizabethtown College. Madeline just graduated from Arcadia University with a degree in international studies. And because of the law, insurance companies can no longer deny them coverage because they’re survivors of cancer.I’m proud of the Affordable Care Act.In addition to protecting people with pre-existing conditions, this is a law that delivered vital coverage to more than 20 million Americans.It’s a law that bars insurance companies from capping Americans’ benefits , and from charging women more simply because they are women.It’s a law that reduced prescription drug costs for nearly 12 million seniors, who would see their those costs spike , because the Medicare ‘donut hole’would have suddenly reopened.It’s a law that saves lives.But now, in the middle of the worst public health crisis in modern history, Donald Trump is suing to take the Ritters and millions more Americans , back to the way things were.It’s cruel, it’s heartless, and it’s callous.And it’s all because he can’t abide the thought of letting stand one of President Obama’s greatest achievements.We’ve seen that same callousness in his handling of the coronavirus.Just over three months ago, as most Americans were first coming to grips with the unprecedented scale and danger of the pandemic, President Trump publicly claimed that, “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”That wasn’t true. And he knew it.Then, five days ago, at his campaign gathering in Tulsa, he admitted telling his people to, slow the testing down, please.” At first, his spokespeople tried to say he was joking. But then Trump himself said he wasn’t joking.He called testing, “a double-edged sword.” Let’s be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives, and widespread testing is the key to opening up our economy again , so that’s one edge of the sword. The other edge: that he thinks finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad. And that’s what he’s worried about. He’s worried about looking bad.Well, Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks and start caring aboutwhat’s really happening in America.The number of cases is increasing in 29 states. We are going to be dealing with this for a long time. Trump can’t wish it away. He can’t bend it to meet his political wishes. There are no miracles coming.We are going to have to step up as Americans , all of us , and do both the simple things , and the hard things , to keep our families and neighbors safe, to re-open our economy, and to eventually put the pandemic behind us.And sadly , we are going to have to do it without responsible leadership from the White House. So it is up to us. All of us.We’re going to have to wear masks. And I know as Americans it’s not something we’re used to. But it matters. All the evidence from all over the world tells us it just might be the most effective thing we can do.We’re going to have to socially distance. It’s not easy. It seems so strange to us. Not as Americans, but as human beings. We’re built to talk, to laugh, to hug, to gather with other people. I know I am. I know you are. But for now, we have to socially distance. It matters.We’re going to have to find a way to keep our economy running as we bring the number of cases down. The president wants you to believe this is a choice between the economy and the public’s health. He still hasn’t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis: to fix our economy, we have to get control of the virus.He’s like a child who just can’t believe this has happened to him. It’s all whining and self-pity. This pandemic didn’t happen to him. It happened to all of us.And his job isn’t to whine about it. His job is to do something about it.If I have the honor of becoming President, I promise you I will lead.I will do everything I can to take responsibility and ease that burden on you and your families. I will put your family first. And that will begin with a dramatic expansion of health coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs.We need a public option now more than ever , especially at a time when more than 20 million people are unemployed.That public option will allow every American , regardless of their employment status , the choice to get a Medicare-like plan.It will force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have a profit motive.We’re going to lower premiums for people buying coverage on their own by guaranteeing that no American ever has to spend more than 8.5 percent of their income on health insurance , and that number will be lower for lower-income families.We’re also going to further reduce costs by making it less expensive for Americans to choose plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses by lowering prescription drug prices and by ending the practice called “surprise billing,” which can leave you with an unexpectedly high bill after you leave a hospital.Here’s the bottom line: my plan lowers health care costs and gets us to universal coverage quickly when Americans desperately need it.Families are reeling right now , enduring illnesses, forced into risky choices, losing their employer plans in droves.They need a lifeline now. That’s what the families here today deserve. That’s what families all across this nation deserve.They don’t need a president going into court to deny them health care. They need a president going into the White House who will fight for the health care they need.If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him. And working quickly with Congress to dramatically ramp up protections, get America to universal coverage, and lower health care costs as soon as humanly possible.This is my promise to you. When I am President, I will take care of your health coverage the same way I would for my own family. This is personal to me.I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed. My wife and daughter had been killed in a car crash , and lying in that bed were my two surviving little boys.I couldn’t imagine what it would have been like if we didn’t have the health care we needed immediately.Forty years later, one of those little boys, my son Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only months to live.I couldn’t imagine an insurance company coming in and saying, “for the last six months of your life, you’re on your own” , which is exactly what happened to so many families before the Affordable Care Act.So Amy, I understand.And when I say I’ll take care of your health coverage the same way I would for my family , there is nothing I take more seriously.That’s my promise to Stacie and Victoria and Amy and to every American.That’s what the presidency is , a duty to care.A duty to care for everyone.Not just those who voted for us.For all of us.And no trust is more sacred, no responsibility is more solemn, no purpose is more fundamental, than for a President to do absolutely everything he or she can to protect American lives.So I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day , I will not abandon you.I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.We are going to get through this , together.And we are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than it has ever been before.Thank you. God bless you, and God protect our troops.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-remarks-on-the-affordable-care-act-in-lancaster-pennsylvania-fb7b6b530369?source=user_profile---------51----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon.Today, in the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump will file a brief in the Supreme Court to attempt to strip health coverage away from tens of millions of families, and to strip the peace of mind away from more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.If he succeeds, more than 23 million Americans could lose their coverage outright , including nearly a million Pennsylvanians.Insurers could once again discriminate, or deny services, or drop coverage for people living with preexisting conditions like asthma, diabetes, and cancer.And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19 could become a new pre-existing condition.

MEJB266202047	Joe Biden	2020-06-26	My Statement on the Trump Administration Stopping Funding for Federal Testing Sites Amid Climbing COVID-19 Cases	On Saturday, President Trump told America that he wants testing to be slowed down for the sake of craven political optics. This week he doubled down, and we’re painfully learning more about what that looks like.Now, on the very same day that America marked a record high for new COVID-19 cases, the Trump Administration announced that it was going to quickly strip funding from all federal testing sites nationwide , even from seven testing centers in Texas, a rapidly growing hotspot.President Trump thinks that if he just ignores COVID-19 it will go away. It’s the exact same tactic Trump has tried since I, and others, raised the alarm about the coronavirus in January, and it’s a defeatist mindset that’s left over 120,000 Americans dead and our economy reeling with almost 20 million people out of work.Trump simply couldn’t be more wrong. We need more testing, not less, and we need faster, not slower. I proposed in March that we quickly stand up 500 federal testing sites, sites that are free, easily accessible, and in every state in our country. Instead of heeding my call, Trump , true to his word , is winding down funding for the few federal testing sites there are, and reports have shown that his administration is sitting on billions of dollars earmarked to boost testing and tracing.Trump is fine with one federal testing center: at the White House to keep him and his aides safe, but he treats testing ordinary Americans like a political inconvenience, or worse, when it exposes the true extent of his failure to combat this virus.We can’t stop the spread of this disease and save lives without more testing. We can’t safely re-open our economy and get Americans back to work without more testing. And, we can’t let our testing, and our response to this virus, be held hostage by Donald Trump’s whims and political calculations.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-trump-administration-stopping-funding-for-federal-testing-sites-amid-climbing-21197b4b3cd4?source=user_profile---------50----------------------------	EmptySummary					On Saturday, President Trump told America that he wants testing to be slowed down for the sake of craven political optics.

MEJB286202046	Joe Biden	2020-06-28	My Statement on Immigrant Heritage Month	America is, and must forever remain, a nation of immigrants. It is written in our DNA; it is reflected in our Constitution; it is emblazoned in the base of the Statue of Liberty , that “from her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome.” Throughout the month of June, Jill and I are excited to celebrate Immigrant Heritage Month, a time for every American to pay tribute to the continuous, vital, and innumerable contributions that immigrants make to our nation.Unless your ancestors were native to this land, or forcibly brought to these shores as part of our country’s original sin of slavery, the history of your family in America can be traced back to a courageous and optimistic choice: to leave behind everything familiar in search of a better life. Generation after generation, America is fortified anew by waves of immigrants , people of hope and drive who come from every part of the world to refuel our dynamism and broaden our national fabric.Immigrants have always propelled and sustained our nation , lifting us to new heights economically and culturally, helping our communities and industries thrive, and furthering our essential spirit of innovation. This June, we are particularly mindful of the millions of immigrants combating COVID-19 on the front lines as doctors and nurses, delivery drivers and grocery clerks, researchers, small business owners, and in so many other capacities. As ever, immigrants are stepping up for all of us , even as they grapple with the pandemic at disproportionate levels due in part to unconscionable health and economic disparities that have been allowed to fester for too long.Now more than ever, we must do more than simply celebrate the contributions and honor the sacrifices of immigrants. We must come together as a nation to eradicate the systemic racism that denies so many immigrant and minority families their fair shot at the American Dream. And we must reaffirm our unique strength and our foundational promise , that we are an immigrant nation by design and by desire. When we celebrate our immigrants, we celebrate America itself, and the most fundamental of American values. Jill and I will always fight to preserve those values and deliver dignity and respect to immigrants, so that this nation never ceases to “lift [her] lamp beside the golden door” for all who dream of being an American.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-immigrant-heritage-month-d3b0f55b5df1?source=user_profile---------49----------------------------	EmptySummary					America is, and must forever remain, a nation of immigrants.

MEJB306202044	Joe Biden	2020-06-30	My remarks on Trump’s Failures To Protect The American People.	For weeks, we’ve seen the warning signs , the numbers don’t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than they are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at an alarming rate. And once again it’s confirming the simple fact that we won’t be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. Despite the Administration’s propaganda that their response should be “a cause for celebration,” despite President Trump’s request that we should slow down testing, because he thinks it makes him look bad, COVID-19 is still here. A daily threat to American health and prosperity. It did not have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I sounded the alarm over the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that he had COVID-19 “totally under control” and that everything would all “work out well.” In February, I warned about our failure to get information we needed from the Chinese government. I said if I were President, I would demand it. Trump said we were in “great shape” and reported that China’s president said it was “doing very well.” In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally-funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. And later that month, I called for the full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act to deliver critical supplies. Trump accused health care workers of stealing masks. In April, I released plans to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a Pandemic Testing Board, and launch a nationwide health corps to focus on contact tracing. Trump’s suggestion? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving our public health and our economy. I urged the Administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump’s response? He pushed for reopening without regard for safety and called testing “frankly overrated.” This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, and state and local governments the tools, resources, and guidance they would need. Trump’s proposal? He set a cutoff date for federal funding for testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take health care away from millions. And now, Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember back in March when he called himself a wartime president? Remember when he exhorted the nation to “sacrifice together” to face an “invisible enemy”? What happened? Now it’s almost July and it seems the wartime president has surrendered , has waved the white flag and left the field of battle. Today we’re facing a serious threat, and we must meet it , as one country. But this President gives us no direction. He pits us against one another. We can’t continue on like this , half recovering and half getting worse. We can’t continue , half wearing masks and half rejecting science We can’t continue , half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach , lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, and raising the likelihood of needing to re-impose restrictions. Until our science catches up to our reality , until we have better treatments for those who become infected and ultimately a safe, proven, widely available vaccine , we have to continue to do all we can as a people and as a government to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy. Today, I am releasing a plan with the steps Donald Trump should undertake immediately. It builds on the roadmap I released back in March that would have saved lives if it had been adopted. It is a plan to save lives in the months ahead. Once again , I encourage him to adopt this plan in its entirety. This is too important for politics. First, testing, testing, testing. More testing is not only how you find more cases of coronavirus, Mr. President, it’s how you stop more cases. Testing , followed by rigorous contact tracing and quarantine and isolation protocols for those who have been exposed. People aren’t waiting in miles-long lines in baking hot cars for a drive-through nasal swab for the fun of it. They’re doing it so they can protect themselves and their families. We know we’re not where we need to be on testing. There are still hospitals and nursing homes that don’t have access to the tests they need. Testing is how we see what’s happening in communities all across the country. It’s our eyes on the ground. Without it, we’re flying blind. That’s why it’s so important to have reliable access to testing everywhere. We need to increase federal support for testing , that includes doubling the number of drive-through testing sites. And keep increasing them until there are no lines. We should create a Pandemic Testing Board to spearhead a nationwide campaign so every worker who is called back to their job can have the confidence that they and their co-workers are not infected. Experts agree that we need more contact tracers to track the path of this virus. Individual states like New York and California are already hiring and training thousands of tracers. But we need more,including hiring at least 100,000 federally funded workers to perform contact tracing and other public health tasks. Second, every single front line worker should have the personal protective equipment they need to be safe. Five months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still forced to scramble for their own supplies and must reuse masks , shift after shift. Hundreds of health care workers have died from COVID-19, and tens of thousands have been infected. It should be zero on both counts. How are we this many months in and we still , still , don’t have what we need? This is why we have a Defense Production Act. Use your authority this week, Mr. President, to scale up the production of N-95 masks. The steps you’ve taken so far haven’t gotten the job done. Fix the shortage of PPE for our health care workers before you tee off for yet another round of golf. We can’t just look at where we are today , we’re going to need masks and gloves and face shields for the foreseeable future. We need to be ready. Third, there should be a laser-focus on treatments and vaccines. We should be leading a coordinated, global approach on the science , not disregarding the experts while pushing dangerous and disproven drugs as a treatment. There has been some progress towards treatments and vaccines. But the administration hasn’t been transparent about how they plan to manufacture enough doses, and make sure they are equitably distributed at scale. Every person in the United States must be able to get the vaccine when available. The White House should report weekly on this progress. We can’t end up with the same scarcity and distribution problems we did with testing. And we need to make sure that consumers aren’t being gouged as new drugs and therapies are developed. We must immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization. For all its shortcomings and missteps around COVID-19, this is why the WHO was created. It is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic. And the United States should be leading the way. COVID-19 will likely worsen at the onset of flu season this year. So we need to put in place measures now to ensure the seasonal flu vaccine can be readily available and administered safely to those who need it under social distancing guidelines , especially for seniors. Fourth, we need real plans, real guidelines with uniform, nation-wide standards to help chart our economic reopening. Whatever it is that we’re doing now , it’s not working. A state-by-state approach will only produce confusion and slow any progress. The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like , the Administration delayed and scaled them back. We need clear, evidence-based steps that states can adopt , both the standards that must be met in order to safely proceed with further opening, and the re-imposition of social distancing rules when cases begin to rise. We need to support schools and child care programs so parents can return to work, confident that their kids will be safe and cared for. We should be providing “Safer for Shoppers” certifications to stores that prove they are minimizing their customers’ risk of exposure. And we absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government , that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period. It’s not just about you , it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe. It’s a simple measure that is also one of the most effective things we can do right now. It may be inconvenient , but it’s the right thing to do as an American. Finally,we need to protect the populations most at risk from this virus. Our Seniors. Our Black and Brown and Native communities that are being hit the hardest. Vulnerable populations with pre-existing conditions. I know that this continued growth in case numbers is causing fear. People , especially older Americans and those with loved ones in nursing homes , are scared. This isn’t just taking a toll on their physical health, there’s an emotional cost as well. We can’t expect vulnerable populations to quarantine indefinitely without support. And I want them to know that their health and safety will be my responsibility as president. I will not abandon you. Those are five simple, straightforward steps that will help us defeat this pandemic. And if you suspect that a lot of these steps are the same sorts of things I was talking about in March when I released my first COVID-19 Response Plan , you’re right. If it feels like you’ve been hearing the experts talk about these same issues for months , you’re right. These have always been the steps the government needed to put in place to meet this threat. The state-wide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us the time to get our act together. But instead of using that time to prepare ourselves , Donald Trump squandered it. Now here we are, more than three months later, and we’re hardly better prepared than we were in March. Infections on the rise. The threat of massive spikes that overwhelm the capacity of our health care system. Americans anxious and out of work, fearful for their lives and their loved ones. And Donald Trump is doing next-to-nothing about it. Mr. President , the crisis is real , and it’s surging. Promises and predictions and wishful thinking pulled out of thin air are not only doing this country no good, it’s making them lose more faith in their government America knows this crisis isn’t behind us. Even if you don’t. They see what is happening. Even if you refuse to. They know a coordinated national plan is needed now. Even though you won’t do it. You’ve called yourself a “cheerleader” for the nation. We don’t need a cheerleader. We need a President. A president who will level with the American people. A president who will tell us the unvarnished truth. A president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts and follow the science. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation: Wear a mask, keep your distance, limit the size of any crowd. It’s not about you, Mr. President , it’s about the health and well-being of the American public. The American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rantings and tweets. They didn’t make these sacrifices so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing a mask into a political statement. And they certainly didn’t do it so you could wash your hands and walk away. Maybe there are times this nation needs a cheerleader. Now isn’t one of them. We need a president. Whatever Trump does , or does not do , we cannot know today what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next January. But it almost certainly won’t be over. If I should have the honor of being elected President, on the day I’m sworn in I’ll get right to work implementing all aspects of the response that remain undone. I’ll have more to say about my Day One COVID-19 agenda in the weeks to come. But my response will begin well before I take the oath of office. It will start as soon as the election is decided. I will be a president who respects scientists, and who won’t censor their ability to speak directly to the American people. I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Anthony Fauci to ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. I’ll have from day one , ready to go , the best medical experts and scientists to advise on our response. And I’ll listen to them. I will work with governors and mayors of both parties, and from every state, territory, and tribe. We are all in this together. We will fight this together. And we will emerge from this stronger, because we did it together. And now, I’m happy to take a few of your questions.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-remarks-on-trumps-failures-to-protect-the-american-people-2428387e99c?source=user_profile---------47----------------------------	EmptySummary					For weeks, we've seen the warning signs , the numbers don't lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than they are going down. More than 125,000 people in the United States have lost their lives, and those numbers and new infections continue to grow at an alarming rate. And once again it's confirming the simple fact that we won't be able to solve the economic crisis without a rigorous public health approach. Despite the Administration's propaganda that their response should be 'a cause for celebration,' despite President Trump's request that we should slow down testing, because he thinks it makes him look bad, COVID-19 is still here. A daily threat to American health and prosperity. It did not have to be this way. Month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us. Month after month, as many of us urged him to step up and do his job, he failed us. Just look at the record. In January, I sounded the alarm over the coronavirus outbreak. Trump told the country that he had COVID-19 'totally under control' and that everything would all 'work out well.' In February, I warned about our failure to get information we needed from the Chinese government. I said if I were President, I would demand it. Trump said we were in 'great shape' and reported that China's president said it was 'doing very well.' In March, I set forth a detailed plan for 500 federally-funded testing sites across the country as well as guaranteed emergency paid leave. And later that month, I called for the full and immediate use of the Defense Production Act to deliver critical supplies. Trump accused health care workers of stealing masks. In April, I released plans to secure the supply chain for personal protective equipment, surge nationwide testing through a Pandemic Testing Board, and launch a nationwide health corps to focus on contact tracing. Trump's suggestion? Americans should inject disinfectants into their bodies. In May, I condemned the false choice between preserving our public health and our economy. I urged the Administration to focus on the basic public health measures like testing that would enable us to sustain our economic recovery. Trump's response? He pushed for reopening without regard for safety and called testing 'frankly overrated.' This month, I outlined a path to reopen our country safely and sustainably. It provided workers, small businesses, schools, and state and local governments the tools, resources, and guidance they would need. Trump's proposal? He set a cutoff date for federal funding for testing sites in several states, and actually went to court to take health care away from millions. And now, Donald Trump is in retreat. Remember back in March when he called himself a wartime president? Remember when he exhorted the nation to 'sacrifice together' to face an 'invisible enemy'? What happened? Now it's almost July and it seems the wartime president has surrendered , has waved the white flag and left the field of battle. Today we're facing a serious threat, and we must meet it , as one country. But this President gives us no direction. He pits us against one another. We can't continue on like this , half recovering and half getting worse. We can't continue , half wearing masks and half rejecting science We can't continue , half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We won't defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach , lifting restrictions prematurely, increasing the volatility of the crisis, and raising the likelihood of needing to re-impose restrictions. Until our science catches up to our reality , until we have better treatments for those who become infected and ultimately a safe, proven, widely available vaccine , we have to continue to do all we can as a people and as a government to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.

MEJB27202043	Joe Biden	2020-07-02	My Remarks on the Economic Crisis and Jobs Report	Good morning , today we learned the latest jobs numbers. Like every American, I’m glad that millions of American workers are back on payrolls and that this historic unemployment we still face has at least come down a bit more.This is a good day for every one of those individuals and families who regained their security.But as happy as I was for millions of workers returning to their jobs , there is one number I was stunned that the president didn’t mention even once at his press conference.That number was 50,000.Yesterday, the number of new COVID-19 cases in America topped 50,000 in a single day. We’ve never hit that number before in the course of this virus. In 45 states, the 7-day average of infections are higher than they were a week ago. In some places, hospital ICUs are at or nearing capacity. And we are seeing all across the country spikes in the virus that are causing many states to impose new restrictions again.To me, and to many Americans, this is a very worrisome turn in the path and severity of the virus. And the president didn’t even address it.Yesterday he reiterated his belief that the virus was going to disappear.Today he described what was happening as “fires” flaring up in the country. That’s just not an honest assessment of what is happening. And it’s not just me saying that , the rest of the world knows it too.Just this week, 27 European countries have banned Americans from traveling there because of the surging numbers of COVID-19 in the U.S. and until this president faces what’s going on in our country, our economy will remain at risk.Today’s report is positive news, and I’m thankful for it.But make no mistake: we are still in a deep, deep jobs hole because Donald Trump has so badly bungled the response to the coronavirus, and now has basically given up responding at all.Millions more Americans would still have their jobs today if Donald Trump had done his job. And many of the jobs that have now come back should never have been lost in the first place.And for everyone whose job hasn’t come back , for everyone who doesn’t own stock, or who can’t get a sweetheart loan through connections , does this feel like victory?For parents who are worried their kids can’t go back to school in the Fall, do you feel like this is “mission accomplished”?And for people in states where COVID-19 is spiking, and we’re seeing record-high numbers of infections , do you feel like this crisis is under control?Of course not. People are scared. They’re worried about their families and for the future.But, just like last month, President Trump has spiked the ball and made this about him. He doesn’t seem to realize he’s not even to the 50-yard line.Only one-third of the jobs that were lost in March and April have now come back , and most of the jobs that returned were for people on temporary furlough.That means these were the easiest jobs to get back as we re-open cities and states.It’s only going to get harder from here.Permanent job loss numbers actually went up by 588,000 , to almost 3 million.President Trump touted the job gains for African American workers. But unemployment for black men actually rose , from 15.5 percent in May to 16.3 percent in June.He touted the numbers for Latino unemployment , but those numbers are still more than three times higher than they were before this crisis started.And let’s not lose sight of a critical point. Treport measures job gains as of June 12.In the days since, we’ve seen cases spiking, some businesses have to close down again, some states reimposing restrictions.And, in the last two weeks, we’ve seen almost 3 million new unemployment filings, and another 1.7 million people seek special pandemic unemployment insurance.There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better.Millions of Americans who are still out of work, wondering when or if their job will come back, and worried about how to pay the bills in the meantime.Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved. He’s deadly wrong , on both fronts. We’re already at more than 128,000 dead , and that number keeps climbing. That’s a direct consequence of Donald Trump’s bungled leadership and total mismanagement of this crisis from the start. His failure to take quick action made this pandemic more costly for the American people in every way , in lives lost, in economic impact, in the emotional toll of living with so much doubt and uncertainty. And now , as I said on Tuesday , he’s surrendered to this virus. Other countries have figured out how to get the virus under control, re-open their economies, and put their people back to work. Other leaders didn’t waste the time they were given from stay at home orders , they got to work solving the root cause of this crisis , the coronavirus. Donald Trump’s just given up. He’s not even trying to secure our public health anymore. He’d rather get back to his campaign rallies. He’s not interested in uniting us to fight our common threat. He’s decided he has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes. Without a uniform plan, and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their re-opening plans, this is going to continue to be worse than it would otherwise be. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed real empathy for the families who will never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers, help working families find child care, and extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out tax-payer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on Black and Brown and Native communities , much less done anything to address these health disparities or the underlying systemic racism that shapes them? Of course not. That would require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interests. It didn’t have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our health care workers are still rationing personal protective equipment. We still don’t have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence.President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And just yesterday, he was once more claiming that the coronavirus would “just disappear, I hope.” It’s like deja vu all over again. We’re months into this crisis and that’s still your best answer? Quit hoping for the best, Mr. President.Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million Americans still out of work because of this crisis.Quit ignoring the reality of this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life.Act. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-remarks-on-the-economic-crisis-and-jobs-report-644dc30a3f62?source=user_profile---------46----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good morning , today we learned the latest jobs numbers.

Other leaders didn't waste the time they were given from stay at home orders , they got to work solving the root cause of this crisis , the coronavirus. Donald Trump's just given up. He's not even trying to secure our public health anymore. He'd rather get back to his campaign rallies. He's not interested in uniting us to fight our common threat. He's decided he has more to gain by dividing this country for his own political purposes. Without a uniform plan, and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their re-opening plans, this is going to continue to be worse than it would otherwise be. Recovery will be slower. Unemployment will stay higher than it should be. Has he even once expressed real empathy for the families who will never again be whole because of this virus? Has he done anything real to prioritize support for working Americans who need help now? Democrats in Congress have put forward legislation to reward and protect our brave frontline workers, help working families find child care, and extend the supplemental unemployment benefits for people for the duration of the economic crisis. Meanwhile Republicans and President Trump are stalling on support for working families, even as they dole out tax-payer money to big corporations with zero accountability. Has Donald Trump even acknowledged the disproportionate impact this disease is having on Black and Brown and Native communities , much less done anything to address these health disparities or the underlying systemic racism that shapes them? Of course not. That would require him to step up and lead. It would require him to put the American people ahead of his own interests. It didn't have to be like this. America has more reported deaths and infections than anywhere else in the world. Our health care workers are still rationing personal protective equipment. We still don't have sufficient testing to allow people to return to work with confidence.President Trump has turned wearing a mask into a political statement. And just yesterday, he was once more claiming that the coronavirus would 'just disappear, I hope.' It's like deja vu all over again. We're months into this crisis and that's still your best answer? Quit hoping for the best, Mr. President.Quit claiming victory with almost 15 million Americans still out of work because of this crisis.Quit ignoring the reality of this pandemic and the horrifying loss of American life.Act. Lead. Or get out of the way so others can.

MEJB97202041	Joe Biden	2020-07-09	The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here’s how we’ll do it:	“Build Back Better” Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvani.Thank you. It’s great to be back in Scranton. It’s great to be back in Dunmore. And it’s great to be back home. I want to thank Bob and everyone here at McGregor Industries for showing me around this morning. This is the kind of small manufacturing business that demonstrates the resilience, creativity, and staying-power of America’s industrial base. We’re living through a time unlike any in American history. Our country is facing three crises simultaneously. A pandemic that has infected over 3 million Americans and cost more than 130,000 lives , and shows no signs of slowing down. An economic crisis that has left almost 18 million Americans out of work , with some of the greatest pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And a national reckoning on the issue of racial injustice that has long plagued our country. These come on top of widening economic inequality and a mounting climate crisis. Each of these is an enormous challenge that is testing our strength, our patience, our resilience, our commitment to our core values, and our commitment to one another. But each of these is also a tremendous opportunity for our nation. An opportunity to prepare now for the future threats we know are rising around the world. An opportunity to address the fundamental inequities in our nation , the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else. And an opportunity to finally , and fully , live up to the words and the values enshrined in the founding documents of this nation. That we are all created equal and are entitled to be treated equally throughout our lives. We all know the stakes couldn’t be higher. That’s why this is no time for divisive politics. Donald Trump may believe in pitting Americans against Americans. I don’t. We have a health crisis. An economic crisis. A racial justice crisis. A climate crisis. And we need to come together as Americans to solve them. This is our moment to imagine and to build a new American economy for our families and the next generation. An economy where every American gets a fair return for their work , and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy that is more powerful precisely because everyone is cut in on the deal. An economy that says investing in the American people and working families is more important than the nearly $2 trillion dollar tax break Trump predominantly handed out to the richest Americans. Donald Trump loves to talk and talk and talk. But after three and a half years of big promises, what do the American people have to show for it? He promised a health care plan , but he never even offered his own bill. Instead he fought repeatedly to take health care away from tens of millions. He promised an infrastructure plan and never delivered. He promised to bring back jobs, but manufacturing was in recession even before COVID-19. He promised to buy American, but he let federal contractors double the rate of offshoring jobs in his first 18 months in office. And when it comes to COVID-19, after months of doing nothing other than predicting the virus would disappear , Trump has simply given up. He’s waved the white flag and walked away. And his failures come with a terrible human cost and a deep economic toll. Time and time again, working families are paying the price for Donald Trump’s incompetence. Small business has ended up with the short end of the stick, too. Less than a third of the massive amount of money the Congress and the Federal Reserve made available to the private sector has gone to Main Street businesses. Big business , the wealthy , Trump’s cronies and pals , they’ve been the big winners, again. The truth is, throughout this crisis, Donald Trump has been almost singularly focused on the stock market the Dow the NASDAQ not you not your families. But if I’m elected president, I will be laser-focused on working families and the middle class , not the wealthy investor class. And this will be my guiding principle: We will reward hard work , not excessive wealth. You see, growing up rich and looking down on people is very different from how I grew up here in Scranton. Here, nobody thought Wall Street bankers and CEOs built this country. You could just look around your neighborhood , or your kitchen table , and see who built this country. It was at my grandfather Finnegan’s kitchen table that I learned money doesn’t determine your worth. He’d say: Joey, no one in the world is more worthy than you , and everyone is your equal. My dad taught me: A job is about a lot more than a paycheck , it’s about dignity, respect, your place in the community. And I remember my uncle saying, “Joey, you’re labor from belt buckle to shoe sole” , and I took pride in it. Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work. And for the people who do it. Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton. And those are the values I’ll take with me into the Oval Office. I’ll give more help to Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs and ask more of corporate America. Nearly half the jobs in America are in small businesses. And even back in early May, some estimates found that more than 100,000 small businesses had been permanently shut down. More have closed since. It’s been devastating. Enough. Enough. It’s time to reverse the priorities in this country. Let’s help small businesses manage through this pandemic and recover , and let’s help millions of would-be entrepreneurs get out from under their debts so they can start a business. And it’s time corporate America paid their fair share in taxes. The days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income taxes should be over. Let’s make sure their workers have more power and a voice. It’s way past time we put an end to this era of shareholder capitalism. The idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders is an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their community and their country. That isn’t a new or radical notion. Those are the basic values and principles , that helped build this nation. Now the challenge is to take those fundamental values , and apply them to the new economy we have to build in the years ahead. I call my plan to do it the “Build Back Better” plan. It’s bold. It’s practical. It’s focused on building the economy of the future, not the past. And it responds to five truths laid bare in this moment of crisis. First, we’ve seen in the course of this pandemic the need to strengthen our industrial base as a long-term source of middle class job creation. Let’s use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is Made In America , and in all of America. I do not accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can’t keep well-paid union jobs here in America , and create more of them. I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. So today, I’m releasing a detailed blueprint for how we create millions of good-paying union jobs building the products and technologies we will need now and in the future. It starts with a pretty basic idea: when we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. My plan would tighten the rules to make this a reality. And it goes further. During my first term alone, we’ll invest $400 billion to purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize our infrastructure, to replenish our critical stockpiles, and to enhance our national security. These funds will provide a reliable, predictable demand for products made by American workers and supply chains of American small businesses. We’ll purchase clean energy technologies to fight climate change; building materials, including steel products like those produced here; stockpiles of critical goods and equipment; and advanced technologies to modernize our government and enhance our national security. To ensure the future is made in America, we need to win not just the jobs of today , but the jobs and industries of tomorrow. That means fighting unfair trade practices and curbing the theft of American intellectual property by countries like China. America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. That’s why I am proposing a dramatic Research & Development investment , $300 billion in my first four years alone , to sharpen America’s competitive edge in new industries where global leadership is up for grabs, like battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and clean energy. And this money will be used purposefully to ensure all of America is in on the deal , including communities that have historically been left out , Black, Brown, and Native American entrepreneurs, cities and towns in every region of the country. All told, this will be a mobilization of R&D and procurement investments in ways not seen since World War II. In addition to bringing back the jobs that have been lost this year, my plan will help create at least five million new jobs , good paying jobs , in manufacturing and innovation right here in the United States. Second, we’ve seen the importance of a more resilient economy for the long-term. Our president wasn’t prepared for the pandemic. He ignored the detailed briefings and warnings about the threat of pandemics that we gave to his administration in the transition. He shut down the pandemic office we had in the White House. He praised the Chinese government even as the virus was coming to our shores because he was so afraid they would walk away from his trade deal. Let’s not get caught flat-footed again. Let’s get prepared to meet the accelerating climate crisis. That means investing in infrastructure and clean energy and creating millions of good-paying union jobs in the process. Next week, I’ll be laying out an updated blueprint for how we build a modern, safe, sustainable infrastructure and clean energy economy , how we make sure the communities who have suffered the most from pollution are first to benefit from this investment , and how to strengthen the union movement, by making sure that unions are building America, just like they built the middle class. Third, we’ve seen in this pandemic the immense burdens working parents, and especially women, are carrying as they try to work and care for their children or their aging parents or their loved ones with disabilities. It’s been especially hard in this crisis , but let’s face it, it’s always hard. So let’s make it easier to afford child care and care for aging relatives. And let’s offer more pay and more economic dignity for the millions of workers , often women, and women of color , who we entrust to help teach our youngest and care for our oldest loved ones. Donald Trump has no idea what it is to be a single parent who’s barely getting by but needs to find child care. He hasn’t a clue what it’s like to provide care for an aging parent. That’s understandable. But it’s unconscionable that he doesn’t even really try to empathize with those who are struggling. Like a lot of you, I understand it personally. I know how hard it is to be a single dad who has to work with two young sons at home. I know what it means to bring your aging parent into your home to take care of them in their final years. I’ve done both. And it’s hard. And it’s hard for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. In the weeks ahead, I’ll be laying out a plan to mobilize American talent and hearts to build a 21st century caregiving and education workforce. Fourth, we’ve seen millions of American workers and small business owners put their lives on the line to keep our country going. We need to treat these folks and their families as essential not just in times of crisis , but at all times. Maybe Donald Trump can look those grocery store workers in the eye and tell them they’re not worth $15 an hour, or spend time with frontline workers and then tell them they shouldn’t have the right to organize for better pay, paid leave, benefits, and working conditions. Maybe he can. But I can’t. And I won’t. It’s not enough to just praise these workers. We need to pay them. And let’s finish the job of Obamacare by ensuring everyone has access to quality affordable health care. Let’s lower the cost of prescription drugs, stop the surprise bills, and provide a public option to cover the millions of Americans without care. Let’s make sure everyone has access to a good education regardless of their zip code. Let’s triple the amount of money we direct to Title 1 schools in America. You’ve got 18 Title 1 schools here in Scranton and Dunmore. Imagine how big a difference that will make. I think because of this pandemic, everyone has a renewed appreciation for just how hard our teachers work and how important their job is , let’s give them the resources and support they need to both get through this crisis and to empower the next generation of American ground- breakers. Let’s pay them. Finally, we’ve seen with horrifying clarity the costs of systemic racism in America. We need a comprehensive agenda for racial equity in this country. This isn’t just about police reform. It’s about dealing with the deep wound of systemic racism in this nation. So, we need a dedicated agenda to close the wealth gap, to expand affordable housing, to invest in Black, Brown, AAPI and Native American entrepreneurs, and to make real the promise of educational opportunity. For too long the battle for racial equity has divided America , when it should unite us. Donald Trump cynically claims that he is defending America’s heritage by embracing a flag and public monuments to people who tried to permanently rip this nation apart. Do you think Trump has any idea that 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought on the side of the Union to defeat that flag , including more Black soldiers than any other state. Do you think he has any clue that 33,000 Pennsylvanians died in the Civil War fighting against everything that flag stood for. I see a different America than Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity and justice. The challenges we face today are among the biggest in our history. We have to come together as a country to solve them , there is no other way. I have long said that America is at its best when we are one people, one nation, One America. That’s the tragedy of Donald Trump being our president today. He is exactly the wrong person to lead us at this moment. He will not bring this country together. He is determined to drive us apart. He will not be a president for all the people. He believes he was elected to represent only his base. He will not appeal to the best in us. He is determined to stoke and revive the worst moments from our past. I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is for our country. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others. I know the history and the heart of this country. And given the chance , just a chance , ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. They have never, ever, ever let their country down. And they won’t let the country down now. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. So we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing , not a single thing , we have ever failed to do. When we’ve done it together. Thank you.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/the-future-must-be-made-in-america-by-all-of-america-heres-how-we-ll-do-it-4b21e67aaba1?source=user_profile---------43----------------------------	EmptySummary					'Build Back Better' Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President Joe Biden in Dunmore, Pennsylvani.Thank you.

This isn't just about police reform. It's about dealing with the deep wound of systemic racism in this nation. So, we need a dedicated agenda to close the wealth gap, to expand affordable housing, to invest in Black, Brown, AAPI and Native American entrepreneurs, and to make real the promise of educational opportunity. For too long the battle for racial equity has divided America , when it should unite us. Donald Trump cynically claims that he is defending America's heritage by embracing a flag and public monuments to people who tried to permanently rip this nation apart. Do you think Trump has any idea that 360,000 Pennsylvanians fought on the side of the Union to defeat that flag , including more Black soldiers than any other state. Do you think he has any clue that 33,000 Pennsylvanians died in the Civil War fighting against everything that flag stood for. I see a different America than Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity and justice. The challenges we face today are among the biggest in our history. We have to come together as a country to solve them , there is no other way. I have long said that America is at its best when we are one people, one nation, One America. That's the tragedy of Donald Trump being our president today. He is exactly the wrong person to lead us at this moment. He will not bring this country together. He is determined to drive us apart. He will not be a president for all the people. He believes he was elected to represent only his base. He will not appeal to the best in us. He is determined to stoke and revive the worst moments from our past. I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is for our country. But I'm optimistic for one reason above all others. I know the history and the heart of this country. And given the chance , just a chance , ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things. They have never, ever, ever let their country down. And they won't let the country down now. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. So we just need to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. And there is nothing , not a single thing , we have ever failed to do. When we've done it together. Thank you.
MEJB147202037	Joe Biden	2020-07-14	We’re Going To Build Back Better and Create a Clean Energy Future	Good afternoon. Yes, I’m here today to talk about infrastructure, jobs, and our clean energy future. But I have to start by speaking to what millions of Americans know when they wake up every morning with more worry, anxiety, and fear , we are still a country in crisis. This pandemic has infected more than 3 million Americans. It has cost more than 135,000 lives , and it shows no signs of slowing down. In just the last few days, 19 states reported record cases, including Florida, which saw more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. Hospitalizations and deaths , two of the most concerning indicators of Trump’s failed response , are already unacceptably high, and they’re rising. It’s gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public. I’m glad he made that shift , but it’s not enough, Mr. President.We won’t be able to turn the corner and get the American people back to work safely without presidential leadership. “Open everything now” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan. Quit pushing the false choice between protecting our health and protecting our economy. All that does is endanger our recovery on both fronts. Please listen to your own public health experts instead of denigrating them. Do your job, Mr. President. Because if we can’t deal with the public health crisis, we can’t deal with the economic crisis or deal with almost 18 million Americans who are out of work, and the incredible pain inflicted on small businesses and communities of color. And we can’t deal with the climate crisis that could cast an even darker and more permanent shadow over our country and the world. And we won’t be able to do what America has always done , come back stronger than everwith grit, toughness, and resilience That’s what I want to talk about today. Last week, I shared the outlines of my plan to Build Back Better , a bold plan to build an economy of the future, not the past. The first plank of the plan rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can’t ensure our future is Made in America, with good-paying union jobs here at home. We clearly can. But today, I’m here in Wilmington to talk about the second plank , how we can create millions of high-quality, union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future. These are the most critical investments we can make for the long-term health and vitality of the American economy and the safety of the American people. Even if we weren’t facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments. One in five miles of our highways are still in “poor condition.” Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair. Tens of millions of Americans lack access to high-speed broadband. To get our people to work and our kids to school safely, to get our goods to market swiftly, and to power a clean energy revolution in this country, we need to modernize America’s infrastructure.Despite this overwhelming need, this President and Republicans in Congress have simply failed to act. They continue to break promises to the American people. Donald Trump promised a big infrastructure bill when he ran in 2016. He promised it again in 2017 and in 2018 and in 2019. And he’s promising one again. Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff , or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration and political apparatus , the White House announces it’s “Infrastructure Week.” But he’s never delivered. Never even really tried. Well, I know how to get it done. In 2009, President Obama and I inherited an economy in free fall, and we prevented another Great Depression. We enacted the largest infrastructure plan since President Eisenhower’s interstate highway system, not only generating jobs, but improving the safety of our roads. We made the largest investment in clean energy in history , 90 billion dollars. It put us on a path toward a thriving clean energy economy, powering new economic growth and reducing energy costs. Here we are now with the economy in crisis, but with an incredible opportunity not just to build back to where we were before, but better, stronger, more resilient, and more prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. And there is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in this next decade , than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival. That’s not up for dispute, Mr. President. When Donald Trump thinks about climate change , he can muster is one word: “hoax.” When I think about climate change , I think of a word as well: “jobs.” Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work: making the air cleaner for our kids to breathe, restoring our crumbling roads and bridges and ports, and making it faster, cheaper, and cleaner to transport American-made goods all across this country, and around the world. Jobs to build and install a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country, which will not only help the American auto industry lead the world in manufacturing electric vehicles, it will save working families money on gas. Jobs to lay the lines for the second great railroad revolution, which will not only slash pollution , it will slash commute times and open up investment in areas connected to metropolitan centers for the first time. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer. When I think about those wind-farms, I see American manufacturing , and American workers , racing to dominate the global market. I see the steel that will be needed , for the windmill platforms and towers and ladders that could be made by small manufacturers like McGregor Industries, where I visited last week. And I see the union-trained and certified men and women who will manufacture and install it all. I see the ports that will come back to life , the longshoremen, and the ship builders, and the communities they support. When Donald Trump thinks about improving energy efficiency by retrofitting lighting systems with LED bulbs, you want to know what he says? He says he doesn’t like LEDs because: the light’s no good. I always look orange.” When I think about energy retrofitting for lighting, I see incredible projects like the one here at the Chase Center. I see the small businesses like Preferred Electric that design and install award-winning energy conservation measures that reduce the consumption of electricity and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. I see the master electricians and union workers who went through union apprenticeships , who start off with good wages and quality benefits that only grow from there. These investments will be a win-win-win for this country. Creating jobs. Cutting energy costsbills. Protecting our climate. That’s why today I’m releasing my plan to mobilize millions of jobs by building sustainable infrastructure and an equitable clean energy future. In my first four years, we’re going to give 4 million buildings all across the country the same energy make-over that the Chase Center got. It’s going to create at least one million jobs in construction, engineering and manufacturing to get it done. It’s going to make the places where we live, work, and learn healthier, improving indoor air quality and water quality, and it’s going to save tens of billions of dollars of energy costs over time. But we’re not just going to focus on commercial space, we’re going to give direct support to help families do the same thing for their homes. We’re going offer cash rebates and low-cost financing to upgrade energy inefficient appliances and windows , improvements that will also cut their monthly energy bills. And we’re going to make a major investment to build 1.5 million new energy-efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities three-times over: by alleviating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership.Last week I talked about using the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing , that’s what we’re going to do with the American auto industry as well. The United States owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles , and we’re going to convert those government fleets to electric vehicles , made and sourced right here in the United States of America.With the government providing the demand and the grants to re-tool factories that are struggling to compete, the U.S. auto industry and its deep bench of suppliers will step up , expanding capacity so that the United States , not China , leads the world in clean vehicle production. And we’re going to make it easier for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles too. Not only by building those 500,000 charging stations, but by offering rebates and incentives to swap older, fuel inefficient vehicles for new, clean, American-made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil annually. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the American auto industry, its supply chains, and the associated infrastructure. We also know that transforming the American electricity sector to produce power without also producing carbon pollution , and electrifying an increasing share of our economy , will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century. That’s why we are going to achieve a carbon-pollution free electricity sector by 2035. And we need to get to work right away. We’ll need scientists at national labs and land-grant universities and HBCUs to improve and innovate the technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electricity. We’ll need engineers to design them and workers to manufacture them. We’ll need iron workers and welders to install them. And we’ll become the world’s largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs. We know how to do this. Our administration rescued the auto industry and helped them retool, made solar energy the same cost as traditional energy, weatherized more than a million homes , and we will do it again , bigger and faster and smarter. And, as we do this work, we need to be mindful of the historic wrongs and the damage that America’s industrial rise in the 20th century inflicted on the environment in poor and vulnerable communities , so often Black, Brown, and Native American communities. Polluted air. Polluted water. Toxins raining down on communities that bore the environmental and health burdens, but shared none of the profits. Growing up, breathing that in every day , it’s poison. That’s partly why there are such incredible rates of childhood asthma in Black and Brown communities. Why Black Americans are almost three times more likely to die of asthma-related causes than white Americans. It’s “Cancer Alley” in St. James Parish in Louisiana. And it’s the cancer clusters along Route 9 here in Delaware. And that’s why, today, I’m also releasing a slate of environmental justice policies that build on my existing plan. This is an area of incredible opportunity for economic growth for our country , but we have to make sure that the first people to benefit are those who have been hurt the most by centuries of structural disparities. I’m setting a goal of making sure that these frontline and fenceline communities, whether in rural places or in city centers, receive 40 percent of the benefits from the investments we’re making , in housing, in pollution reduction, in workforce development, in transportation , across the board. And we’re also going to create jobs for people by cleaning up the environmental hazards that have now been abandoned. More than a quarter million jobs , right away , to do things like plug the millions of abandoned oil and gas wells that exist all across this country, posing a daily threat to the health and safety of our communities. And we’re going to hold accountable those CEOs and corporations that benefited from decades of subsidies , then just walked away from their responsibilities to these communities , leaving wells to leak dangerous pollutants and greenhouse gasses into the air and water. And we’re not only going to repeal those subsidies, we’re going to go after those golden parachutes the CEOs gave themselves before declaring bankruptcy, and make sure workers receive the benefits and retirements they were promised. Let’s create new markets for our family farmers and ranchers , and a new, modern day Civilian Climate Corps to heal our public lands and make us less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. These aren’t pie-in-the-sky dreams. They’re actionable policies that we can get to work on right away. We can live up to our responsibilities, meet the challenges of a world at risk of a climate catastrophe, build more climate-resilient communities, put millions of skilled workers on the job, and make life markedly better and safer for the American people all at once. The alternative , to ignore the facts, to deny reality, to focus only on the technology of the last century, instead of inventing the technologies that will define this century , it’s just plain un-American. That is all that Donald Trump and the Republicans offer: Backward-looking politics that will harm the environment, make communities less healthy, and hold back economic progress while other countries race ahead. It’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate, and to win. And it will extract a deadly cost. I know better. And I know you do, as well. I know what the American people are capable of. I know what American workers can accomplish when given the room to run. I know that climate change is the challenge that’s going to define our American future , and I know meeting this challenge will be a once-in-a-century opportunity to jolt new life into our economy, strengthen our global leadership, and protect our planet for future generations. And, if I have the honor of being elected President, we’re not just going to tinker around the edges.We’re going to make historic investments that will seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history. We’re going to get to work delivering results right away , on day one. We’re going to reverse Trump’s roll backs of 100 public health and environmental rules , and then forge a path to greater ambition. We’re going to get back into the Paris Agreement , and back into the business of leading the world. And we’re going to lock-in progress that no future president can roll back or undercut to take us backwards again. Science requires a timeline for measurable progress on climate that isn’t three decades or even two. Science tells us we will only have nine years to act before the damage is irreversible. So my timeline for results is my first four years as president , the jobs we’ll create, the investments we’ll make, and the irreversible steps we’ll take to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to put our nation on the road to net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.So let’s not waste any more time. Let’s get to work. Thank you.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/were-going-to-build-back-better-and-create-a-clean-energy-future-a636131d57ba?source=user_profile---------39----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon.

MEJB187202036	Joe Biden	2020-07-18	Statement by Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden on the Passing of Congressman John Lewis	We are made in the image of God, and then there is John Lewis.How could someone in flesh and blood be so courageous, so full of hope and love in the face of so much hate, violence, and vengeance? Perhaps it was the Spirit that found John as a young boy in the Deep South dreaming of preaching the social gospel; the work ethic his sharecropper parents instilled in him and that stayed with him; the convictions of nonviolent civil disobedience he mastered from Dr. King and countless fearless leaders in the movement; or the abiding connection with the constituents of Georgia’s 5th District he loyally served for decades.Or perhaps it was that he was truly a one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march.It is rare to meet and befriend our heroes. John was that hero for so many people of every race and station, including us. He absorbed the force of human nature’s cruelty during the course of his life, and the only thing that could finally stop him was cancer. But he was not bitter. We spoke to him a few days ago for the final time. His voice still commanded respect and his laugh was still full of joy. Instead of answering our concerns for him, he asked about us. He asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. He was himself , a man at peace, of dignity, grace and character.John’s life reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation , that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally. Through the beatings, the marches, the arrests, the debates on war, peace, and freedom, and the legislative fights for good jobs and health care and the fundamental right to vote, he taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.That is the charge a great American and humble man of God has left us. For parents trying to answer their children’s questions about what to make of the world we are in today, teach them about John Lewis. For the peaceful marchers for racial and economic justice around the world who are asking where we go from here, follow his lead. For his fellow legislators, govern by your conscience like he did, not for power or party.

Perhaps it was the Spirit that found John as a young boy in the Deep South dreaming of preaching the social gospel; the work ethic his sharecropper parents instilled in him and that stayed with him; the convictions of nonviolent civil disobedience he mastered from Dr. King and countless fearless leaders in the movement; or the abiding connection with the constituents of Georgia's 5th District he loyally served for decades.Or perhaps it was that he was truly a one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march.It is rare to meet and befriend our heroes. John was that hero for so many people of every race and station, including us. He absorbed the force of human nature's cruelty during the course of his life, and the only thing that could finally stop him was cancer. But he was not bitter. We spoke to him a few days ago for the final time. His voice still commanded respect and his laugh was still full of joy. Instead of answering our concerns for him, he asked about us. He asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. He was himself , a man at peace, of dignity, grace and character.John's life reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation , that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally. Through the beatings, the marches, the arrests, the debates on war, peace, and freedom, and the legislative fights for good jobs and health care and the fundamental right to vote, he taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.That is the charge a great American and humble man of God has left us. For parents trying to answer their children's questions about what to make of the world we are in today, teach them about John Lewis. For the peaceful marchers for racial and economic justice around the world who are asking where we go from here, follow his lead. For his fellow legislators, govern by your conscience like he did, not for power or party. He was our bridge , to our history so we did not forget its pain and to our future so we never lose our hope.To John's son, John Miles, and to his family, friends, staff, and constituents, we send you our love and prayers. Thank you for sharing him with the nation and the world.And to John, march on, dear friend. May God bless you. May you reunite with your beloved Lillian.

MEJB197202035	Joe Biden	2020-07-19	My Statement on Donald Trump’s Continued Failure to Control COVID-19	Yet again this morning, President Trump attacked the CDC and the public health experts who should be guiding our response to COVID-19, saying that they “don’t know” what they’re talking about.The past six months have proven again and again that it’s Donald Trump who doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to COVID-19. He said the virus would disappear. He said anyone who wants a test could get a test. He said the virus was under control. When it comes to the coronavirus, you can’t believe a word he says.It’s astonishing that even after 140,000 Americans have died in the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the developed world, President Trump continues his offensive against the CDC and scientists like Dr. Fauci, instead of heeding their clear advice about the steps we must take to stop this virus , from ramping up testing to getting protective equipment to the heroes on the front lines.But what’s truly disturbing is that President Trump isn’t just attacking our leading health experts , he’s waving the white flag and actively undercutting our ability to save lives and stop COVID-19 by shamefully trying to block critical additional new funding for the CDC, as well as for testing and tracing. Think about that again: In the middle of a pandemic that continues to worsen on his watch, President Trump is trying to keep money away from the public health measures that we know will keep us and our families safe. He even went on to attack the value of testing again in the same interview, perpetuating a terrible months-long streak.Mr. President, your ignorance isn’t a virtue or a sign of your strength , it’s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it’s costing Americans their jobs and their lives.It’s long past due for President Trump to listen to somebody other than himself in how to fight this virus, because after six straight months of deadly mismanagement it is spiraling even more out of control. He can start by immediately adopting the proposals I have laid out for months now that experts tell us will help us stop this virus, save lives, and safely re-open our economy.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-donald-trumps-continued-failure-to-control-covid-19-1d0bddb9504f?source=user_profile---------37----------------------------	EmptySummary					Yet again this morning, President Trump attacked the CDC and the public health experts who should be guiding our response to COVID-19, saying that they 'don't know' what they're talking about.The past six months have proven again and again that it's Donald Trump who doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to COVID-19.

MEJB207202034	Joe Biden	2020-07-20	My Statement on Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections	Foreign interference in the U.S. electoral process represents an assault on the American people and their constitutional right to vote. When foreign states direct hackers, trolls, money launderers, and misinformation to subvert or cast doubt on our elections, they threaten America’s sovereignty, democratic institutions, and national security. They undermine the vote and the voice of every U.S. citizen. They attack our very way of life.The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has concluded that the Kremlin’s interference in past elections represented “only the latest installment in an increasingly brazen interference by the Kremlin on the citizens and democratic institutions of the United States.” Despite the exposure of Russia’s malign activities by the U.S. Intelligence Community, law enforcement agencies, and bipartisan Congressional committees, the Kremlin has not halted its efforts to interfere in our democracy. In Senate testimony on July 23 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Russia was “absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections.” And on March 27, 2020, the State Department held a briefing describing how Russia was recklessly spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia is not the only foreign actor seeking to interfere in our democracy. Increasingly, other states have shown an interest in copying Russia’s tactics.Congress passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017. The Trump administration has thus far failed to make adequate use of these authorities to counter and deter foreign election interference. Instead, President Trump has repeatedly denied that Russia interfered in our elections, most egregiously during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018.In spite of President Trump’s failure to act, America’s adversaries must not misjudge the resolve of the American people to counter every effort by a foreign power to interfere in our democracy, whether by hacking voting systems and databases, laundering money into our political system, systematically spreading disinformation, or trying to sow doubt about the integrity of our elections.That is why, today, I am putting the Kremlin and other foreign governments on notice. If elected president, I will treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation’s government. I will direct the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections. I will direct my administration to leverage all appropriate instruments of national power and make full use of my executive authority to impose substantial and lasting costs on state perpetrators. These costs could include financial-sector sanctions, asset freezes, cyber responses, and the exposure of corruption. A range of other actions could also be taken, depending on the nature of the attack. I will direct our response at a time and in a manner of our choosing.In addition, I will take action where needed to stop attempts to interfere with U.S. elections before they can impact our democratic processes. In particular, I will direct and resource the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Foreign Interference Task Force to develop plans for disrupting foreign threats to our elections process. This will be done, wherever possible, in coordination with our allies and partners, so that we are isolating the regimes that seek to undermine democracies and civil liberties.I have no desire to escalate tensions with Russia or any other country. I would prefer to focus the full energies of my administration on bringing the international community together to fight COVID-19 and the economic pain it has caused, and to tackle other pressing issues of international concern. But if any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-foreign-interference-in-u-s-elections-8b42b4444eb6?source=user_profile---------36----------------------------	EmptySummary					Foreign interference in the U.S. electoral process represents an assault on the American people and their constitutional right to vote.

MEJB217202031	Joe Biden	2020-07-21	We’re Going to Create a 21st Century Care and Early Childhood Education Workforce	Good afternoon.I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program here at the Colwyck Center for hosting us.I just met with Sarah Johnson, and her 3-year-old son, Noah, who is a student here.She said the program does wonders, helping Noah learn his letters and numbers, socialize with other kids, and understand his emotions and develop his personality.But like so many parents, she’s worried.About her job as a dental assistant, and noticing changes in Noah’s behavior since he hasn’t been in school since March. She has had to lean on her parents to help. It’s really tough.But parents like Sarah, and places like this center, and the caregivers and educators who work here , they also give me a lot of hope.That’s why I couldn’t think of a better place to talk about the third plank of my Build Back Better plan for our economy.This one is about easing the squeeze on working families that are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones. And it’s about creating jobs with better pay and career pathways for caregivers, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve.But I know it’s hard to think of that future when you’re just trying to get through the crisis at hand.I know that’s the case for child care facilities across the country.They’ve had to close their doors and layoff staff. They’re not getting the protective equipment they need as they reopen.In virus hotspots, they can’t reopen at all.We are in a child care emergency. It didn’t have to be this way. That’s why I’m calling on the President to get these facilities the resources and equipment they need , now.Enough.Each day the pandemic’s death toll grows.Each day, in some states, more people test positive than the day before.Each day too many Americans are still out of work, losing hope.It’s been reported by his own staff that the President is “not really working this anymore. He doesn’t want to be distracted by it.”His own staff admits that Donald Trump fails the most important test of being the American President: the duty to care , for you, for all of us.It’s also been reported that he will block any funding for more testing and tracing in the next COVID-relief bill , just as states report record cases, and hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise.He simply doesn’t understand.We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.He has quit on you and he has quit on this country.But this election is not just about him.It’s about us.It’s about you.And I will do what a President is supposed to do.Care. Lead. And never give up.Over the last two weeks I’ve shared my agenda for economic recovery.I call it Build Back Better, because we can’t just build back to the way things were before. The first plank rejects the defeatist view that automation and globalization mean we can’t ensure American workers lead us to a future Made in America. The second plank helps us outcompete the rest of the world and tackle climate change. It will put millions of Americans to work in good union jobs, modernizing our infrastructure while building a clean energy future.Today, I’m outlining the third plank , mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in this country.If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. Even before the pandemic, millions of working families have faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.It’s the sandwich generation that includes everyone from an 18-year-old daughter caring for her mother who suddenly gets sick, to a 40-year-old Dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents.The joy and love are always there. But it’s hard. It’s really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially.They need help, but often can’t find it or afford it.And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued.Then the pandemic hits and the squeeze tightens for everyone.Nursing homes have been hit hard.If you’re a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe child care for your kids.Others of you have become unexpected 24/7 caregivers, trying to keep your children safe and learning, while you’re working remotely yourself.Or you’ve had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost.The confusion over schools reopening only makes things worse.And the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home and community care choices that best fit their needs.We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a public health crisis.You’re doing everything you can, but this President is not.If I’m your president, here’s what I would do.First, let’s start with caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and helping them live independently.Here’s an example.Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it.But they are all waiting for that phone call back.For some, the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so that states can clear that waiting list. And to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we will make long-term federal investments.We will have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways that improve home and community care, increase prevention, and reduce costs and hospitalizations.Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals and day programs for seniors, and making their homes safer for them.This builds on an initiative we created under the Affordable Care Act. The very program that this President ceaselessly tries to gut.For example, there’s a pilot program in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, occupational therapist, and a handyman come to a home that’s caring for an aging family member.They might not be able to cure a mother’s Alzheimer’s, but they can make sure she doesn’t break her hip.They walk through the house and install the handrail in the right spot in the bathroom, or fix the door so it doesn’t stick as she tries to open it.An initial trial found that about $3,000 in program costs yielded more than $20,000 in savings.Simple steps that save lives, save money, and provide critical peace of mind.Here’s another example.Whether in rural North Carolina or central Philadelphia, people of color in economically distressed communities face punishing health disparities from systemic discrimination.They don’t have health insurance. They don’t see a doctor. Language is a barrier.They slip through the gaps so their treatable condition turns into a chronic condition.That’s why community health workers are real heroes. They go into these communities and make sure folks are getting the care they need. My plan puts 150,000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country.These are things we can do now.Second, we can also make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible.My child care plan is straightforward.Every 3- and 4-year-old child will get access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center.And low-to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5.The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Here’s how it works.They can either get up to an $8,000 tax credit for child care.For a middle-class family with a couple of young kids spending about $300 a week on child care, that means annual tax savings of $8,000 in their pocket. That means everything to working parents living paycheck to paycheck.Or the federal government would send funding to states, which then work with child care providers to cover the costs for working families with young children over 7% of their income.So, say both parents work and need child care.You go to childcare.gov, which we created under the Obama-Biden Administration, to help you find child care that works for you.Under my plan, it takes you to your state website. Local child centers pop up. You can call or fill in your information. You apply. The state then sends you a letter saying that you’re approved and lays out the amount you’re going to pay. The state sends that information to the child care provider. And then the state reimburses that child care center on the back end.You just pay what you’re supposed to pay , not a dime for some working families and no more than 7% for others.We can do that. This would save families thousands of dollars.And there are other common-sense steps we can take, like expanding a tax credit for businesses to build child care facilities on site, or supporting more after-care, weekend, and summer care for families.Third, as we expand access to caregiving, we need to pay and support our caregivers.They do God’s work, but home health workers aren’t paid much. They have few benefits. Forty-percent are still on SNAP or Medicaid.So my plan is direct.It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much needed raise.No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet.Under my health care plan that defends and expands Obamacare, they will have more affordable health insurance. I will make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain to protect their rights and earned benefits.This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers.For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician’s assistant, or a doctor. Or an early childhood educator can receive the coaching to keep delivering high-quality learning experiences.We can do this.The bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would: save working families time and money, get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need, and put more people to work.It’s a triple win. That keeps seniors in their homes if they choose. That recognizes the realities facing modern families , and provides them much-needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic. Just imagine. We can put 3 million Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. And combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation. This is a fresh, bold way to build up a critical part of our labor force and help us recover faster and stronger.When we usually talk about a jobs package, there is a big push for shovel-ready jobs.But that’s what care jobs are.These workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. Allowing millions of people, primarily women, to get back to work now.It is the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers.And it is the smart thing to do for our economy.Today, millions of our people can’t fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to our caregiving squeeze.That means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our families.It means more disruption for our businesses, and less jobs and growth for our economy.This is both a moral and an economic imperative for our nation.And we pay for it by rolling back unproductive tax cuts for high-income real estate investors while ensuring high-income earners pay their tax bills. We invest those savings of $775 billion over ten years into building our economy back better than before.And tomorrow, I’ll be joining a virtual townhall with SEIU members , home care workers, fast food workers, janitors , to hear directly from them about why this matters so much.Because, you see, this is also about something bigger.It’s about the dignity and respect for working people. And that’s precisely what this election is about, too.The American President has a duty to care for us all.To see people where they are. To understand what they’re going through and where they want to be.I’ve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is.So very, very hard.When Jill and I got married, I saw how difficult it was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom. We cared for our parents to the end, my mom moved in with us.Our entire family was there for our Beau when he died from cancer.We know what so many of you are going through.But now everything just feels different.There’s just that feeling, that sense where you just don’t know if everything will be okay.But I’m here to tell you that it can be , it will be.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man. He never went to college. He got knocked down a few times, but always got up. He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect them to understand my problems.”I understand , to my very core.And I know that together, we can do this.We are America. We don’t settle. We aspire.Let’s get to work.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/were-going-to-create-a-21st-century-care-and-early-childhood-education-workforce-e5fc4c066fbd?source=user_profile---------33----------------------------	EmptySummary					Good afternoon.I want to thank the Colonial Early Education Program here at the Colwyck Center for hosting us.I just met with Sarah Johnson, and her 3-year-old son, Noah, who is a student here.She said the program does wonders, helping Noah learn his letters and numbers, socialize with other kids, and understand his emotions and develop his personality.But like so many parents, she's worried.About her job as a dental assistant, and noticing changes in Noah's behavior since he hasn't been in school since March.

Even before the pandemic, millions of working families have faced enormous financial and personal strains trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.It's the sandwich generation that includes everyone from an 18-year-old daughter caring for her mother who suddenly gets sick, to a 40-year-old Dad raising his child and caring for his own aging parents.The joy and love are always there. But it's hard. It's really, really hard. Families are squeezed emotionally and financially.They need help, but often can't find it or afford it.And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued.Then the pandemic hits and the squeeze tightens for everyone.Nursing homes have been hit hard.If you're a frontline worker, you struggle to find safe child care for your kids.Others of you have become unexpected 24/7 caregivers, trying to keep your children safe and learning, while you're working remotely yourself.Or you've had to put your career on hold indefinitely, or seen your hours cut, or your job lost.The confusion over schools reopening only makes things worse.And the last few months has only underscored how vital it is for families and older Americans to have more home and community care choices that best fit their needs.We are trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a public health crisis.You're doing everything you can, but this President is not.If I'm your president, here's what I would do.First, let's start with caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and helping them live independently.Here's an example.Right now there are 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it.But they are all waiting for that phone call back.For some, the wait is five years. Five years. My plan makes a bold investment so that states can clear that waiting list. And to make sure we ease the financial burden for more families going forward, we will make long-term federal investments.We will have a major innovation fund to allow states to test and expand successful ways that improve home and community care, increase prevention, and reduce costs and hospitalizations.Think of expanded vital services like rides to appointments, meals and day programs for seniors, and making their homes safer for them.This builds on an initiative we created under the Affordable Care Act. The very program that this President ceaselessly tries to gut.For example, there's a pilot program in 27 cities in 16 states where a nurse, occupational therapist, and a handyman come to a home that's caring for an aging family member.They might not be able to cure a mother's Alzheimer's, but they can make sure she doesn't break her hip.They walk through the house and install the handrail in the right spot in the bathroom, or fix the door so it doesn't stick as she tries to open it.An initial trial found that about $3,000 in program costs yielded more than $20,000 in savings.Simple steps that save lives, save money, and provide critical peace of mind.Here's another example.Whether in rural North Carolina or central Philadelphia, people of color in economically distressed communities face punishing health disparities from systemic discrimination.They don't have health insurance. They don't see a doctor. Language is a barrier.They slip through the gaps so their treatable condition turns into a chronic condition.That's why community health workers are real heroes. They go into these communities and make sure folks are getting the care they need. My plan puts 150,000 more of these workers in our communities throughout the country.These are things we can do now.Second, we can also make high-quality child care more affordable and accessible.My child care plan is straightforward.Every 3- and 4-year-old child will get access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center.And low-to middle-income families won't spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5.The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. Here's how it works.They can either get up to an $8,000 tax credit for child care.For a middle-class family with a couple of young kids spending about $300 a week on child care, that means annual tax savings of $8,000 in their pocket. That means everything to working parents living paycheck to paycheck.Or the federal government would send funding to states, which then work with child care providers to cover the costs for working families with young children over 7% of their income.So, say both parents work and need child care.You go to childcare.gov, which we created under the Obama-Biden Administration, to help you find child care that works for you.Under my plan, it takes you to your state website. Local child centers pop up. You can call or fill in your information. You apply. The state then sends you a letter saying that you're approved and lays out the amount you're going to pay. The state sends that information to the child care provider. And then the state reimburses that child care center on the back end.You just pay what you're supposed to pay , not a dime for some working families and no more than 7% for others.We can do that. This would save families thousands of dollars.And there are other common-sense steps we can take, like expanding a tax credit for businesses to build child care facilities on site, or supporting more after-care, weekend, and summer care for families.Third, as we expand access to caregiving, we need to pay and support our caregivers.They do God's work, but home health workers aren't paid much. They have few benefits. Forty-percent are still on SNAP or Medicaid.So my plan is direct.It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much needed raise.No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet.Under my health care plan that defends and expands Obamacare, they will have more affordable health insurance. I will make sure these workers have an effective way to unionize and collectively bargain to protect their rights and earned benefits.This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers.For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician's assistant, or a doctor. Or an early childhood educator can receive the coaching to keep delivering high-quality learning experiences.We can do this.The bottom line is that a mobilized caregiving and early education workforce would: save working families time and money, get their loved ones the care and early childhood education they need, and put more people to work.It's a triple win. That keeps seniors in their homes if they choose. That recognizes the realities facing modern families , and provides them much-needed economic support in the middle of a pandemic. Just imagine. We can put 3 million Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. And combined with my proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, we can free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation. This is a fresh, bold way to build up a critical part of our labor force and help us recover faster and stronger.When we usually talk about a jobs package, there is a big push for shovel-ready jobs.But that's what care jobs are.These workers are ready now. These jobs can be filled now. Allowing millions of people, primarily women, to get back to work now.It is the right thing to do for our families and our most essential workers.And it is the smart thing to do for our economy.Today, millions of our people can't fully pursue the jobs and careers they dream of due to our caregiving squeeze.That means tens of billions of dollars less in wages each year for our families.It means more disruption for our businesses, and less jobs and growth for our economy.This is both a moral and an economic imperative for our nation.And we pay for it by rolling back unproductive tax cuts for high-income real estate investors while ensuring high-income earners pay their tax bills. We invest those savings of $775 billion over ten years into building our economy back better than before.And tomorrow, I'll be joining a virtual townhall with SEIU members , home care workers, fast food workers, janitors , to hear directly from them about why this matters so much.Because, you see, this is also about something bigger.It's about the dignity and respect for working people. And that's precisely what this election is about, too.The American President has a duty to care for us all.To see people where they are. To understand what they're going through and where they want to be.I've been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is.So very, very hard.When Jill and I got married, I saw how difficult it was for her to start her teaching career while being a new mom. We cared for our parents to the end, my mom moved in with us.Our entire family was there for our Beau when he died from cancer.We know what so many of you are going through.But now everything just feels different.There's just that feeling, that sense where you just don't know if everything will be okay.But I'm here to tell you that it can be , it will be.You know, my Dad was an honorable, decent man. He never went to college. He got knocked down a few times, but always got up. He worked hard and built a great middle-class life for our family.He used to say, 'Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect them to understand my problems.'I understand , to my very core.And I know that together, we can do this.We are America. We don't settle. We aspire.Let's get to work.
MEJB217202032	Joe Biden	2020-07-21	The Biden Plan for Mobilizing American Talent and Heart to Create a 21st Century Caregiving and Education Workforce	Joe Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he’s been a single parent. Biden knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for people in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members. People in nursing homes have been hit especially hard by the coronavirus, shining a bright light on the fact that many would prefer to be in a home or community based setting. And, many parents are struggling to find child care while they go to their essential jobs, or find themselves as 24/7 caregivers trying to keep their children safe and learning while working remotely. Other parents are caring for their kids, while worrying about how they will make ends meet after having hours cut or losing their jobs. And, at the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay and benefits. President Trump’s failure to take action to control the coronavirus has worsened all of these challenges facing families across the country. Even before the pandemic, our country was experiencing a caregiving crisis. Some care needs were going untended. Other care needs were filled by Americans serving as unpaid caregivers lacking the financial support or respite care they needed, and sometimes putting their careers on hold. Often, families made caregiving decisions that came with great financial, professional, physical and emotional costs. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately women of color , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. Biden’s economic recovery plan won’t just build back our economy to the way it was before, but build it back better , including by building a robust 21st century caregiving and education workforce. As a first step, Biden will immediately provide states, tribal, and local governments with the fiscal relief they need to keep workers employed and keep vital public services running, including direct care and child care services. Once we are able to move from relief to recovery, Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. These steps will mean families will be able to afford better, more productive care and early education for their loved ones. They will also have a significant jobs impact: This plan, combined with Biden’s proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, will put 3 million Americans to work in new care and education jobs, and increase overall employment by about 5 million after taking into account the economic impacts of increased labor force participation after unpaid caregivers , disproportionately women , are freed up to pursue paid careers if they so choose.Biden will:The plan will cost $775 billion over 10 years and will be paid for by rolling back unproductive and unequal tax breaks for real estate investors with incomes over $400,000 and taking steps to increase tax compliance for high-income earners. This plan builds on Biden’s proposals to support informal caregivers , family members or loved ones who do this work unpaid, including a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers, Social Security credits for people who care for their loved ones, and professional and peer support for caregivers of wounded, injured, or ill active duty service members and veterans. EXPAND ACCESS TO DIGNIFIED CARE FOR OLDER AMERICANS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES Biden will help ease the financial burden on families caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and reduce unnecessary and costly hospitalizations, while providing people who need care with better, more dignified services and supports that meet their specific needs and personal choices. Biden will allocate $450 billion to give more people the choice to receive care at home or in supportive community situations, or to have that choice for their loved ones. He will help states offer cost-effective options for affordable primary and preventive care, and affordable support services like help with meals, transportation, home safety, and quality day programs for older Americans. This commitment will reduce health expenditures, help more Americans avoid unnecessary and expensive hospitalizations, and result in an expansion of the caregiving and community health workforce by roughly 1.5 million jobs. Specifically, Biden will:It is also just too hard to figure out how to get care when you need it. As part of his proposal, Biden will work with states to set up a simpler way for Americans searching for caregiving help to go online, find out what financial support they might be eligible for based on their income, and identify potential caregivers. MAKE HIGH-QUALITY CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND PRESCHOOL UNIVERSAL The pandemic has highlighted what has always been true: child care and early learning are essential to many Americans, providing a nurturing environment for children to learn and grow and allowing parents and guardians the choice to pursue careers and contribute to the economy while supporting their families. The pandemic has also reminded parents around the country just how valuable caregivers and educators are , and how challenging and important their jobs are. Even before the pandemic, millions of parents struggled to find a space for their child in a quality care and educational setting, keeping parents , primarily mothers , out of the workforce or causing them to settle for lower-paying jobs that allowed them time to provide their own child care. And now, many more parents are worrying how they will educate and care for their children while they work, while schools and child care providers are facing extreme financial challenges and uncertainty. Many child care facilities have lost much of their revenues and are struggling to pay their bills and stay afloat. Providers who already operate on extremely thin margins are spending money on personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to keep children and early childhood educators safe, while facing falling revenues as they serve fewer children to make it easier to physically distance. If they don’t get help soon, a sizable portion of child care providers might have to close their doors permanently and as many as half of all child care slots could disappear. The danger of a radical decline in the child care sector will increase the challenges parents face as they seek to return to work, make it harder for the economy to recover, and force many early childhood educators , who are disproportionately women of color , out of their jobs. President Trump has failed to effectively respond to the caregiving crisis for months, while exacerbating it by letting the virus continue to spread. He should immediately work with Congress to provide emergency relief to save child care centers and family child care providers and support child care workers. This urgent action is critical to investing in the care and education of our youngest children and ensuring that parents and guardians have the support they need to return to work when it is safe to do so. Beyond addressing the pandemic-driven child care crisis, Biden will build our child care infrastructure back better for the long-term, including by making high-quality child care affordable and preschool universal for three- and four-year-olds. His plan will cultivate the potential of young children, provide parents , primarily mothers , with career opportunities and economic security, create an additional 1.5 million new, good, early education jobs, and improve the existing jobs for the essential workers who educate our young children. Biden will:Not only will these investments create jobs for new early educators, Biden’s plan to support our public schools will also create new jobs by tripling Title I funding, fully-funding IDEA, funding community schools, and doubling the number of psychologists, counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. BUILD SAFE CHILD CARE FACILITIES Our nation faced a massive shortage of child care facilities before the pandemic, and the shortage has only intensified since then. One survey found that, even before COVID-19 hit, 43% of parents had difficulty locating child care, and many more struggled to find convenient, affordable care. This shortage stresses parents and guardians, hurts family pocketbooks, and disadvantages children in areas with insufficient child care options. Biden will address this shortage by accelerating the construction and renovation of safe and developmentally appropriate child care facilities in communities and in workplaces, so parents do not have to search in vain for a suitable child care option. Specifically, Biden will create a new child care construction tax credit to encourage businesses to build child care facilities at places of work. Employers will receive 50% of the first $1 million of construction costs per facility, so that employees can enjoy the peace of mind and convenience that comes with on-site child care. At the same time, he’ll make direct investments in building new child-care facilities and upgrading existing facilities around the country that are not accessible for people with disabilities, or safe or developmentally appropriate for young children who are especially vulnerable to environmental contaminants like lead and mold, and to safety hazards like electrical outlets. If his tax credit is fully utilized, and coupled with direct investments, these policies will lead to tens of thousands of new child care facilities across the country. All infrastructure investments will require high standards for the quality of the facilities, including ensuring they are healthy, energy efficient, climate resilient, developmentally appropriate places to learn and accessible for children with disabilities. And, they will require high labor standards for the people who build the facilities, creating thousands of middle-class construction jobs with a choice to join a union. REWARD CAREGIVERS AND EDUCATORS WITH THE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS THEY DESERVE While we rely on our nation’s caregivers and educators to play essential roles in the lives of our loved ones, their current pay and benefits are abysmal. Caregivers and early childhood educators , who are disproportionately women and people of color , are poorly compensated. Direct support professionals and child care workers earn on average less than $12 an hour and $25,000 annually. This low pay contributes to extremely high rates of turnover in the care workforce, which hurts these workers and those for whom they care. Biden will maintain and grow a diverse, talented care and education workforce by providing increased pay and benefits, and access to collective bargaining, training and education, and career ladders. He will ensure these workers receive:	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/the-biden-plan-for-mobilizing-american-talent-and-heart-to-create-a-21st-century-caregiving-and-af5ba2a2dfeb?source=user_profile---------34----------------------------	EmptySummary					Joe Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he's been a single parent.

MEJB217202033	Joe Biden	2020-07-21	My Statement on Coronavirus Relief Negotiations	Morning after morning, Americans are waking to the heart-wrenching news of escalating infection and death totals , and an economic crisis exacerbated by Donald Trump’s catastrophic failure to get the virus under control.How is President Trump responding? He is making a push to block $25 billion for testing and contact tracing from the next package of pandemic relief , critical resources that are supported by congressional Republicans, and which support the most proven and effective tools for battling COVID-19.President Trump’s position defies both logic and humanity. The sole rationale seems to be that, in the words of his own advisors, he “doesn’t want to be distracted by” a tragedy still gripping the United States , even as the rest of the developed world has managed largely to contain the worst of the threat. It is a morally, economically, and scientifically indefensible stance, which Congress should flatly reject.With the President having turned his back on the problem, people are looking to Congress for the support they need to keep their heads above water. As the House and Senate prepare to negotiate the next package of pandemic relief, it is imperative that President Trump and Congress deliver a lifeline to those who need it most: working families and small businesses. Due in large part to the President’s inept response to the crisis, tens of millions of workers still depend on unemployment benefits to make ends meet , and nearly one in ten American small businesses shut down in the week following July 4th alone. The need for substantial, immediate relief is beyond debate , we are plainly a nation in crisis.The next phase of COVID-19 relief must be guided by four commonsense principles:First, all necessary resources to fight the pandemic should be authorized immediately , without delay. If President Trump wants to block them, make him use his veto pen to deny testing, tracing, PPE, and other resources to the American people.Second, not one penny should be spent on cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans. The White House has floated at least three proposals to cut taxes for the super-wealthy and corporations. Congress should reject all of them.Congressional Republicans should focus on ending the outrageous tax loophole for hedge fund investors and real estate developers that was hidden away in the CARES Act , not ending enhanced unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who lost their livelihoods due to the crisis, and who are trying to make ends meet until they are able to get back to work.Third, Congress should mandate that any relief offered to struggling companies must not be used to outsource American jobs. COVID-19 funds, paid for by taxpayers to benefit the nation, should not be spent on displacing American workers. Congress has the power to ensure that loans go only to businesses that will deploy the funds to hire or protect American workers. They should exercise that power without delay.Finally, the next relief package should provide enough resources for our governors and mayors to deal with the crisis locally , including full funding to prevent teacher layoffs and help schools reopen safely this fall. Last week, I called on Congress to pass an emergency education package that would give schools in every district the resources they need to upgrade their buildings, implement sanitation protocols, and otherwise give themselves the best possible shot to get students back into the classroom safely. School reopenings should be a local decision based on local circumstances , but mayors and governors won’t have a chance if we don’t provide safety guidelines and resources on a national scale. This plan must be part of bold state and local fiscal relief that goes beyond schools to fully protect health coverage, help address lost revenues due to the crisis, prevent hundreds of thousands of additional layoffs, and ensure the delivery of critical health and public safety services.I urge Congress to act immediately , and President Trump to sign a relief package , with these three principles in mind. The American people are counting on their leaders to step up, and families and small businesses cannot afford for the relief they desperately need to once again be diminished, delayed, or diverted to the President’s wealthy friends in the midst of this intensifying crisis.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-coronavirus-relief-negotiations-59e343a2f23e?source=user_profile---------35----------------------------	EmptySummary					Morning after morning, Americans are waking to the heart-wrenching news of escalating infection and death totals , and an economic crisis exacerbated by Donald Trump's catastrophic failure to get the virus under control.How is President Trump responding?

The sole rationale seems to be that, in the words of his own advisors, he 'doesn't want to be distracted by' a tragedy still gripping the United States , even as the rest of the developed world has managed largely to contain the worst of the threat. It is a morally, economically, and scientifically indefensible stance, which Congress should flatly reject.With the President having turned his back on the problem, people are looking to Congress for the support they need to keep their heads above water. As the House and Senate prepare to negotiate the next package of pandemic relief, it is imperative that President Trump and Congress deliver a lifeline to those who need it most: working families and small businesses. Due in large part to the President's inept response to the crisis, tens of millions of workers still depend on unemployment benefits to make ends meet , and nearly one in ten American small businesses shut down in the week following July 4th alone. The need for substantial, immediate relief is beyond debate , we are plainly a nation in crisis.The next phase of COVID-19 relief must be guided by four commonsense principles:First, all necessary resources to fight the pandemic should be authorized immediately , without delay. If President Trump wants to block them, make him use his veto pen to deny testing, tracing, PPE, and other resources to the American people.Second, not one penny should be spent on cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans. The White House has floated at least three proposals to cut taxes for the super-wealthy and corporations. Congress should reject all of them.Congressional Republicans should focus on ending the outrageous tax loophole for hedge fund investors and real estate developers that was hidden away in the CARES Act , not ending enhanced unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who lost their livelihoods due to the crisis, and who are trying to make ends meet until they are able to get back to work.Third, Congress should mandate that any relief offered to struggling companies must not be used to outsource American jobs. COVID-19 funds, paid for by taxpayers to benefit the nation, should not be spent on displacing American workers. Congress has the power to ensure that loans go only to businesses that will deploy the funds to hire or protect American workers. They should exercise that power without delay.Finally, the next relief package should provide enough resources for our governors and mayors to deal with the crisis locally , including full funding to prevent teacher layoffs and help schools reopen safely this fall. Last week, I called on Congress to pass an emergency education package that would give schools in every district the resources they need to upgrade their buildings, implement sanitation protocols, and otherwise give themselves the best possible shot to get students back into the classroom safely. School reopenings should be a local decision based on local circumstances , but mayors and governors won't have a chance if we don't provide safety guidelines and resources on a national scale. This plan must be part of bold state and local fiscal relief that goes beyond schools to fully protect health coverage, help address lost revenues due to the crisis, prevent hundreds of thousands of additional layoffs, and ensure the delivery of critical health and public safety services.I urge Congress to act immediately , and President Trump to sign a relief package , with these three principles in mind. The American people are counting on their leaders to step up, and families and small businesses cannot afford for the relief they desperately need to once again be diminished, delayed, or diverted to the President's wealthy friends in the midst of this intensifying crisis.
MEJB237202029	Joe Biden	2020-07-23	My Socially Distanced Conversation With President Obama	I sat down with my friend President Barack Obama to discuss the significant moment we’re in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.Vice President Biden:Can you imagine standing up when you were president, saying, “It’s not my responsibility”? “I take no responsibility”? I mean, literally.President Obama:Those words didn’t come out of our mouths, while we were in office.Vice President Biden:I don’t understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through. He just can’t, he can’t relate in any way.President Obama:Well, and one of the things that I have always known about you Joe, it’s the reason why I wanted you to be my vice president and the reason why you were so effective , it all starts with being able to relate. If you can sit down with a family and see your own family in them. The struggles that you’ve gone through, or your parents went through, or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else’s struggles, then you’re going to work hard for them. And that’s always, what’s motivated you to get into public service.President Obama:When we came into office, even before inauguration, we had seen a historic financial crisis, irresponsibility on Wall Street had spread out to Main Street. We had to move fast, not just in a hundred days. We had to move in the first month to get the Recovery Act passed. We’re now in a situation where not only we’ve got an economic crisis, but we also have a public health crisis to boot. Tell me a little bit about how you’re seeing the current economic crisis and how you’re thinking about the economy.Vice President Biden:Well, Mr. President, there’s three pieces that I see. One, we have got to sustain and keep people from going under forever. There’s already 10,000 businesses that are not likely to open again, and a significant number of small businesses and minority businesses. Number two, when they’re able to come back, they not only are able to keep their folks employed on a payroll, but they’re able to cover overhead. They’re able to cover the additional expenses. For example, the idea you can open without social distancing, mask, tests, and all these things that cost a lot of money.President Obama:Those are added costs for small businesses.Vice President Biden:They’re added costs. And they should be able to have that added cost to be able to stay open for the good of the country. But the next stage of this is going to be, if we’re able to if the stimulus is able to keep people afloat, then we have to deal with recovery. And the recovery is building back, but not just building back , as you’ve been talking about and I’ve been talking about , but building back better. We have to change the way in which we deal with allowing people an opportunity to make a living.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:That includes childcare. That includes making significant investments in infrastructure, so people can make a, not only a living wage, but a union wage. Making sure we have build up an entire new public health system, and making sure everybody has health care. And well, now we have a chance we can add a public option now.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:But this guy’s in court, in the middle of a pandemic, trying to take away the protection for a hundred million people who have preexisting conditions. I don’t think he has any sense of empathy or any , I don’t think he can associate at all.President Obama:You and I had experience dealing with health crises , public health crisis , and in each instance, what you and I understood and why I have so much confidence that you’re going to be able to deal with a COVID in the way that other countries, with our kinds of resources that are dealing with it right now, which is smartly. I have confidence that you’re going to actually listen to the experts.Vice President Biden:Yeah.President Obama:And you’re going to pay attention to the science, and you’re not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates.Vice President Biden:When we left office, you had set up a pandemic office within the White House. We had people from the CDC, 44 people in China. We knew pandemic diseases , this wasn’t going to be the only one that ever occurred.President Obama:Correct. And the goal was to create an early warning system around the world.Vice President Biden:Bingo.President Obama:by creating international cooperation so that when you saw it coming, you had time to prepare.Vice President Biden:Right.President Obama:I know how deeply you care about American families and that any loss of life that is preventable, if you’re president of the United States, it’s your job to try to prevent it. And one of the things that I think you said that’s so important, and you understood, we understood this during the financial crisis, you can’t separate out the public health crisis from the economy. If you want the economy growing again, people have to feel safe.Vice President Biden:What you did, and what all great presidents do, is they not only lead, they persuade. I think what you did with Obamacare , the ACA , and what you wanted to do, is to have a public option. It’s the quickest, fastest way to get everyone covered. I remember when Beau was toward the end and the only person I told the detail all the time was you, because you had a right to know exactly what my and he only had months left to go. And I used to sit there and watch him in the bed and in pain, and dying and glioblastoma. And I thought to myself, what would happen if his insurance company was able to come in, which they could have done before we passed Obamacare, and said, “You have out run your insurance. You’ve outlived it. Suffer the last five months of your life in peace. You’re on your own.” All the things that it did, that it was so profound an impact on people, it was like it took them awhile until they started to take it away, to realize what was happening.President Obama:Look, I mean, you and I both know what it’s like to have somebody you love get really sick. And in some cases to lose somebody, but that loss is compounded when you see the stress on their faces, because they’re worried that they’re being a burden on their families. They’re worried about whether the insurance is gonna cover the treatments that they need. I couldn’t be prouder of what we got done. 20 million people have health insurance that didn’t have it because of what we did. But you remember when we were talking about this, I always used to say the Affordable Care Act , Obamacare , it’s like a starter house. It’s the first house you get. And it’s not the end of the process, it’s the beginning of the process.Vice President Biden:You know, we used to say that, you know, this is a starter house. Remember I used to say? It’s like social security when it was first passed.President Obama:That’s exactly right.Vice President Biden:Social security was first passed was this narrow.President Obama:Very narrow.Vice President Biden:Social security now.President Obama:And you kept on building.Vice President Biden:It kept building it out.President Obama:Making it a better.Vice President Biden:Well, it’s a little that starter house, they got inside the house and they realized, “Wow, God, this is better than being out in the cold.” That’s number one. But number two. And then they said, “But I got a guy out there banging down the house, trying to take down a house. And I didn’t realize the reason I had this house.” And what’s happening now is that you have so many people now, I can’t think of any time since the flu in 1918.President Obama:1918, yeah.Vice President Biden:That the public had , I don’t know then, but it appears , had to be totally, thoroughly aware of how vulnerable they were.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:Now you have people going, “Oh my Lord.”President Obama:And look, you’re absolutely right. That it is hard to fathom anybody wanting to take away people’s health care in the middle of a major public health crisis.Vice President Biden:And offer nothing.President Obama:At a time when unemployment is in double digits. There, there’s another issue that’s been on our minds and was on our minds during my presidency. And that is the issue of race in America. And how communities of color are policed, how you know, police are interacting and, and oftentimes acting in ways that are racially biased. And after the George Floyd tragedy, what we have seen is this extraordinary mobilization across the country of people of every walk of life, every race, every creed, who say, “We’re past time to do something about this. We understand we’re not going to fix it all in one day, but we’re going to take this seriously, and we’re going to start now.” And we had experiences with this during my administration. Our response was not to ignore those problems. Our response was we had a 21st century policing task force that we put together that drew police chiefs, academics, young members of Black Lives Matter all in a single conversation. And we arrived at a series of recommendations that are still pertinent to this day.Vice President Biden:We got through the notion that if a police department was engaging in a practice and a pattern that was in violation of basic civil rights and civil liberties, the Justice Department of the United States of America , the federal government , would intervene and stop it.President Obama:Right.Vice President Biden:Well, you authorized to put in place a whole range of things that would increase what most cops , the guys I grew up with became cops, firefighters, and, you know, or priests. I mean, I wasn’t qualified to do any one of them. The point was that they know they need more guidance.President Obama:And I think this is a process that we’re all going through and we’re all learning. And something that I’ve always admired about you, Joe, is your willingness to listen and learn. It is a sign of leadership when you are willing to hear other people’s experiences. It has to do with communities that have systematically been under-invested in. It has to do with hiring. And the fact that, you know, if you get on the phone applying for a job, send in your résumé, if your name is John, you might get called back. If your name’s Jamal, you might not.Vice President Biden:It’s about to be able to be able to accumulate wealth. It’s about being able to be in a position , you know better than I do, but I’ve watched it my whole life working in the city , Black entrepreneurs are as successful as white entrepreneurs, given a shot in the same circumstance.President Obama:We’re in a moment right now , my daughters, your granddaughters have been involved in this moment.Vice President Biden:Best friends.President Obama:in which this next generation is saying, “We have beliefs in all people being equal. And we don’t see that operating out there. We’re going to do something about it.”Vice President Biden:Yep.President Obama:And I think the key right now, and this is why I have so much confidence in your administration, wanting to be a partner in harnessing that energy and bringing about concrete reforms, concrete steps, not just in the criminal justice system, not just with respect to policing, but also with respect to investment, jobs, business development, is going to send a signal of decency and regard and concern and community around the country , because policy is important, laws are important, budgets are important. But you know, what’s important also is, is what kind of values are you communicating?Vice President Biden:Bingo.President Obama:And if we want to create a world that we want our kids and grandkids to grow up in, then we’re going to have to do a whole lot better than we’re doing.Vice President Biden:We got a hell of an opportunity.President Obama:And everybody’s going to have to be involved.Vice President Biden:We’ve got a hell of an opportunity, right? Because look what’s happened, you’ve got 70% of the American people saying we got to do something about this, right. I’m not just talking about police.President Obama:Yeah. And that’s a big change from when you and I were in office.Vice President Biden:Exactly. No, it’s a gigantic size. And let me tell you my thesis of why there’s two ways in which presidents motivate people , by doing something really ennobling, important, and people go, “Oh!”, or to do something really bad. This guy has generated a sense out there, that people are waking up to, that he ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator. And I think people are now going, “I don’t want my kid growing up that way”.President Obama:You know what it’s like, as much as anybody, to be in the White House during a crisis. You know what it’s like to have to get laws passed through Congress. You know what it’s like to deal with foreign leaders, you know what it’s like and how lonely it can be to make tough decisions , where not every decision is going to be perfect, but you gotta make them and take responsibility for it. I’ve seen you with families that have gone through tragedies, and the thing I’ve got confidence in Joe, is your heart and your character. And the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.President Obama:And for all the specific policies that we’re going to need, more than anything, it’s just that basic decency and an understanding about what’s best in America. That I think people are going to be hungry for. Looking forward to working with you, to do whatever I can to help. And I have confidence in your commitment to making sure that we seize this moment that we have right now.Vice President Biden:Thank you, and I have faith in the American people.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-socially-distanced-conversation-with-president-obama-78511280714a?source=user_profile---------31----------------------------	EmptySummary					I sat down with my friend President Barack Obama to discuss the significant moment we're in, who we are as a nation, and how we can build back better.Vice President Biden:Can you imagine standing up when you were president, saying, 'It's not my responsibility'?

MEJB267202028	Joe Biden	2020-07-26	My Statement on the 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act	Thirty years ago today, our nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise by passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. For the estimated 61 million Americans now living with a disability, the ADA has been a critical source of opportunity, participation, self-sufficiency, and respect , a triumph of American civil rights.I will never forget the leadership and persistence of my friends, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Major Owens, and Congressman Tony Coelho, who teamed up to create the ADA against long odds and determined opposition. Nor will I forget the moment just after it passed, when Senator Harkin delivered a speech from the Senate floor in American Sign Language as a tribute to his older brother, Frank, who was deaf. For tens of millions of American families, this work could not be more personal.I was immensely proud to cosponsor the ADA, which was forged through fearless advocacy and tough bipartisan negotiations , a Democratic bill signed by George H.W. Bush, a Republican President. It rose above the foundation laid by other landmark laws I had the honor of helping to pass, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. And its legacy was furthered by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which finally barred health insurers from instituting lifetime caps on benefits , and denying coverage altogether , for Americans living with disabilities.Today, President Trump threatens that progress, consistently disparaging Americans with disabilities with his rhetoric and actions. His administration has attempted to undermine the ADA by making it harder for Americans with disabilities to exercise their civil rights by filing claims. And he has repeatedly tried to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act , two of the most important safeguards of the health and independence of Americans with disabilities.If I have the honor of becoming President, every policy I pursue , from rebuilding our middle class, to fighting climate change, to achieving universal health coverage , will be created with the full inclusion and dignity of Americans with disabilities in mind. As we seek to recover from a devastating public health crisis that is disproportionately impacting people with disabilities, it is more important than ever that we fulfill the promise of the ADA and build a more equal and inclusive society. My comprehensive Plan for Full Participation and Equality for People with Disabilities seeks to do just that through a broad sweep of laws, policies, and actions designed to uplift dignity and opportunity.The plan creates a senior White House position dedicated to asserting the interests of Americans with disabilities in every area of policy development , ensuring that disability rights are embedded in everything we pursue. We will make bold investments in home and community care through Medicaid to help states clear the backlog of 800,000 people who need support, but can’t get it. We will give a major, long-overdue raise to the direct care workforce. And we will guarantee access to high quality, affordable health care , including mental health care , for every American.My plan also eliminates employment barriers for workers with disabilities , phasing out the subminimum wage and creating new job opportunities for Americans with disabilities. We will fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, invest in accessible child care, and provide federal support to ease students with disabilities’ transitions from high school to higher education and employment opportunities. And we will invest in accessible, affordable, and integrated housing and transportation; eliminate the Supplemental Security Income marriage penalty and other provisions that prevent Americans with disabilities from achieving economic security; and use every tool of American diplomacy to advance disability rights on a global scale.Finally , and most urgently , we will take immediate steps to support Americans with disabilities grappling with the coronavirus pandemic: outlawing the rationing of scarce medical resources based on a patient’s disability; aggressively enforcing non-discrimination laws; making sure that people living in the community have access to PPE when it is most critically needed; expanding remote mental health and food and medicine delivery programs; launching an emergency paid leave program; and investing in accessible technology to meet the needs of students with disabilities.Thirty years on, we still have work to do to realize the full aspiration of the ADA. We need to ensure that every American has the chance to live independently, contribute their talents to our society, and go through life free from the burden of discriminatory systems and practices. I look forward to working together with the disability community to bring us closer to those goals , and finally deliver on the promise of the ADA.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-7cb340cfe223?source=user_profile---------30----------------------------	EmptySummary					Thirty years ago today, our nation moved closer to the fulfillment of its foundational promise by passing the Americans with Disabilities Act. For the estimated 61 million Americans now living with a disability, the ADA has been a critical source of opportunity, participation, self-sufficiency, and respect , a triumph of American civil rights.I will never forget the leadership and persistence of my friends, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Ted Kennedy, Congressman Major Owens, and Congressman Tony Coelho, who teamed up to create the ADA against long odds and determined opposition. Nor will I forget the moment just after it passed, when Senator Harkin delivered a speech from the Senate floor in American Sign Language as a tribute to his older brother, Frank, who was deaf. For tens of millions of American families, this work could not be more personal.I was immensely proud to cosponsor the ADA, which was forged through fearless advocacy and tough bipartisan negotiations , a Democratic bill signed by George H.W. Bush, a Republican President. It rose above the foundation laid by other landmark laws I had the honor of helping to pass, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. And its legacy was furthered by the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which finally barred health insurers from instituting lifetime caps on benefits , and denying coverage altogether , for Americans living with disabilities.Today, President Trump threatens that progress, consistently disparaging Americans with disabilities with his rhetoric and actions. His administration has attempted to undermine the ADA by making it harder for Americans with disabilities to exercise their civil rights by filing claims. And he has repeatedly tried to gut Medicaid and repeal the Affordable Care Act , two of the most important safeguards of the health and independence of Americans with disabilities.If I have the honor of becoming President, every policy I pursue , from rebuilding our middle class, to fighting climate change, to achieving universal health coverage , will be created with the full inclusion and dignity of Americans with disabilities in mind. As we seek to recover from a devastating public health crisis that is disproportionately impacting people with disabilities, it is more important than ever that we fulfill the promise of the ADA and build a more equal and inclusive society.

MEJB277202026	Joe Biden	2020-07-27	My Statement on Vaccines	It’s great news that scientists are making progress in the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. We all hope the next phases of clinical trials will yield positive results to support an approval based on the scientific evidence, but the development of a new vaccine requires a dedication to science, coordination, transparency, truth, and fairness to all , and we have a President who stands for none of these things.The American people’s health depends on confidence in the safety of any vaccine. As we enter the height of election season, President Trump should assure us all that the White House will respect the independent authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide, free from political pressure, if the vaccine is safe and effective.Today, I am calling on President Trump to commit to the three principles of integrity in the development of a vaccine. These are the same principles I will follow as President:First, scientists and public health experts decide on safety and efficacy. The White House should not weigh in on these matters or push the FDA to provide emergency authorizations prematurely, as they did for hydroxychloroquine. The President should not “hype” treatments or vaccines, overstate their results, or undermine confidence in scientific findings.Second, clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves should be made available to the public for independent expert review. The FDA should convene the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee for public session prior to any final FDA decision.Third, there must be full transparency on recommendations by career staff. The career staff in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research should be authorized to write a written report for public review. If the FDA Commissioner decides to reverse the career staff’s findings, he must explain the basis of the decision in a public report. Before a license is final, senior career scientists and public health experts should be allowed to make public, uncensored statements and appear before Congress unconstrained to speak the truth.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-vaccines-2133deed94ee?source=user_profile---------28----------------------------	EmptySummary					It's great news that scientists are making progress in the search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.

MEJB277202027	Joe Biden	2020-07-27	The Biden Agenda for Women	Joe Biden is going to build our country back better after this economic crisis and that includes ensuring we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women. Women , particularly women of color , have never had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. Today, too many women are struggling to make ends meet and support their families, and are worried about the economic future for their children. This was true before the COVID-19 crisis, but the current global health crisis has exacerbated these realities for women.For Biden, it’s a simple proposition: his daughter is entitled to the same rights and opportunities as his sons. He believes every issue is a women’s issue , health care, the economy, education, national security , but women are also uniquely and disproportionately impacted by many policies. As President, Biden will pursue an aggressive and comprehensive plan to further women’s economic and physical security and ensure that women can fully exercise their civil rights. Biden will:Biden will start on day one of his Administration leading by example, making sure his political appointees, including his Cabinet, and our entire federal workforce look like the country they serve. Biden has committed to selecting a woman to be his Vice President and an African American woman to be his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, but his commitment to ensuring women help lead his Administration does not end there. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve. He will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce, which President Trump has ignored. He will modify it to mandate that Cabinet agencies and other executive branch agencies work with federal employee unions to create and implement a diversity and inclusion plan for the federal workforce. And, he will provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted.Biden will also structure his Administration to ensure women’s issues remain at the forefront of policy efforts. Biden knows that addressing the challenges faced by women and girls is more than just a campaign promise , it’s an imperative if the Administration is going to succeed in its broader efforts to make sure the government and economy work for all Americans. Biden will ensure that his administration aggressively protects the rights and addresses the unique needs of all women, including Black women, Latina women, Native women, Asian American and Pacific Islander women, women with disabilities, and lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer women. The Obama-Biden Administration created the White House Council on Women and Girls to make sure the federal government was doing its best to tackle issues like equal pay, paid family leave, and poverty in an effective manner. The Trump Administration then disbanded it and put nothing in its place. Biden will create a White House Council on Gender Equality, chaired by a senior member of the Executive Office of the President tasked solely with guiding and coordinating government policy that impacts women and girls, such as economic policy, health care, racial justice, gender-based violence, and foreign policy.As President, Biden will work with advocates across the country to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) so women’s rights are once and for all explicitly enshrined in our Constitution. Biden co-sponsored the ERA nine times. As President, he will work with advocates across the country to enshrine gender equality in our Constitution. Now that Virginia has become the 38th state to ratify the ERA, Biden will proudly advocate for Congress to recognize that 3/4th of states have ratified the amendment and take action so our Constitution makes clear that any government-related discrimination against women is unconstitutional.IMPROVE ECONOMIC SECURIT,Women hold only 32% of the wealth men have accumulated and women of color only hold pennies on every dollar a white man holds. Women in the workforce, on average, earn less than men do. When they start a business, they have less access to capital, and have to dip into their personal finances. Only 56% of women ages 18–34 are able to save, compared to 70% of men. And women , primarily Black women , hold two-thirds of the nation’s student debt, both exacerbating and resulting from racial and gender wealth gaps. This is especially detrimental for the over 4 in 10 mothers , especially women of color , who are sole or primary breadwinners for their families.Biden will tackle this wealth gap, including by fighting for equal pay, ending other forms of workplace discrimination and harassment, encouraging and supporting women entrepreneurs and small business owners, making education and training more affordable, providing pathways into high-paying professions, expanding access to paid leave and child care, and strengthening union organizing and collective bargaining.Fighting for Equal Pa,For every dollar a man makes, the average woman makes 82 cents , with Black women earning 62 cents, Native women earning 57 cents, and Latinas earning 54 cents. For a woman who works full time, year round, that’s a gap of more than $10,000 annually. This gap adds up, on average, to over $400,000 throughout a forty-year career and roughly $1 million for women of color. The gender wage gap starts when young women first start working and continues for older women even into retirement, no matter the woman’s education level or occupation. It can exacerbate other biases, with a magnified impact for women of color, transgender women, women with disabilities, and immigrant women.The Lilly Ledbetter Act Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation the Obama-Biden Administration enacted, and Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He strongly supports Senator Patty Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro’s Paycheck Fairness Act, which codifies and expands critical Obama-Biden protections for workers’ paychecks. He will build on it as President and protect workers against retaliation for discussing wages. Today, one in four private-sector workers are in a workplace where they can’t talk about their current wage rate with other employees without fear of retribution from their employers. Many states and the District of Columbia outlaw employers from retaliating against workers who talk about pay. Under a Biden presidency, it will be national. Biden will also:Ending Other Forms of Workplace Discrimination and Harassmen,Investing in Women-Owned Small Businesse,Women start businesses at two times the rate of men and now represent 42% of the nation’s businesses. But, they still raise much less capital , with only about 2% of all venture capital funds going to women-owned businesses , and are more likely to rely on personal funds. Biden will ensure women-owned small businesses have the capital, technical assistance, mentorship, and support they need to ensure they are able to grow. For example, Biden will:Expand Access to Education and Trainin,Biden will ensure that women receive educational opportunities to unleash their full potential to grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class. He will aggressively enforce Title IX protections to ensure that women and girls receive full access to these opportunities, from admissions to financial aid to sports. In addition, he will:Expand Pay and Benefits for Jobs Disproportionately Filled by Wome,Biden will focus on improving women’s economic security by expanding the pay and benefits for underpaid jobs that are disproportionately filled by women, starting by:EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND TACKLE HEALTH DISPARITIE,The Affordable Care Act was , and still is , a big deal, especially for women. Because of Obamacare, millions of women gained the peace of mind that comes with insurance. And, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or even pregnancy. Insurance companies can no longer charge someone more because they are a woman , a practice which costs women $1 billion more than men annually. Young adults can get coverage through their parents’ insurance plans until age 26. Insurance plans have to cover essential benefits like maternity care. And, insurance plans now have to cover critical recommended preventive services free of charge.But now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act.As President, Biden will protect and build on Obamacare , to expand access, lower costs, and make quality, affordable health care a right for all. Read Biden’s full plan for building on Obamacare with a new public option at joebiden.com/healthcare.Maternal Mortalit,Before the pandemic, the U.S. already had one of the highest rates of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth relative to other developed countries, especially among Black women, who were 2.5 times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, and Native women, who from 2011 to 2016 were 2.3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than were white women. California came up with a strategy that halved the state’s maternal death rate. As President, Biden will reduce our unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, starting by taking the California strategy nationwide.Maternal mortality is just one example of the types of health disparities that Biden will direct his Secretary of Health and Human Services to address.Reproductive Healt,The Affordable Care Act made historic progress ensuring access to free preventive care, including contraception. The Biden Plan will build on that progress. Vice President Biden supports repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one’s zip code or income. And, the public option will cover contraception and a woman’s constitutional right under Roe v. Wade. Biden will also:Health Care Protections for Al,HELP WOMEN NAVIGATE WORK AND FAMIL,Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he’s been a single parent. He knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for women in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members.In the United States, women overwhelmingly take on the responsibilities of caring for their families, and thus are disproportionately impacted by the gaps in our caregiving system. Only one in six American workers typically has access to paid family leave if they need it. Black and Latino individuals are even less likely to be able to take paid leave. And, when parents are forced to choose between their jobs and caregiving responsibilities, the costs are great , both to them and to the economy. Women who need to work part-time on average earn lower hourly wages and benefits. And, the lack of family friendly policies is causing many women to leave the workforce completely.These decisions have real costs for families. A recent study found that a woman in her twenties who left the workforce for five years to care for her young children earns nearly 20% less over her lifetime. A similar study estimated that the absence of paid family and medical leave costs workers and their families roughly $22.5 billion a year in wages. Consequences can be especially severe for women of color who are more likely to be both breadwinners and caregivers, all while earning lower-pay to cushion the loss of work.Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. He will make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he will ensure all workers have access to up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, can earn 7 days of paid sick leave, and have fair and flexible schedules so they can more easily manage their families and careers.Biden will:Read Joe Biden’s full plan for Mobilizing American Talent and Heart to Create a 21st Century Caregiving and Education Workforce at joebiden.com/caregiving.Biden will also ensure women and all workers have comprehensive paid leave and fair and flexible schedules.END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOME,One of the driving forces throughout Biden’s career has been fighting back against abuses of power , whether economic or physical power. That force motivated him to write and champion the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He wrote and spearheaded the groundbreaking VAWA in 1990 at a time when few in Washington cared about domestic violence and sexual assault. He lifted survivors’ voices, won over the skeptics, and pushed until the bill became law in 1994. The Act created a national hotline for victims. It funded shelters and crisis centers. It trained law enforcement in communities across the country so they were better prepared to investigate violence against women and support survivors of violence. And, it helped change the way Americans understand and fundamentally view violence against women.Since then, Biden has continued this work by leading efforts to ensure Congress passed legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) three times: in 2000, 2005, and 2013. Each time, the VAWA reauthorization has upped the ante and ensured that especially vulnerable communities , from Native women to LGBTQ+ individuals , are included in the Act. Also while in the Senate, Biden introduced and helped pass the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act in 2008. As Vice President, he established the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and started a national effort to change the culture on campus sexual assault. After leaving the White House, Biden continued his work to change the culture of violence and end campus sexual assault through the Biden Foundation.As President, Biden will build on his strong track record of getting things done for survivors of gender-based violence by pursuing a bold plan to save more lives and make communities safer for all. He will:Read Biden’s full plans to end violence against women at joebiden.com/vawa and his plan to address violence against women during COVID-19 at joebiden.com/plans-to-support-women-duringcovid19/.PROTECT AND EMPOWER WOMEN GLOBALL,Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women. Yet, women are underrepresented in positions of power in most countries around the world. Trillions of dollars are lost each year from the global economy because women are excluded from full economic participation. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. Globally, 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; one in five girls are likely to marry before she turns 18. These statistics are bad for women, they’re bad for countries and economies, and they are likely to worsen post-pandemic.That’s why the Obama-Biden Administration put a direct focus on women’s and girls’ empowerment to enhance our national security. The Administration created the first U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; the first U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally; as well as the first U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls. As a Senator, Biden introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a framework for the United States to address gender-based violence globally. The Obama-Biden administration implemented many of IVAWA’s provisions via executive action and adopted its comprehensive approach to gender-based violence.Yet, instead of building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. The effects of Trump’s policies are compounded as women and girls disproportionately bear the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly those in already-marginalized communities or living in fragile states or as migrants, displaced persons, and refugees.Biden believes that we must support women through the current health and economic crises, draw on their expertise to ensure an effective recovery, and address the factors that leave them vulnerable in the first place. Biden will restore America’s leading role as a champion for women and girls around the world and return to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and abroad. He will:	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/the-biden-agenda-for-women-d4055e41822f?source=user_profile---------29----------------------------	EmptySummary					Joe Biden is going to build our country back better after this economic crisis and that includes ensuring we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women.

He knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for women in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members.In the United States, women overwhelmingly take on the responsibilities of caring for their families, and thus are disproportionately impacted by the gaps in our caregiving system. Only one in six American workers typically has access to paid family leave if they need it. Black and Latino individuals are even less likely to be able to take paid leave. And, when parents are forced to choose between their jobs and caregiving responsibilities, the costs are great , both to them and to the economy. Women who need to work part-time on average earn lower hourly wages and benefits. And, the lack of family friendly policies is causing many women to leave the workforce completely.These decisions have real costs for families. A recent study found that a woman in her twenties who left the workforce for five years to care for her young children earns nearly 20% less over her lifetime. A similar study estimated that the absence of paid family and medical leave costs workers and their families roughly $22.5 billion a year in wages. Consequences can be especially severe for women of color who are more likely to be both breadwinners and caregivers, all while earning lower-pay to cushion the loss of work.Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. He will make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he will ensure all workers have access to up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, can earn 7 days of paid sick leave, and have fair and flexible schedules so they can more easily manage their families and careers.Biden will:Read Joe Biden's full plan for Mobilizing American Talent and Heart to Create a 21st Century Caregiving and Education Workforce at will also ensure women and all workers have comprehensive paid leave and fair and flexible schedules.END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOME,One of the driving forces throughout Biden's career has been fighting back against abuses of power , whether economic or physical power. That force motivated him to write and champion the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He wrote and spearheaded the groundbreaking VAWA in 1990 at a time when few in Washington cared about domestic violence and sexual assault. He lifted survivors' voices, won over the skeptics, and pushed until the bill became law in 1994. The Act created a national hotline for victims. It funded shelters and crisis centers. It trained law enforcement in communities across the country so they were better prepared to investigate violence against women and support survivors of violence. And, it helped change the way Americans understand and fundamentally view violence against women.Since then, Biden has continued this work by leading efforts to ensure Congress passed legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) three times: in 2000, 2005, and 2013. Each time, the VAWA reauthorization has upped the ante and ensured that especially vulnerable communities , from Native women to LGBTQ+ individuals , are included in the Act. Also while in the Senate, Biden introduced and helped pass the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act in 2008. As Vice President, he established the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and started a national effort to change the culture on campus sexual assault. After leaving the White House, Biden continued his work to change the culture of violence and end campus sexual assault through the Biden Foundation.As President, Biden will build on his strong track record of getting things done for survivors of gender-based violence by pursuing a bold plan to save more lives and make communities safer for all. Read Biden's full plans to end violence against women at and his plan to address violence against women during COVID-19 at AND EMPOWER WOMEN GLOBALL,Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women. Yet, women are underrepresented in positions of power in most countries around the world. Trillions of dollars are lost each year from the global economy because women are excluded from full economic participation. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. Globally, 130 million girls between the ages of 6 and 17 are not in school; one in five girls are likely to marry before she turns 18. These statistics are bad for women, they're bad for countries and economies, and they are likely to worsen post-pandemic.That's why the Obama-Biden Administration put a direct focus on women's and girls' empowerment to enhance our national security. The Administration created the first U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; the first U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally; as well as the first U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls. As a Senator, Biden introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a framework for the United States to address gender-based violence globally. The Obama-Biden administration implemented many of IVAWA's provisions via executive action and adopted its comprehensive approach to gender-based violence.Yet, instead of building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world's most vulnerable populations. The effects of Trump's policies are compounded as women and girls disproportionately bear the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly those in already-marginalized communities or living in fragile states or as migrants, displaced persons, and refugees.Biden believes that we must support women through the current health and economic crises, draw on their expertise to ensure an effective recovery, and address the factors that leave them vulnerable in the first place. Biden will restore America's leading role as a champion for women and girls around the world and return to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and abroad.
MEJB287202024	Joe Biden	2020-07-28	My Remarks on Racial Economic Equity	Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us.You and your staff do God’s work. This community center gives people hope and a place to belong.I saw that hope as a Senator. And when he was Attorney General of Delaware, my son Beau would attend mass at Sacred Heart and then walk here to listen, notebook in his pocket, and find ways to help.It’s on the East Side, where I was a lifeguard at the local pool as a teenager, where I started my career as a public defender. And this center is named after my friend, William “Hicks” Anderson.Hicks and I went way back.Walk around Wilmington and everyone has a story about him.How he cared. How he was always there for you. How he built a wonderful family, including his twin sons Al and Nnamdi, who give back so much to this communit,They served in the United States Army. They now jointly serve as poet laureates of the State of Delaware.Nnamdi is now a State Representative. Hicks, his family, and everyone at this center, embody the defining story of America.For generations, Americans who are Black, Brown, Native American, immigrant, haven’t always been fully included in our democracy or our economy.But by pure courage, heart and gut, they never give up as they pursue the full promise of America.That’s the story of the people of this community and of this country.That’s why I couldn’t think of a more meaningful place to talk about my Build Back Better economic agenda. A bold, practical plan that will help build a stronger, more just, more sustainable economy where everyone is included in the deal.And it’s the story of two civil rights heroes we lost last week , and who show us the way forward.The Reverend C.T. Vivian, who faced down drownings and beatings to say “You cannot turn your back upon the idea of justice.”And my friend, an American hero, Congressman John Lewis, who crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge one last time on Sunday, and who once said “freedom is not a state, it is an act.”When I spoke to John just before he died, instead of answering my concerns for him, he asked about me, about us.He asked that we stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation.To remain undaunted by the public health crisis and the economic crisis that has taken the blinders off the crisis of systemic racism that still plagues this nation.One thing the Senate and this President can do right away is pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act , just yesterday renamed in memory of John Lewis.Back the effusive praise we’ve heard since he passed, especially from our Republican friends, with action. Protect the sacred right to vote that he was willing to die for.If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as President. We cannot let that fundamental right to vote be denied, especially in the middle of a pandemic that rages on.Nearly 150,000 Americans are now dead from Covid-19, and counting. More than 4 million Americans have tested positive, and counting. Black and Latino people have been three times as likely to be infected , and two times as likely to die from the virus as white people. More than 30 Million people are collecting unemployment checks.Black unemployment is at 15%, Latino unemployment is at 14.5%.Over 40% of black-owned businesses , 440,000 in total , reportedly had to shut down.And everything is worsened by the crisis of presidential leadership.A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president , the duty to care about the entire country, not just himself.He has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic to keep you safe. He can’t turn the economy around to get Americans back to work.And he is , horrifyingly, but not surprisingly , intentionally stoking the flames of division in this country.I’ve said from the outset of the recent protests that there is no place for violence or the destruction of property. Peaceful protesters should be protected , but arsonists and anarchists should be prosecuted , and local law enforcement can do that. When President Obama and I were in office we protected federal property. And we were able to do it without turning DHS into a private militia. That could be done today. But that wouldn’t help Trump’s political interests. He is determined to stoke division and chaos. It’s not good for the country , but Trump doesn’t care. His campaign is failing and he’s looking for a political lifeline. This isn’t about law and order. This is a political strategy to revive a failing campaign. Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to any fire. And it’s the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That’s how we’ll restore peace to the streets.But this election is not just about voting against Donald Trump.It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.Last month, I stopped by Bethel AME Church here in Wilmington. I talked with a group of faith and local leaders. They shared their pain, anger, and frustration at the state of affairs , in our justice system, our politics, our economy. There’s just that sense the deck is stacked.The common theme was how do we break the cycle , in good times, communities of color still lag, in bad times, they get hit first and the hardest and in recovery, take the longest to bounce back.It is about justice.I’ve proposed a criminal justice reform and policing reform agenda and I’m committed to working with the Congress to seeing it through as President.It’s also about jobs. Good-paying jobs, financial stability, and building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids.It’s about economic growth for our country, and outcompeting the world.And it’s also about dignity for working people and the middle class.Over the last few weeks, I’ve laid out my Build Back Better plan based on those necessities and on the idea that we can’t just build back to the way things were before.We have to Build Back Better.We need to make bold, practical investments , to recover from the economic mess we’re in, and to rebuild for the economic future our country deserves. I’ve explained how these investments are paid for.Today, I’m here to explain how Build Back Better will deal with systemic racism and advance racial equity in our economy.So far, Build Back Better has had three parts.First, it’s investing in American manufacturing and technology so the future is Made in America and includes all Americans.Under my plan, we will mobilize the biggest investment in rebuilding our country since World War 2, creating millions of good-paying union jobs.That includes a historic investment in federal procurement, which is the way the government purchases goods and services. Under my proposal, we would make sure those goods and services are American-made in American supply chains , like American steel for our buildings and energy efficient vehicles.But for too long, federal contracting for this work has been inaccessible for too many Black and Brown entrepreneurs and businesses.They too often never get a fair shot to apply.My plan makes sure contractors and subcontractors of color get a fair shot.We will triple the federal goal for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses from 5 percent to a minimum of 15 percent by 2025.And we will create jobs and growth along the way. We can do that.The second plank of Build Back Better advances racial equity by modernizing our infrastructure and taking on climate change with jobs.Take infrastructure, for example.In too many underserved communities of color , the roads are falling apart, street lights are out, sidewalks are cracked, school buildings are outdated. Parks aren’t safe for kids to play and adults to exercise, and there’s nowhere to buy fresh food for miles. Air pollution causes childhood asthma that follows them as adults, and abandoned homes crush property values and diminish the quality of life in neighborhoods. But notwithstanding these systemic barriers, look at the energy, pride, and achievement of communities of color. Imagine if we could truly unleash their full potential. My Build Back Better plan would make sure families in these communities are the ones who benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments. To rebuild those roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband to close the digital divide, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely. Where they can drink clean water, breathe clean air, and shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy food. We can’t rebuild our economy and meet the climate crisis unless we create opportunities for people to rebuild their own communities. This is about jobs. But it’s also about dignity. It’s about pride. We can do this.The third plank of Build Back Better invests in our caregivers , who take care of our aging loved ones and kids.If we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying. And we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators.Families are squeezed emotionally and financially trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.They need help, but often can’t find it or afford it.And the professional caregivers out there , home health workers, child care workers , who are more often women, women of color, and immigrants , are too often underpaid, unseen, and undervalued.But there are things we can do right now to ease the burden.My plan would help clear a waiting list of 800,000 people who are eligible for home and community care through Medicaid and who have signed up for it, but are just waiting.My plan would make sure every 3- and 4-year-old child gets access to free, high-quality preschool like students have at this center. And low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on child care for children under age 5.The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.And my plan would pay and support our caregivers, who are overwhelmingly women and women of color.This plan will help workers, especially those without a college degree, gain new skills in good-paying industries like health care, and provide new pathways to advance their careers. For example, a home health worker can access the training needed to become an EMT, a nurse, a physician’s assistant, or a doctor. We won’t just put millions of Americans to work in new care and early childhood education jobs. We will also free up millions more people to join the paid labor force. Meaning at least 2 million additional jobs and more economic growth for our nation.We can do this.Today, I’m laying out the fourth part of Build Back Better , advancing racial equity across the American economy, not just as part of the other pillars of Build Back Better, but in its own right.To start, we will create a new Small Business Opportunity Fund. It dramatically expands an successful Obama-Biden initiative that generated more than $5 in private investment for every $1 in public investment in small businesses , particularly in hard-pressed areas.We will take $30 Billion from our Made in America investments I announced earlier and put it into this Fund.That will allow us to expand federal support for the most effective state, local, and non-profit programs that provide venture capital and financing for minority business owners and communities in need.It will also allow us to support the community development banks that have a proven record of investing in minority small businesses.That $30 billion will leverage $150 Billion in new financing and equity for more Black and Brown small businesses.So say our Small Business Opportunity Fund supports an investment in a small manufacturer of color seeking to commercialize a new technology.That helps the manufacturer get started. Then private investors notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars too.That helps the manufacturer scale and grow.That’s how we will make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.Here’s why that matters.Right now, we’re in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen.What does Donald Trump do?Give big banks the green light to make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller Black and Brown businesses without those connections.The result?Billions of dollars in the Covid-relief program for small businesses benefited ones who had the lawyers and accountants to help better connected businesses jump the line.Black and Brown small businesses that needed help the most got shut out.In fact, just 12% of Black and Brown businesses surveyed seeking help got the aid they asked for.Now half of them say they’ll have to close up shop. Our economy can’t afford for them to close. Their families can’t afford for them to close. Under my plan, fifty percent of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses with 50 employees or fewer. This would help minority-owned businesses get life-saving loans before more well-connected businesses jump ahead in line. But removing the barriers for Black and Brown entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses is only one of many things we must do to close the racial wealth gap in our nation. Expanding black and brown homeownership is another. Today, there are American cities where about 75% of white Americans own homes, while only about 25% of their fellow Black citizens do. Even in middle class communities of color, the same homes as in white communities are often valued significantly less. Those Black residents then see their wealth accumulate more slowly. When a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth, the homeownership disparity denies equal opportunities. My housing plan from a $15,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit to expanding affordable housing to reversing Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement, will remove the barriers to homeownership that now hold back too many Americans of color on the pathway to the middle class.But we also have to remove another piece of the systemic barrier for too many Black and Brown Americans.What’s holding back too many people of color , in finding a good job or starting a business , is a criminal record that follows them every step of the way.Getting caught for smoking marijuana shouldn’t deny you a good-paying job and career, a loan, or ability to rent an apartment.But right now, that criminal record is the weight that holds back too many people of color.The process to seal or expunge those records can be complicated and costly.And a life of second chances passes by.Now, some safeguards are necessary, but some do more harm than good.And more and more states recognize the significant cost to their economy when people with certain nonviolent criminal records can’t fully contribute their full talents and capacity.But even when those states want to give that person a second chance and seal or expunge certain nonviolent criminal records, their record keeping systems are outdated.It is paper spread across different courthouses.Under my plan, if a state decides it wants to implement an automated system for sealing or expunging certain nonviolent criminal records, the federal government will help them do that.That’s what racial equity in our economy looks like.And here’s another step we will take under my Build Back Better plan to fully include more people into the deal , strengthen the Federal Reserve’s focus on racial economic equity.The Fed has a profound impact on our economy.Its existing mandate promotes maximum employment and stable prices.Under my plan, I believe the Fed should add to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, wealth, and revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including diverse nominees for the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. So when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve provides a report on the health of the economy , we’ll know if the economy is working for everyone.That’s when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone.To include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things if given just half a chance.People like Markevis Gideon, who I just met backstage. His Mom and Dad never went to college. He was 12 when he got an old laptop handed to him. He took it apart and put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT systems specialist. He went to college. Studied abroad. Came back home to see the digital divide in his community. So he started a business getting computers to folks. He’s 22 now. Married with a little baby. He also has 7 employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good-paying IT jobs. It’s incredible. And he is incredible. Some of the people he’s helped only had an 8th grade education. Never used a computer before. Five weeks later, they know how. Some are now earning $15/hr for the first time. They are incredible. Markevis wants to scale his business and continue reinvesting in the people of this community. That’s pure courage, heart, and gut.He never gives up in pursuit of the full promise of America.That’s who we are. That’s what this election is about. We are America.We don’t settle. We aspire. We succeed.Thank you.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-remarks-on-racial-economic-equity-5767ac198451?source=user_profile---------26----------------------------	EmptySummary					Thank you, Wayne Jefferson, and everyone at the Hicks center for hosting us.You and your staff do God's work.

Then private investors notice the promise of that business and invest their private dollars too.That helps the manufacturer scale and grow.That's how we will make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.Here's why that matters.Right now, we're in the midst of one of the greatest threats to small businesses our country has ever seen.What does Donald Trump do?Give big banks the green light to make millions of dollars in fees by favoring their most well-off and well-connected clients while shutting the door on smaller Black and Brown businesses without those connections.The result?Billions of dollars in the Covid-relief program for small businesses benefited ones who had the lawyers and accountants to help better connected businesses jump the line.Black and Brown small businesses that needed help the most got shut out.In fact, just 12% of Black and Brown businesses surveyed seeking help got the aid they asked for.Now half of them say they'll have to close up shop. Our economy can't afford for them to close. Their families can't afford for them to close. Under my plan, fifty percent of emergency small business relief would be reserved for the smallest businesses with 50 employees or fewer. This would help minority-owned businesses get life-saving loans before more well-connected businesses jump ahead in line. But removing the barriers for Black and Brown entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses is only one of many things we must do to close the racial wealth gap in our nation. Expanding black and brown homeownership is another. Today, there are American cities where about 75% of white Americans own homes, while only about 25% of their fellow Black citizens do. Even in middle class communities of color, the same homes as in white communities are often valued significantly less. Those Black residents then see their wealth accumulate more slowly. When a house is an asset that helps build equity and wealth, the homeownership disparity denies equal opportunities. My housing plan from a $15,000 first-time home-buyer tax credit to expanding affordable housing to reversing Trump's efforts to gut fair housing enforcement, will remove the barriers to homeownership that now hold back too many Americans of color on the pathway to the middle class.But we also have to remove another piece of the systemic barrier for too many Black and Brown Americans.What's holding back too many people of color , in finding a good job or starting a business , is a criminal record that follows them every step of the way.Getting caught for smoking marijuana shouldn't deny you a good-paying job and career, a loan, or ability to rent an apartment.But right now, that criminal record is the weight that holds back too many people of color.The process to seal or expunge those records can be complicated and costly.And a life of second chances passes by.Now, some safeguards are necessary, but some do more harm than good.And more and more states recognize the significant cost to their economy when people with certain nonviolent criminal records can't fully contribute their full talents and capacity.But even when those states want to give that person a second chance and seal or expunge certain nonviolent criminal records, their record keeping systems are outdated.It is paper spread across different courthouses.Under my plan, if a state decides it wants to implement an automated system for sealing or expunging certain nonviolent criminal records, the federal government will help them do that.That's what racial equity in our economy looks like.And here's another step we will take under my Build Back Better plan to fully include more people into the deal , strengthen the Federal Reserve's focus on racial economic equity.The Fed has a profound impact on our economy.Its existing mandate promotes maximum employment and stable prices.Under my plan, I believe the Fed should add to that responsibility and aggressively target persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, wealth, and revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including diverse nominees for the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. So when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve provides a report on the health of the economy , we'll know if the economy is working for everyone.That's when racial equity is not just an aspiration, but a theory of change and how we build our economic future to include everyone.To include all those remarkable people out there doing extraordinary things if given just half a chance.People like Markevis Gideon, who I just met backstage. His Mom and Dad never went to college. He was 12 when he got an old laptop handed to him. He took it apart and put it back together. It changed his life. At 17, he got certified to become an IT systems specialist. He went to college. Studied abroad. Came back home to see the digital divide in his community. So he started a business getting computers to folks. He's 22 now. Married with a little baby. He also has 7 employees. His goal is to teach people how to repair and recycle computers and create a workforce development program to get them trained for good-paying IT jobs. It's incredible. And he is incredible. Some of the people he's helped only had an 8th grade education. Never used a computer before. Five weeks later, they know how. Some are now earning $15/hr for the first time. They are incredible. Markevis wants to scale his business and continue reinvesting in the people of this community. That's pure courage, heart, and gut.He never gives up in pursuit of the full promise of America.That's who we are. That's what this election is about. We are America.We don't settle. We aspire. We succeed.Thank you.
MEJB287202025	Joe Biden	2020-07-28	The Biden Plan to Build Back Better by Advancing Racial Equity Across the American Economy	Joe Biden’s jobs and economic recovery agenda is built on the proposition that we must build our economy back better than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Over the last month, Biden has been laying out his vision for a stronger, resilient, and inclusive economy. He believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be included in the deal. An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and Native American workers and families are finally welcomed as full participants. Today, multiple, overlapping crises reinforce how far we have to go to deliver on that vision. The pandemic has shone a bright light on racial disparities in health and health care , as Black and Brown Americans have suffered and died from the coronavirus at rates far higher than white Americans. The economic crisis has hit Black and Brown communities especially hard, with Black unemployment at 15.4 percent, Latino unemployment at 14.5 percent, and businesses owned by Black, Latino, and Asian American people closing down at alarming rates. We are also seeing a national reckoning on racial justice and the tragic human costs of systemic racism in the murder of George Floyd and so many other Black men, women, and children. And through it all, the climate crisis mounts, with air and water pollution, superstorms and extreme weather, disproportionately impacting Black and Brown communities. Biden believes we cannot build back better without a major mobilization of effort and resources to address these challenges and to advance racial equity across the American economy. That is why racial equity is a distinct pillar of his Build Back Better plan, as well as incorporated in each of the other pillars. Biden will remove barriers to participation in our economy, expand access to opportunity, and fully enforce the policies and laws that we already have on the books , and the pledges Biden has made in this campaign. In laying out his Build Back Better agenda, Biden has announced bold investments , in infrastructure, innovation, manufacturing, education, housing, clean energy, federal procurement, and small businesses. Today, as the fourth pillar of the Build Back Better Agenda, he is announcing how he will direct many of these investments to advance racial equity as part of our nation’s economic recovery. Specifically, Biden will:SPUR PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT THROUGH A NEW SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY PLAN Small business ownership is one of our country’s cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Black and Brown people, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , and particularly for Black-, Latino-, AAPI-, and Native American-owned businesses. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious “restart package” to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is launching a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Collectively, Biden will leverage more than $150 billion in new capital and opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally excluded for generations. Biden will devote $30 billion (or 10%) of the $300 billion in innovation funding as part of his plan to ensure the future is “Made in All of America” to the Small Business Opportunity Fund to leverage private investment of $5 for each $1 of new public investment to reach this $150 billion. And, by empowering the financial institutions that support businesses owned by Black and Brown people, generating new capital, and providing robust technical assistance, Biden will unleash the full potential of small businesses and entrepreneurs. Spur More than $50 Billion in New Equity Investment and Venture Capital for Entrepreneurs in Economically Disadvantaged Areas: Black and Brown entrepreneurs face unique barriers to obtaining the capital that they need to start and grow a business. For example, three-fourths of venture capital goes to just four cities , and far too little flows to businesses owned by Black and Brown people. To address this problem, Biden will:Leverage $100 Billion in Additional Financing for Small Businesses: In 2019, only 10% of funding from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) major lending programs went to Black, Latino, and Native American entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, the Paycheck Protection Program has been rife with inequities: A recent “secret shopper” study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that when Black small businesses applicants contacted a bank, nearly half the time, they were given inferior treatment to white applicants with nearly identical credit histories and business profiles. To address this problem, Biden will:Expanding Access to Additional Resources and Technical Assistance for Black and Brown Entrepreneurs: There are no limits or barriers to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit across our nation. Yet, for many, there are major limits to accessing the networks and professional services needed to succeed. For small businesses in underserved communities, this type of assistance is often unavailable or unaffordable, creating an additional barrier to opportunity. As President, Biden will launch an Expanding Entrepreneurship Initiative that provides all Americans, regardless of their background, with the resources and technical assistance they need to start and grow their own business. This initiative will:REFORM OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO ENSURE THEY SERVE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND HOMEOWNERS Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is “not living up to its economic and community development goals.” While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Joe Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like:MAKE A HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO EQUALIZING FEDERAL PROCUREMENT AS PART OF HIS BOLD PROCUREMENT PLAN Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Black and Brown business owners; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will:Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support American workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively.ENSURE HIS HOUSING PLAN MAKES BOLD INVESTMENTS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE, AND AAPI FAMILIES Biden believes the middle class isn’t a number, but a value set that includes the ability to own your own home and live in a safe community. Housing should be a right, not a privilege. Today, however, far too many Americans lack access to affordable and quality housing. Racial inequality permeates U.S. housing markets, with homeownership rates for Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American households far below those of their white counterparts. Because home ownership is how many families save and build wealth, these racial disparities in home ownership contribute to the racial wealth gap. It is far past time to put an end to systemic housing discrimination and other contributors to this disparity. At the same time, many families around the country face immediate risk of eviction in the midst of the Trump-created economic crisis. In June, more than one-third of renters , including 49% of Hispanic families and 43% of Black families , were not sure that they could pay their next month’s rent. To prevent a catastrophic rise in evictions and homelessness, Congress and President Trump must act now by creating a broad emergency housing support program modeled on the steps the government takes to address natural disasters, in order to get help out quickly and at scale. To help families build wealth, secure a safe place to live in a vibrant and prosperous community, and ensure equal access to all aspects of the housing market, Biden will:See Joe Biden’s full housing plan at https://joebiden.com/housing/ ACHIEVE EQUITY IN MANAGEMENT, TRAINING, AND HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES CONNECTED TO JOBS OF THE FUTURE Stark racial disparities exist at every stage of our education system. These disparities compound and contribute to inequity in economic, health, housing, and criminal justice outcomes. As President, Biden will make significant investments into educational institutions and programs that are designed to elevate Black and Brown students. He will:BOOST RETIREMENT SECURITY AND FINANCIAL WEALT,Black and Brown families , and especially Black and Brown women , face disadvantages at every turn, from access to workplace retirement accounts to access to generational wealth. These disadvantages have resulted in large and persistent gaps in financial wealth. To help Black and Brown people have more opportunities to build up a nest egg, Biden will:ENSURE WORKERS OF COLOR ARE COMPENSATED FAIRLY AND TREATED WITH DIGNITY Workers of color still earn a fraction of white workers and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. In fact, the black-white wage gap persists across every level of education and is widening. And wage gaps are exacerbated for women of color with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women earning 68 cents, Black women earning 62 cents, Native women earning 57 cents, and Latinas earning 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adds up, on average, to roughly $1 million over a lifetime career, especially detrimental for the nearly 70% of Black mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden’s plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth.INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES Crumbling infrastructure is a barrier to growth and prosperity. If roads are falling apart; if lights and landscaping of public areas are not tended to; if sidewalks are dilapidated or schools are outdated; if there are no parks for kids to play in after school; if there is no fresh food for miles; if there are abandoned houses that need to be demolished or empty strip malls and not enough infrastructure to prevent fires; if there is nowhere to go when you are in a mental health crisis , how can a community thrive? We are the world’s richest nation, but for far too long Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American communities have been left behind. By making real and sustained investments into Black and Brown communities, we will create an environment where businesses and investments will multiply in size and strength. In Black and Brown communities the federal government will provide state, tribal, and local governments with resources to:Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes a national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future. He will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, toward that end. A major focus of this investment will be to upgrade the infrastructure and job opportunities in Black and Brown communities. Specifically, Biden will:See more details about the Biden infrastructure plans at https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/ and joebiden.com/clean-energy SECOND CHANCES FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS Biden believes in redemption. For people who are convicted of a crime, after they serve their sentence, they should have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy. It will not only benefit them, it will benefit all of society. It is also our best strategy to reduce recidivism. The collateral consequences for a criminal record are vast. The National Institute of Justice found that there are more than 44,000 collateral consequences nationwide, including employment restrictions, loss of voting rights, denial of housing or even renting an apartment and educational loan restrictions to name a few. Smart Data Infrastructure to Support Second Chances Most states already have a process for people who want to shield their criminal record from public view , expungement and sealing. But getting a person’s record expunged or sealed is complicated and requires paperwork, time, and sometimes the support of legal counsel. As President, Biden will advance a pathway for redemption and re-entry , and make real the possibility of second chances for all Americans , by helping states modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure and adopt automated record sealing for selected categories of non-violent offenses, to modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure. This data infrastructure will facilitate sealing of records in a manner that is precise, complete and efficient , so those records are not used to deny people jobs, housing, voting rights, school loans and other opportunities to rebuild their lives. The grants Biden is proposing will support state efforts to research, plan for, and ultimately implement the criminal record data infrastructure improvements that will make automated record relief possible. Beyond that, the infrastructure improvements will yield a general improvement in the operation and efficiency of state records. In addition, to invest in second chances and smart criminal justice reforms that will improve public safety, Biden will:STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FOCUS ON RACIAL ECONOMIC GAPS The Federal Reserve (the Fed) plays a highly influential role in determining the overall unemployment rate, as well as that of Black and Brown people. Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth. Biden will work with Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps , and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps. Access to affordable financial services is another first-order barrier to wealth building for many American families. Biden supports the Fed committing to a “real-time” payment system, a change the central bank has the authority to implement. With this system in place, instead of waiting days for checks to clear, low-income people will have instant access to money they are owed, ending an existing, costly burden to cash-constrained families. The Fed should also revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including at the leadership of the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. PRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMEN,INVEST IN A 21ST CENTURY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Black and Brown women , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden will:ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN AGRICULTURE Black, Brown and Native farmers have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Black, Brown and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Black, Latino, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complaints and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Black, Brown and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field. As President, Biden will build upon the historic progress made during the Obama-Biden administration, taking additional steps to support the rights of Black, Brown and Native farmers by:	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/the-biden-plan-to-build-back-better-by-advancing-racial-equity-across-the-american-economy-66ceb43d2a72?source=user_profile---------27----------------------------	EmptySummary					Joe Biden's jobs and economic recovery agenda is built on the proposition that we must build our economy back better than it was before the COVID-19 crisis.

In Black and Brown communities the federal government will provide state, tribal, and local governments with resources to:Biden's Build Back Better plan includes a national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future. He will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, toward that end. A major focus of this investment will be to upgrade the infrastructure and job opportunities in Black and Brown communities. Specifically, Biden will:See more details about the Biden infrastructure plans at and SECOND CHANCES FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS Biden believes in redemption. For people who are convicted of a crime, after they serve their sentence, they should have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy. It will not only benefit them, it will benefit all of society. It is also our best strategy to reduce recidivism. The collateral consequences for a criminal record are vast. The National Institute of Justice found that there are more than 44,000 collateral consequences nationwide, including employment restrictions, loss of voting rights, denial of housing or even renting an apartment and educational loan restrictions to name a few. Smart Data Infrastructure to Support Second Chances Most states already have a process for people who want to shield their criminal record from public view , expungement and sealing. But getting a person's record expunged or sealed is complicated and requires paperwork, time, and sometimes the support of legal counsel. As President, Biden will advance a pathway for redemption and re-entry , and make real the possibility of second chances for all Americans , by helping states modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure and adopt automated record sealing for selected categories of non-violent offenses, to modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure. This data infrastructure will facilitate sealing of records in a manner that is precise, complete and efficient , so those records are not used to deny people jobs, housing, voting rights, school loans and other opportunities to rebuild their lives. The grants Biden is proposing will support state efforts to research, plan for, and ultimately implement the criminal record data infrastructure improvements that will make automated record relief possible. Beyond that, the infrastructure improvements will yield a general improvement in the operation and efficiency of state records. In addition, to invest in second chances and smart criminal justice reforms that will improve public safety, Biden will:STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S FOCUS ON RACIAL ECONOMIC GAPS The Federal Reserve (the Fed) plays a highly influential role in determining the overall unemployment rate, as well as that of Black and Brown people. Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth. Biden will work with Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps , and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps. Access to affordable financial services is another first-order barrier to wealth building for many American families. Biden supports the Fed committing to a 'real-time' payment system, a change the central bank has the authority to implement. With this system in place, instead of waiting days for checks to clear, low-income people will have instant access to money they are owed, ending an existing, costly burden to cash-constrained families. The Fed should also revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution , including at the leadership of the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. PRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMEN,INVEST IN A 21ST CENTURY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country , to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. Caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Black and Brown women , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden will:ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN AGRICULTURE Black, Brown and Native farmers have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Black, Brown and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Black, Latino, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complaints and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Black, Brown and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field.
MEJB297202023	Joe Biden	2020-07-29	My Statement on Donald Trump’s Shameless Repeal of DACA	After failing at the Supreme Court, the Trump Administration took another cruel step in its misguided crusade to repeal DACA. President Trump will stop at nothing to push his anti-immigrant political agenda, even at the expense of young people who have grown up in this country and are Americans through and through.

Nearly a third of all current DACA recipients are essential workers helping our communities respond to the pandemic. Close to 30,000 of them are front-line health care workers. This November, voters must reject the politics that play with the lives of immigrant young people and jeopardize public health to divide families and rip apart communities. As President, I will protect Dreamers and their families and offer a roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and all 11 million undocumented immigrants enriching our country, so they no longer have to live in fear and uncertainty.

MEJB307202021	Joe Biden	2020-07-30	My Statement on the 55th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid	Fifty-five years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law , landmark programs that expanded the American social contract and reaffirmed the essential humanity, decency, and dignity of our nation. In an era when far far too many children, older Americans, and people living with disabilities went without the care they needed, our country stood up to declare for all time that no one who grows old or gets sick in America, regardless of their income, should be left to face their challenges alone. In doing so, we did more than just implement new health care programs , we strengthened the character and soul of our nation. In the years since, Medicare and Medicaid have extended lives, enhanced liberty, and put the pursuit of happiness within reach of tens of millions of Americans. They have delivered greater peace of mind and financial security to countless families, freeing them to plan their lives not around their fears, but around their dreams. And they have reminded us of the fundamental duty we all hold as Americans , the duty to care for one another. In the midst of a devastating pandemic, we should be united in our desire to strengthen these lifesaving programs , but instead, President Trump is once again threatening to cut them. That is deeply cruel and completely unacceptable.

MEJB18202019	Joe Biden	2020-08-01	My Statement on an Emergency Housing Package	Today is the first day of another month where rent and mortgage payments are due for millions of Americans who are already living on the edge. It comes a day after President Trump and Leader McConnell sent the Senate home for the weekend and allowed enhanced unemployment insurance, which millions of families have been using to pay their rent and bills, to lapse. And, the day after, we found out the last three months have been the worst period for our economy in recorded history. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses have shut their doors, with minority entrepreneurs especially hard hit. More than 30 million Americans are struggling to get by as their unemployment benefits are about to get sharply cut. Over the next two months, with no federal eviction moratorium in place, as many as 20 million families could find themselves out in the street without a safe place to live. Because Donald Trump is abdicating his responsibility to lead us out of the pandemic crisis and the economic crisis, we now face a potential housing crisis across the country. To prevent a catastrophic rise in evictions and homelessness, President Trump must work with Congress to act swiftly and enact a broad emergency housing support program for renters, just as we would in the aftermath of a natural disaster. Such a step would get help out quickly and at scale so that millions of people aren’t evicted or forced to choose between rent and food. Congress must also provide emergency unemployment benefits, greater access to food and nutrition programs, and full subsidies to allow families to keep their health insurance, so that the loss of one family member’s job doesn’t push the family into foreclosure and on the streets. This legislation must also include the fiscal relief necessary so state and local governments can keep on payroll the first responders, public school educators, and other public servants who ensure our cities and towns are clean, safe, and running. Combined, these steps could put the nation in a much stronger position to handle the strain the virus is putting on millions of Americans and our entire economy.

MEJB48202016	Joe Biden	2020-08-04	The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community	Joe Biden believes that the story of America is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The Latino community is a core part of the American community and their contributions are evident in every part of society. Our nation’s ability to draw and welcome hard-working, aspirational people from every culture, from every nation is an indisputable strength. Our diversity is the source of America’s constant renewal , the reason we’ve been able to remake ourselves over and over. President Trump’s assault on Latino dignity started on the very first day of his campaign. His assault doesn’t just reveal itself in the betrayal of the Dreamers or in the pardoning of a sheriff who has terrorized the Latino community. It’s in the underfunding of schools, in attacks on labor and the ability of workers to bargain for their worth, and in the neglect of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria. Trump’s strategy is to sow division , to cast out Latinos as being less than fully American. As President, Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity , no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or zip code. And, he will ensure that everyone has a chance to join the middle class, including Latinos and other individuals never given a fair shot in decades past. Today, a full quarter of all children in the U.S. are Latino. Our collective success depends upon the success of the Latino community. Biden will be ready beginning on Day 1 to implement changes needed for the Latino community to thrive. Biden will:Additionally, in recognition of the unique contributions of Latinos to American history over the past 500 years, Biden will work to establish a Smithsonian National American Latino Museum. Latino history is intricately woven into the history of America and must be preserved and celebrated. These vast contributions are long overdue to be recognized in the family of Smithsonian Museums. As an initial step, Biden will initiate a feasibility study and a site location for the museum. In July 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by voice vote , on a bipartisan basis , an act to establish this museum. Biden will also ensure that political appointees, including the President’s Cabinet, look like the country they serve, and ensure that our federal workforce is representative of the demographics in our country. The Obama-Biden Administration made great progress in building a diverse federal workforce, but Biden knows work remains for the country to fully realize the benefits of the talents, abilities, and perspectives of a workforce that looks like the country. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve and share Biden’s commitment to rigorous enforcement of civil rights protections. This includes promoting diverse leadership for all federal agencies including the financial regulatory agencies that have a direct impact on the nature of our entire economic system; working with all branches of government, including the Senate and Supreme Court, to create best practices and standards for ensuring racial diversity among clerks, staffers, and interns; and creating a new post within the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers to focus on racial equity including the income and wealth gaps. He also will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal government. He will rebuild the pipeline of workers into the federal government and incentivize more qualified workers to choose public service by forgiving $10,000 a year in student debt for up to five years of public service. He’ll tap into the best and brightest talent from every source by developing career pipelines from Hispanic-serving Institutions and other Minority-serving Institutions into federal agencies. Biden will also provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted. INVESTING IN LATINOS’ ECONOMIC MOBILITY Latinos fill essential roles throughout our economy. But many Latinos are stuck in low-wage jobs and have lower rates of homeownership and less wealth in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Biden is running for president to rebuild the middle class so that this time, everyone comes along, including Latinos. Supporting Public-Private Investment Through a New Small Business Opportunity Plan Small business ownership is one of our country’s cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. For example, Latinos are roughly 18% of the U.S. population but own less than 6% of small businesses with employees. Latino-owned firms also report lack of collateral as a top reason for credit denial. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Latinos, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , particularly for Latino-owned businesses and businesses owned by other people of color. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious “restart package” to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is proposing a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Reforming Opportunity Zones to Ensure They Serve Latino Communities, Small Businesses, and Homeowners Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is “not living up to its economic and community development goals.” While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like incentivizing Opportunity Funds to partner with nonprofit or community-oriented organizations and jointly produce a community-benefit plan for each investment. The focus should be on creating jobs for low-income residents and otherwise providing a direct financial impact to households within the Opportunity Zones. Make A Historic Commitment To Equalizing Federal Procurement Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Latino business owners and other business owners of color; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will require prime contractors to develop and fully execute plans to increase subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). He will also triple the federal goal for contracting with SDBs from 5% to a minimum of 15% of all procurement dollars by 2025. To achieve this goal, which will send tens of billions of additional dollars to Latino communities and other communities of color, Biden will expand long-term technical assistance and federal contracting preferences for SDBs. And, he will incentivize state and local governments and private sector partners to contract with small disadvantaged businesses. Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support Latino workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively. Ensure Latino Workers are Compensated Fairly and Treated With Dignity This pandemic has shown the world who essential workers really are , and many of them are Latino workers who feed the country, keep our communities clean, and care for our loved ones. But for too long they have not been treated with dignity or provided with the opportunity they deserve. Latino workers still earn a fraction of what white workers earn and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. And Latinas earn only 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adding up, on average, to over $1.1 million over a lifetime career. This is especially detrimental for the more than four in ten Latina mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden’s plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth. Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He will increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country and eliminate the minimum tipped wage, disproportionately benefitting Latino workers. He will also support small businesses like restaurants during this economic crisis, helping them get back on their feet so they can keep their doors open and pay their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration fought to extend overtime pay to over 4 million workers and protect nearly 9 million from losing it, but the Trump Administration reversed this progress, implementing a new rule that leaves millions of workers behind , including nearly 1.3 million Latino workers. Biden will ensure workers are paid fairly for the long hours they work and get the overtime pay they deserve. And he will ensure that domestic workers and farm workers receive overtime protections. Biden will address discrimination and harassment in the workplace, guarantee up to 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for all workers and up to seven days of paid sick, family, and safe leave. Approximately one in three Latino workers have experienced employment discrimination and nearly one in two Latino workers do not have access to any paid leave. And Biden will make it easier for all workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. Unions are an essential path to the middle class, especially for Latinos. They allow workers to bargain for higher wages and benefits, and with more job protections, many union workers have greater job stability. In fact, Latinos who join a union receive an even larger pay increase than white workers who join a union, helping to close the wage gap, and one study found Latino union members have 11 times the wealth of Latino non-union members. Biden will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of “employee” and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts. And, Biden will restore the ability of federal workers to unionize and collectively bargain.

Invest In A 21st Century Care Infrastructure Even before the pandemic, more than three in five Latino families lived in child care deserts, with limited to no access to licensed child care. When Latino families do find child care, they are paying over $200 a week , often more than they can afford. At the same time, caregivers and early childhood educators , disproportionately Latino women and other women of color , have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators. He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. This plan, combined with Biden’s proposal to provide families with up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, will put 3 million Americans to work in new care and education jobs, and increase overall employment by about 5 million after taking into account the economic impacts of increased labor force participation after unpaid caregivers , disproportionately women , are able to pursue paid careers if they so choose. Biden will:Read Biden’s full plan for a 21st century caregiving workforce at joebiden.com/caregiving. Make Bold Investments in Homeownership and Access to Affordable Housing for Latino Families Biden believes the middle class isn’t a number, but a value set that includes the ability to own your own home and live in a safe community. Housing should be a right, not a privilege.Today, however, far too many Americans lack access to affordable and quality housing. Racial inequality permeates U.S. housing markets, with the homeownership rate for Latino households far below those of their white counterparts. In fact, just 51% of Latinos own their own home, compared to 76% of non-Hispanic white Americans. Because home ownership is how many families save and build wealth, these racial disparities contribute to the racial wealth gap. At the same time, many families around the country face immediate risk of eviction in the midst of the Trump-created economic crisis. To help families build wealth, secure a safe place to live in a vibrant and prosperous community, and ensure equal access to all aspects of the housing market, Biden will help families buy their first homes and build wealth by creating a new refundable, advanceable tax credit of up to $15,000. Biden’s First Down Payment Tax Credit will help low- and middle-income families offset the costs of home buying and help millions of families lay down roots for the first time. Biden will also:Invest In Infrastructure In Latino Communities Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes a national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future. He will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, toward that end. A major focus of this investment will be to upgrade the infrastructure and job opportunities in Latino communities and other communities of color.

Address Longstanding Inequities in Agriculture Latino farmers and other farmers of color have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice. For more than 100 years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Latino, Black, and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Latino, Black, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complainants and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. A profound shift occurred for Latino, Black, and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden Administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump Administration , which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field. As President, Biden will build upon the historic progress made during the Obama-Biden Administration, taking additional steps to support the rights of Latino, Black, and Native farmers by establishing an equity commission that will focus on the unique jurisdictional and regulatory barriers that Latino, Black, and Native farmers, ranchers, and fishers must negotiate and make sure that processes are streamlined and simplified to promote new and beginning farming and ranching operations by Latino, Black, and Native farmers. Biden will advance a comprehensive effort to assist in both the purchase of farmland and the ability of Latino, Black, and Native farmers to keep that land. This includes credit and technical support in the form of expedited credit, low-interest loans, and technical assistance. In addition, Biden recognizes the disadvantage that Latino, Black, and Native farmers face when they are forced to compete with other farmers who have decades of privileged access to federal assistance. As President, he will explore the use of land trusts, cooperative farm operations, and farm credit systems geared towards Latino, Black, and, Native farmers as a means to support this population and diversify our agricultural sector. Farmworkers , who are disproportionately Latino and immigrant workers , have always been essential to working our farms and feeding our country. As President, Biden will ensure farmworkers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, regardless of immigration status. He will work with Congress to provide legal status based on prior agricultural work history, ensure they can earn paid sick time, and require that labor and safety rules, including overtime, humane living conditions, and protection from pesticide and heat exposure, are strictly enforced.

MAKE FAR REACHING INVESTMENTS TO END HEALTH DISPARITIES BY RACE The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the long-standing, pervasive disparities that exist across our health care system due to unequal access to treatment. While we are still learning about the impact of COVID-19 , a clear pattern has emerged that suggests Latino communities are bearing disproportionate harm from the pandemic. Latinos are at an increased risk both of getting COVID-19 and of experiencing severe illness. Latinos are more than four times more likely to experience hospitalization due to COVID-19 than non-Hispanic white persons. President Trump should work with Congress to immediately enact Senator Kamala Harris’ bill to create a task force to address the racial disparities that have been laid bare by this pandemic. As President, Biden will do everything in his power to eliminate health care disparities. Ensuring access to health care during this crisis In the short term, Biden’s COVID-19 response plan calls on the Trump Administration to drop its support of a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. Millions of Americans have already lost their health insurance because they lost their job, and millions more may find health care increasingly difficult to afford. During this crisis, Biden would expand access to quality, affordable health care for all through:Ensuring access to affordable, high-quality health care beyond the crisis Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition , whether cancer or diabetes or heart disease or a mental health challenge. Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Millions of Latinos obtained the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Young people who are in transition from school to a job have the option to stay covered by their parents’ plan until age 26. As a result, the uninsured rate among Latinos plummeted from 32% to 19% in the wake of Obamacare , the most substantial decrease of any racial or ethnic group. Now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Latinos who depend on the Affordable Care Act. If President Trump is successful in his efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, some estimates show that one in ten Latinos under age 65 will lose their health insurance. As President, Biden will build on Obamacare to expand Latinos’ access to quality, affordable care. He will:Investing in Hispanic-serving Institutions to Help Solve Health Disparities As part of Biden’s more than $70 billion investment in Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), other Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), he will invest $10 billion to create at least 200 new centers of excellence that serve as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation’s future to learning and career opportunities. He will develop robust internship and career pipelines at major research agencies, including National Institutes of Health. He will also dedicate additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HSIs, other MSIs, and HBCUs. He will require any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HSI, other MSI, or HBCU. And, Biden will invest $5 billion in graduate programs in health care, along with teaching and STEM, at these schools. Read Biden’s full health care plan at joebiden.com/healthcare. EXPAND ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND TACKLE RACIAL INEQUITY IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM Over a quarter of K-12 public school students are Latino. Biden will make sure that every child in America has the chance to realize their full potential starting at birth, regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. Biden will work with states to ensure every low- and middle-income family has access to high-quality child care and to make high-quality pre-K available to every child. He’ll close the gap between white and non-white school districts by nearly tripling Title I funding, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework , including computer science and other STEM subjects , across all their schools, not just a few. He’ll expand “community schools” that serve the needs of students and parents; and double the number of school psychologists, nurses, school counselors, and social workers, giving kids the support they need to grow. Biden will work to ensure that more public schools have additional resources to support English learners and ensure their parents receive information in the language they understand so they can participate in their child’s education. And, through partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers, Biden will make sure that all kids have a chance to graduate with an industry credential, ready to compete in the 21st century workforce. Biden will also expand access for Latinos to quality, affordable education and training beyond high school. For too many, earning a degree or other credential after high school is unaffordable today. For others, their education saddles them with so much debt it prevents them from buying a home or saving for retirement, or their parents or grandparents take on some of the financial burden. But roughly six in ten jobs require some education beyond high school. Biden will:Read Biden’s full education plans at joebiden.com/education and joebiden.com/beyondHS. COMBAT HATE CRIMES AND GUN VIOLENCE Last year, a single gunman killed 23 individuals in El Paso. He picked this city because of its diversity, rich Hispanic heritage, and close friendship with the people of Ciudad Juarez. This horrific tragedy, part of a disturbing increase in anti-Latino hate crimes, calls on all of us to recommit to the battle for the soul of the nation. According to the FBI, reported anti-Latino hate incidents increased by more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2018. We must fight against white supremacy, which President Trump has emboldened. And we must fight against gun violence in all of its forms , mass shootings and the daily acts of gun violence that don’t make headlines but are just as tragic for the families and communities affected. Biden will pursue evidence-based measures to root out persistent violent crime and hate crimes. Violent offenders need to be held accountable, and survivors need to have access to support to deal with the physical, psychological, and financial consequences of violence. Biden will tackle the rise in hate crimes through moral leadership that makes clear such vitriol has no place in the United States. And, in the Biden Administration, the Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes. Additionally, Biden will address the daily acts of gun violence in our communities that may not make national headlines, but are just as devastating to survivors and victims’ families as gun violence that does make the front page. These daily acts of gun violence disproportionately impact Latinos and Black people. Biden will create a $900 million, eight-year initiative to fund evidence-based interventions in 40 cities across the country , the 20 cities with the highest number of homicides, and 20 cities with the highest number of homicides per capita. This proposal is estimated to save more than 12,000 lives over the eight-year program. Read Biden’s full plan to reduce gun violence at joebiden.com/gunsafety. SECURE OUR VALUES AS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It’s wrong, and it stops when Biden is elected President. The current Administration’s racist and wrong-headed immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis on our border, undermined a key source of our economic strength, and weakened our moral standing in the world. Biden knows that it’s past time to overhaul our broken immigration system. As Vice President, he backed reforms that would have established a path to citizenship and when Congress failed to pass them, the Obama-Biden Administration created and then expanded the DACA program to give Dreamers a chance to pursue their lives without fear of deportation. On his first day in office, Biden will send to Congress a bill for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship. Biden knows that we can secure our borders and uphold our laws in a way that is humane, just, and that establishes a rational set of rules for aspiring immigrants. He will invest in smart technology that addresses the real threats to U.S. security, ones that primarily come to our country through our legal ports of entry, and he’ll restore our asylum system so that it once more offers protection and safe harbor to people fleeing dangers. He’ll ensure those seeking refuge in the United States are treated with dignity and get the fair hearing they’re legally entitled to receive, and surge the resources to hire more immigration judges and asylum officers to address the current crisis. Moreover, a Biden Administration will immediately review every Temporary Protected Status (TPS) decision made by the Trump Administration to ensure that no one is returned to a country that is not safe, extend TPS to Venezuelans seeking relief from the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime, and offer TPS recipients who have been in the country for an extended period of time a path to citizenship through legislative immigration reform. Reverse the Harmful Immigration Policies of the Trump Administration As President, Biden will take urgent action to end the Trump Administration’s violations of human dignity and restore our nation’s moral leadership by:Permanent Immigration Reform Through Legislative Action As President, Biden will commit significant political capital to finally deliver legislative immigration reform to ensure that the U.S. remains open and welcoming to people from every part of the world , and to bring hardworking people who have enriched our communities and our country, in some cases for decades, out of the shadows. Specifically, Joe Biden will work with Congress to pass legislation that:Read Biden’s full immigration plan at joebiden.com/immigration.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/the-biden-agenda-for-the-latino-community-4d7329c2644b?source=user_profile---------18----------------------------	EmptySummary					Joe Biden believes that the story of America is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The Latino community is a core part of the American community and their contributions are evident in every part of society. Our nation's ability to draw and welcome hard-working, aspirational people from every culture, from every nation is an indisputable strength. Our diversity is the source of America's constant renewal , the reason we've been able to remake ourselves over and over. President Trump's assault on Latino dignity started on the very first day of his campaign. His assault doesn't just reveal itself in the betrayal of the Dreamers or in the pardoning of a sheriff who has terrorized the Latino community. It's in the underfunding of schools, in attacks on labor and the ability of workers to bargain for their worth, and in the neglect of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria. Trump's strategy is to sow division , to cast out Latinos as being less than fully American. As President, Biden will ensure everyone is treated with dignity , no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or zip code. And, he will ensure that everyone has a chance to join the middle class, including Latinos and other individuals never given a fair shot in decades past. Today, a full quarter of all children in the U.S. are Latino. Our collective success depends upon the success of the Latino community. Biden will be ready beginning on Day 1 to implement changes needed for the Latino community to thrive. Biden will:Additionally, in recognition of the unique contributions of Latinos to American history over the past 500 years, Biden will work to establish a Smithsonian National American Latino Museum. Latino history is intricately woven into the history of America and must be preserved and celebrated. These vast contributions are long overdue to be recognized in the family of Smithsonian Museums. As an initial step, Biden will initiate a feasibility study and a site location for the museum. In July 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by voice vote , on a bipartisan basis , an act to establish this museum. Biden will also ensure that political appointees, including the President's Cabinet, look like the country they serve, and ensure that our federal workforce is representative of the demographics in our country. The Obama-Biden Administration made great progress in building a diverse federal workforce, but Biden knows work remains for the country to fully realize the benefits of the talents, abilities, and perspectives of a workforce that looks like the country. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve and share Biden's commitment to rigorous enforcement of civil rights protections. This includes promoting diverse leadership for all federal agencies including the financial regulatory agencies that have a direct impact on the nature of our entire economic system; working with all branches of government, including the Senate and Supreme Court, to create best practices and standards for ensuring racial diversity among clerks, staffers, and interns; and creating a new post within the White House's Council of Economic Advisers to focus on racial equity including the income and wealth gaps. He also will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden executive order to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal government. He will rebuild the pipeline of workers into the federal government and incentivize more qualified workers to choose public service by forgiving $10,000 a year in student debt for up to five years of public service. He'll tap into the best and brightest talent from every source by developing career pipelines from Hispanic-serving Institutions and other Minority-serving Institutions into federal agencies. Biden will also provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted. INVESTING IN LATINOS' ECONOMIC MOBILITY Latinos fill essential roles throughout our economy. But many Latinos are stuck in low-wage jobs and have lower rates of homeownership and less wealth in comparison to non-Hispanic whites. Biden is running for president to rebuild the middle class so that this time, everyone comes along, including Latinos. Supporting Public-Private Investment Through a New Small Business Opportunity Plan Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. For example, Latinos are roughly 18% of the U.S. population but own less than 6% of small businesses with employees. Latino-owned firms also report lack of collateral as a top reason for credit denial. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Latinos, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas , particularly for Latino-owned businesses and businesses owned by other people of color. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious 'restart package' to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is proposing a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:Reforming Opportunity Zones to Ensure They Serve Latino Communities, Small Businesses, and Homeowners Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is 'not living up to its economic and community development goals.' While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like incentivizing Opportunity Funds to partner with nonprofit or community-oriented organizations and jointly produce a community-benefit plan for each investment. The focus should be on creating jobs for low-income residents and otherwise providing a direct financial impact to households within the Opportunity Zones. Make A Historic Commitment To Equalizing Federal Procurement Biden's Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle long standing inequities in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Latino business owners and other business owners of color; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will require prime contractors to develop and fully execute plans to increase subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). He will also triple the federal goal for contracting with SDBs from 5% to a minimum of 15% of all procurement dollars by 2025. To achieve this goal, which will send tens of billions of additional dollars to Latino communities and other communities of color, Biden will expand long-term technical assistance and federal contracting preferences for SDBs. And, he will incentivize state and local governments and private sector partners to contract with small disadvantaged businesses. Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support Latino workers and their families. As called for in his plan to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively. Ensure Latino Workers are Compensated Fairly and Treated With Dignity This pandemic has shown the world who essential workers really are , and many of them are Latino workers who feed the country, keep our communities clean, and care for our loved ones. But for too long they have not been treated with dignity or provided with the opportunity they deserve. Latino workers still earn a fraction of what white workers earn and are less likely to have essential benefits like health coverage and paid leave. And Latinas earn only 54 cents for every dollar a white man earns, adding up, on average, to over $1.1 million over a lifetime career. This is especially detrimental for the more than four in ten Latina mothers who are the sole or primary breadwinners for their family. Biden's plan to build back better requires rooting out discrimination in the workplace so people can earn what they deserve, support their families, and build wealth. Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. He will increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country and eliminate the minimum tipped wage, disproportionately benefitting Latino workers. He will also support small businesses like restaurants during this economic crisis, helping them get back on their feet so they can keep their doors open and pay their workers. The Obama-Biden Administration fought to extend overtime pay to over 4 million workers and protect nearly 9 million from losing it, but the Trump Administration reversed this progress, implementing a new rule that leaves millions of workers behind , including nearly 1.3 million Latino workers. Biden will ensure workers are paid fairly for the long hours they work and get the overtime pay they deserve. And he will ensure that domestic workers and farm workers receive overtime protections. Biden will address discrimination and harassment in the workplace, guarantee up to 12 weeks paid family and medical leave for all workers and up to seven days of paid sick, family, and safe leave. Approximately one in three Latino workers have experienced employment discrimination and nearly one in two Latino workers do not have access to any paid leave. And Biden will make it easier for all workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. Unions are an essential path to the middle class, especially for Latinos. They allow workers to bargain for higher wages and benefits, and with more job protections, many union workers have greater job stability. In fact, Latinos who join a union receive an even larger pay increase than white workers who join a union, helping to close the wage gap, and one study found Latino union members have 11 times the wealth of Latino non-union members. Biden will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of 'employee' and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts.

Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Millions of Latinos obtained the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Young people who are in transition from school to a job have the option to stay covered by their parents' plan until age 26. As a result, the uninsured rate among Latinos plummeted from 32% to 19% in the wake of Obamacare , the most substantial decrease of any racial or ethnic group. Now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Latinos who depend on the Affordable Care Act. If President Trump is successful in his efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act, some estimates show that one in ten Latinos under age 65 will lose their health insurance. As President, Biden will build on Obamacare to expand Latinos' access to quality, affordable care. Investing in Hispanic-serving Institutions to Help Solve Health Disparities As part of Biden's more than $70 billion investment in Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), other Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), he will invest $10 billion to create at least 200 new centers of excellence that serve as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation's future to learning and career opportunities. He will develop robust internship and career pipelines at major research agencies, including National Institutes of Health. He will also dedicate additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HSIs, other MSIs, and HBCUs. He will require any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HSI, other MSI, or HBCU. And, Biden will invest $5 billion in graduate programs in health care, along with teaching and STEM, at these schools.

Biden will make sure that every child in America has the chance to realize their full potential starting at birth, regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. Biden will work with states to ensure every low- and middle-income family has access to high-quality child care and to make high-quality pre-K available to every child. He'll close the gap between white and non-white school districts by nearly tripling Title I funding, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework , including computer science and other STEM subjects , across all their schools, not just a few. He'll expand 'community schools' that serve the needs of students and parents; and double the number of school psychologists, nurses, school counselors, and social workers, giving kids the support they need to grow. Biden will work to ensure that more public schools have additional resources to support English learners and ensure their parents receive information in the language they understand so they can participate in their child's education. And, through partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers, Biden will make sure that all kids have a chance to graduate with an industry credential, ready to compete in the 21st century workforce. Biden will also expand access for Latinos to quality, affordable education and training beyond high school. For too many, earning a degree or other credential after high school is unaffordable today. For others, their education saddles them with so much debt it prevents them from buying a home or saving for retirement, or their parents or grandparents take on some of the financial burden. But roughly six in ten jobs require some education beyond high school.

He picked this city because of its diversity, rich Hispanic heritage, and close friendship with the people of Ciudad Juarez. This horrific tragedy, part of a disturbing increase in anti-Latino hate crimes, calls on all of us to recommit to the battle for the soul of the nation. According to the FBI, reported anti-Latino hate incidents increased by more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2018. We must fight against white supremacy, which President Trump has emboldened. And we must fight against gun violence in all of its forms , mass shootings and the daily acts of gun violence that don't make headlines but are just as tragic for the families and communities affected. Biden will pursue evidence-based measures to root out persistent violent crime and hate crimes. Violent offenders need to be held accountable, and survivors need to have access to support to deal with the physical, psychological, and financial consequences of violence. Biden will tackle the rise in hate crimes through moral leadership that makes clear such vitriol has no place in the United States. And, in the Biden Administration, the Justice Department will prioritize prosecuting hate crimes. Additionally, Biden will address the daily acts of gun violence in our communities that may not make national headlines, but are just as devastating to survivors and victims' families as gun violence that does make the front page. These daily acts of gun violence disproportionately impact Latinos and Black people. Biden will create a $900 million, eight-year initiative to fund evidence-based interventions in 40 cities across the country , the 20 cities with the highest number of homicides, and 20 cities with the highest number of homicides per capita. This proposal is estimated to save more than 12,000 lives over the eight-year program. Read Biden's full plan to reduce gun violence at SECURE OUR VALUES AS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It's wrong, and it stops when Biden is elected President. The current Administration's racist and wrong-headed immigration policies have created a humanitarian crisis on our border, undermined a key source of our economic strength, and weakened our moral standing in the world. Biden knows that it's past time to overhaul our broken immigration system. As Vice President, he backed reforms that would have established a path to citizenship and when Congress failed to pass them, the Obama-Biden Administration created and then expanded the DACA program to give Dreamers a chance to pursue their lives without fear of deportation. On his first day in office, Biden will send to Congress a bill for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship. Biden knows that we can secure our borders and uphold our laws in a way that is humane, just, and that establishes a rational set of rules for aspiring immigrants. He will invest in smart technology that addresses the real threats to U.S. security, ones that primarily come to our country through our legal ports of entry, and he'll restore our asylum system so that it once more offers protection and safe harbor to people fleeing dangers. He'll ensure those seeking refuge in the United States are treated with dignity and get the fair hearing they're legally entitled to receive, and surge the resources to hire more immigration judges and asylum officers to address the current crisis. Moreover, a Biden Administration will immediately review every Temporary Protected Status (TPS) decision made by the Trump Administration to ensure that no one is returned to a country that is not safe, extend TPS to Venezuelans seeking relief from the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime, and offer TPS recipients who have been in the country for an extended period of time a path to citizenship through legislative immigration reform. Reverse the Harmful Immigration Policies of the Trump Administration As President, Biden will take urgent action to end the Trump Administration's violations of human dignity and restore our nation's moral leadership by:Permanent Immigration Reform Through Legislative Action As President, Biden will commit significant political capital to finally deliver legislative immigration reform to ensure that the U.S. remains open and welcoming to people from every part of the world , and to bring hardworking people who have enriched our communities and our country, in some cases for decades, out of the shadows. Specifically, Joe Biden will work with Congress to pass legislation that:Read Biden's full immigration plan at
MEJB58202015	Joe Biden	2020-08-05	My Statement on Trump’s Failing Trade Deal with China	New trade figures today confirm what President Trump’s own advisors already admitted: Trump’s “phase one” trade deal with China is failing , badly. Trump hasn’t even managed to secure half of China’s purchase commitments under the agreement. This is only the latest setback for a deal that has failed to deliver for the American people literally every step of the way. Even before the pandemic, Trump’s go-it-alone trade war was hammering American workers, small businesses, and farmers: sharply increasing the U.S. trade deficit, causing a spike in farm bankruptcies, and helping to sink American manufacturing into recession. Desperate to distract the country from his disastrous trade policy, Trump settled for a hollow, unenforceable “phase one” deal with Beijing that failed to address the Chinese government’s illegal and unfair trade practices. The deal was full of vague, weak, and recycled commitments from Beijing. Under Trump’s deal, the Chinese government continues unabated providing harmful subsidies to its state-owned enterprises, stealing America’s ideas, and forcing U.S. companies to give away their trade secrets. Add this to the list of Trump’s catastrophic failures on China. He was so desperate for his weak trade deal that he gave China’s leaders a pass as the coronavirus was spreading to the United States and turned a blind eye to the brutal crackdown in Hong Kong. On every relevant metric since Trump took office, Beijing’s position is stronger and America’s is weaker. The United States needs a President who has a record of standing up to Beijing and getting results. My Build Back Better plan positions America to out-compete China through massive support for American manufacturers, a credible commitment to reshoring and protecting U.S. supply chains, and unprecedented investment in American innovation. I’ll rally our allies to set the rules of the road and push back on Beijing’s aggressive and predatory behavior.

MEJB68202013	Joe Biden	2020-08-06	My Statement on the 55th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act	In our lifetime Americans have been beaten, bloodied, and murdered because they wanted to vote. For Black Americans, their fundamental right was denied by white supremacy hiding behind white hoods and in plain sight in legislatures, police stations, and courtrooms. But those torches and burning crosses, the batons, fire hoses, attack dogs, and unfair laws and trials could deny that right for only so long. On March 7, 1965, John Lewis and hundreds of brave and righteous souls risked their lives to cross a bridge in Selma named after a Klansman to reach the other side of justice. The blood spilled that Sunday turned the tide that for too long suppressed the rights of our fellow Americans. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act a few months later. And on this day 55 years ago, August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed it into law with Dr. King and John Lewis standing watch as angels on the nation’s shoulder. It began to dismantle barriers to voting and make our elections more fair, free and representative. I was always proud to vote to reauthorize it over the years. But Republicans at every level chipped away at it with restrictive voting laws under the false flag of “voter fraud.” And in 2013 the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, holding that times have changed and blatant voter discrimination was rare, contrary to the assault on the ground. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.” Today, it’s still pouring. In 2019, more than half the states , 29 , introduced or carried over at least 87 bills to make it harder to vote. Every election cycle repeats the story of voters of color standing in line for hours and hours. The House passed a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, later renamed in John Lewis’ memory. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans refuse to bring the bill up for a vote, while they continue to stack the courts with judges who don’t believe in it. And Donald Trump uses the pandemic as an excuse to continue denying Americans the right to vote and undermine the integrity of our elections. We’ve seen this story before in our lifetime. It’s still un-American. Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted. If you have the best ideas , you have nothing to hide. Let more people vote. It’s simple. As President, I will work to enact the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The battle for the soul for America has many fronts; the right to vote is the most fundamental.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-55th-anniversary-of-the-voting-rights-act-aab7b06bbbe?source=user_profile---------15----------------------------	EmptySummary					In our lifetime Americans have been beaten, bloodied, and murdered because they wanted to vote.

MEJB68202014	Joe Biden	2020-08-06	My Statement on the 75th Anniversary of Hiroshima	On this date, 75 years ago, the nuclear age arrived, when the United States became the first, and so far only, country to use a nuclear weapon in war. The scenes of death and destruction, first from Hiroshima and then Nagasaki, still horrify us, three-quarters of a century later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict, and our collective responsibility to ensure that such weapons are never again used.For decades, American leaders of both parties have understood that the United States has a national security imperative and a moral responsibility to reduce nuclear threats, including by negotiating treaties and agreements to control and eventually eliminate these weapons. It was this essential diplomacy that provided strategic stability during the dangerous Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union and that galvanized the international community to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. It’s why the Obama-Biden administration led the diplomatic effort that put Iran’s nuclear ambitions under lock and key, negotiated the New START Treaty with Russia to verifiably reduce both countries’ nuclear arsenals to their lowest level in six decades, and reduced the dangers of nuclear terrorism through the work of four Nuclear Security Summits.These efforts made America, and her allies and partners, safer. But, as with so much else, Donald Trump has squandered this inheritance. The Trump administration has systematically eroded or abandoned multiple international agreements, with no regard for the consequences and no plan for anything to replace them. He has lessened our leadership and weakened our security for nothing. Trump’s showmanship with North Korea has not constrained its growing nuclear arsenal. His withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has only put Iran back on the path toward a nuclear weapon and cost us the confidence of our allies and partners in the process. His administration has even considered recklessly returning to nuclear testing. These repeated failures of leadership and judgement have yielded a more dangerous world.Today, on this solemn anniversary, we must all recommit to our ultimate goal , a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons. That work begins with the United States and Russia agreeing to extend the New START Treaty, an act of statesmanship that would be welcomed by nations around the world. But it must not end there. As President, I will restore American leadership on arms control and nonproliferation as a central pillar of U.S. global leadership. I will strengthen our alliances to keep the American people safe from nuclear and other global threats. And I will work to bring us closer to a world without nuclear weapons, so that the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are never repeated.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-75th-anniversary-of-hiroshima-62f85e3a7538?source=user_profile---------16----------------------------	EmptySummary					On this date, 75 years ago, the nuclear age arrived, when the United States became the first, and so far only, country to use a nuclear weapon in war.

It did not have to be this bad. We are in a deeper economic hole than we should be because of Donald Trump’s historic failure to respond to the pandemic, and the pace of recovery has now slowed because of Trump’s continuing inability to come up with a plan to control the virus. Unemployment claims keep breaking historical records. Millions of small businesses are on the brink of closing for good.

MEJB7820209	Joe Biden	2020-08-07	My Statement on the Grand Canyon	The Grand Canyon is first among the landmarks of our nation , holy to the Tribes who preserve it and call it home, and sacred to all Americans. This national treasure attracts millions of visitors each year, supporting thousands of jobs for Arizonans and contributing more than $1 billion to the state economy. But where virtually every American sees an irreplaceable jewel, Donald Trump sees yet another opportunity to fracture something inviolable for profit. By opening the door to mining companies to extract uranium from the Grand Canyon, Trump is threatening to deface the natural splendor of our nation, poison the land and water relied on by local communities, and drive a drill into the heart of one of Arizona’s cultural and economic cornerstones. Already, the federal government is cleaning up uranium contamination in Navajo Nation and studying its potential impact on health concerns ranging from kidney illness to cancer. Once again, Donald Trump is proving that there is nothing in America that is sacred to him.Any suggestion that we cannot create jobs or increase our energy competitiveness without spoiling historically, environmentally, and culturally significant public lands is false and disgraceful. As Vice President, I helped oversee record job growth and a dramatic reduction in America’s reliance on foreign energy sources , including by implementing the largest clean energy investments in our nation’s history , while protecting and bolstering our public lands and the local economies they support.

Americans must come together to preserve our sacred spaces, build a new economy grounded in dignity and respect, and put an end to Donald Trump's defacement of our nation.
MEJB8820208	Joe Biden	2020-08-08	My Statement on Bristol Bay	Bristol Bay has been foundational to the way of life of Alaska Natives for countless generations, provides incredible joy for recreational anglers from across the country, and is an economic powerhouse that supplies half of the world’s wild sockeye salmon. It is no place for a mine. The Obama-Biden Administration reached that conclusion when we ran a rigorous, science-based process in 2014, and it is still true today. The only reason we are still debating whether Pebble Mine should move forward is because hours after former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt met with a mining executive behind closed doors, the Trump Administration reversed our thoughtful decision. Now, Alaskan culture, traditions, and jobs are on the line. As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay , and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-bristol-bay-1a83d60a2986?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------	EmptySummary					Bristol Bay has been foundational to the way of life of Alaska Natives for countless generations, provides incredible joy for recreational anglers from across the country, and is an economic powerhouse that supplies half of the world's wild sockeye salmon.

MEJB9820206	Joe Biden	2020-08-09	My Statement on Five Million COVID-19 Infections	Today we passed five million reported infections of COVID-19 in the United States. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Five million is more than the entire population of Alabama , or of more than half the states in our union, for that matter. Each time the number clicks up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. And for the families of the more than 160,000 souls who have died because of this virus, it is a pain that can never be undone.My heart goes out to all those who have been touched by the pandemic , to those who have lost loved ones, lost their income, lost their peace of mind. I know that for many Americans, especially as the months continue to drag on, there are moments when the losses feel unbearable. But we must not give up. We must follow the science and the advice of medical experts , starting with wearing a mask. That is how we will beat this virus.And yet, we continue to hear little more from President Trump than excuses and lies in an effort to cover for his repeated failures of leadership , failures that worsened the pandemic here at home, and in turn deepened our economic crisis. It should never have gotten this bad. No other country in the world has been hit as hard as we have. No other high-income economy is still struggling to get this under control. In fact, Americans are no longer welcome in much of the world, because we are seen as a public health threat. And we are where we are today for one simple, infuriating reason: Trump waved the white flag and gave up. He didn’t want to deal with the pandemic, so he stopped trying. He didn’t do his job.Trump has already thrown away months of the American people’s sacrifice and hard work. Imagine what four more years of his failures will cost us.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-five-million-covid-19-infections-82c282c935b1?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today we passed five million reported infections of COVID-19 in the United States.

MEJB9820207	Joe Biden	2020-08-09	My Statement on President Trump’s Executive Orders to Sow More Chaos and Confusion	Unable to deliver for the American people in a time of crisis, Donald Trump offered a series of half-baked measures today. He is putting Social Security at grave risk at a time when seniors are suffering the overwhelming impact of a pandemic he has failed to get under control. And make no mistake: Donald Trump said today that if he is re-elected, he will defund Social Security.For months, Trump has golfed rather than negotiated, and sown division rather than pull people together to get a package passed. Now, instead of staying in Washington and working with Republicans and Democrats to reach a bipartisan deal, President Trump is at his golf club in New Jersey signing a series of dubious executive orders.This is no art of the deal. This is not presidential leadership. These orders are not real solutions. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility. Some measures do far more harm than good.One order is Donald Trump’s first shot in a new, reckless war on Social Security. Trump announced a payroll tax plan with no protections or guarantees , like the ones the Obama-Biden administration enforced a decade ago , that the Social Security Trust Fund will be made whole. And, Trump specifically stated today that if re-elected, he plans to undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security. He is laying out his roadmap to cutting Social Security. Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without Trump putting their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt.Another order brings cuts, chaos, and confusion to our system of unemployment insurance. Trump is unilaterally reducing the amount laid-off workers could receive. And he purports to provide these benefits until the end of the year, but only identifies enough funding to make it a handful of weeks. Even with that limited funding, Trump is basically playing a cruel game of robbing Peter to pay Paul: He is taking billions of dollars of federal natural disaster funding away so it won’t be available to states like Florida. And, he is forcing states to choose between imposing benefit cuts for unemployed workers or slashing funds for public schools, health workers, and first responders.A third order, on evictions, is woefully inadequate to deal with the emerging housing crisis. He is leaving our nation’s renters with ever-mounting debt and leaving our small family landlords badly squeezed. Without a comprehensive plan to help our American families make rent, they will leave this crisis months behind on their payments while many landlords teeter on the verge of bankruptcy.And a fourth order is a band-aid approach to student debt that leaves out 7 million borrowers who obtained their federal loans from private lenders or their college rather than the Department. The economic strain on these Americans is deep and unrelenting.There is a solution to all of this pain and suffering. A real leader would go back to Washington, call together the leaders of the House and Senate, and negotiate a deal that delivers real relief to Americans who are struggling in this pandemic. We need a president who understands their struggle and believes in their courage to overcome.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-president-trumps-executive-orders-to-sow-more-chaos-and-876805b13d08?source=user_profile---------8----------------------------	EmptySummary					Unable to deliver for the American people in a time of crisis, Donald Trump offered a series of half-baked measures today.

MEJB13820203	Joe Biden	2020-08-13	My Statement on the Agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates	Today, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East. The UAE’s offer to publicly recognize the State of Israel is a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship. And it is a critical recognition that Israel is a vibrant, integral part of the Middle East that is here to stay. Israel can and will be a valued strategic and economic partner to all who welcome it.The coming together of Israel and Arab states builds on the efforts of multiple administrations to foster a broader Arab-Israeli opening, including the efforts of the Obama-Biden administration to build on the Arab Peace Initiative. I personally spent time with leaders of both Israel and the UAE during our administration building the case for cooperation and broader engagement and the benefits it could deliver to both nations, and I am gratified by today’s announcement.It is a timely reminder that enmities and differences , even long standing ones , are not set in stone, and of the role American diplomacy can play. There is always room for cooperation and collaboration on areas of mutual interest, and the Emirates and Israel both share a keen interest in preserving the prospects for peace in the region. Annexation would be a body blow to the cause of peace, which is why I oppose it now and would oppose it as president. It would virtually end any chance of a two-state solution that would secure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state and uphold the right of Palestinians to a state of their own. By forestalling that possibility and replacing it with the hope of greater connection and integration in the region, the United Arab Emirates and Israel have pointed a path toward a more peaceful, stable Middle East. A Biden-Harris Administration will seek to build on this progress, and will challenge all the nations of the region to keep pace.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-agreement-between-israel-and-the-united-arab-emirates-3da70088e519?source=user_profile---------4----------------------------	EmptySummary					Today, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have taken a historic step to bridge the deep divides of the Middle East.

MEJB13820204	Joe Biden	2020-08-13	My Statement on the Third Anniversary of the Right-Wing Protests in Charlottesville	Three years ago today, the world watched in horror as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and far-right extremists with torches in hand descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Hitler’s Germany in the 1930s. It was a moment of testing for our country, and a wake-up call to the fact that hate never dies , it only hides. And when our leaders give it oxygen, it can come roaring back to life.What happened next is seared in all our memories , a violent clash between the white nationalists and those who came together to stand against hate. Tragically, a brave young woman lost her life.And then our president claimed that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Donald Trump had the audacity to assign moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those who stood against it.I knew then that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And I knew then that I could not stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the core values of this nation. Now, three years later, we can see even more clearly that everything that has made America, America, is at stake.Despite our imperfections as a nation, the American people have never given up or walked away from the founding ideals of our nation: that everyone is entitled to be treated equally and with dignity and respect. That is who we are. And together, we are far more powerful than the hatred we saw on that dark day three years ago, and in so many acts of hatred and violence since.As we look ahead to the choice we must make as a country this November, let Charlottesville be a reminder of the national imperative we all share: to weed out the division that the president has created over the last four years and to come together , as one America. If we give Donald Trump four more years in office, he may irreparably damage the character of this nation and our very democracy. We cannot allow that to happen, and with Senator Kamala Harris standing as my running mate, I know that we will succeed in defeating Donald Trump and Mike Pence.The American people will choose unity over division, hope over fear, and truth over lies. Let’s remind ourselves and the rest of the world exactly who we are and who we aspire to be.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-third-anniversary-of-the-right-wing-protests-in-charlottesville-d5329a2d22ed?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------	EmptySummary					Three years ago today, the world watched in horror as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and far-right extremists with torches in hand descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Hitler's Germany in the 1930s.

MEJB14820201	Joe Biden	2020-08-14	My Statement on the 85th Anniversary of Social Security	Eighty-five years ago today, as our nation sought to heal its pain and revive its promise in the midst of a Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law. In the years since, Social Security has brought greater dignity, peace of mind, and freedom to America’s seniors and families , and, in doing so, it has reconsecrated our nation as a land of greater equity, compassion, and strength. Today, America is facing a new moment of extraordinary suffering and economic calamity. It is a moment that impels us, perhaps more than any in recent memory, to strengthen our commitment to Social Security and the promise for which it stands , to protect the most vulnerable and help every American family guard against uncertainty and loss. Instead of rising to the moment, President Trump is threatening to sever that sacred promise. Last week, from his golf course in New Jersey, he issued an executive order to “terminate” the funding Social Security relies on. Since then, he’s only doubled down , vowing in no uncertain terms to end Social Security as we know it if given another term in office. This is not a matter of campaign hyperbole or difference of opinion. It is a stone-cold fact: Trump announced his intention to permanently cut the funding source for Social Security , the payroll taxes that American workers pay into, trusting that Social Security will be there for them when they retire. When asked how he planned to make up for that funding, Trump said: “tremendous growth.” That’s the same magical fix he promised would pay for his tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans back in 2017. That “tremendous growth” never materialized, and instead his mismanagement spiraled our nation into the worst economic and jobs crisis in a century. Like his ‘tremendous health care plan,’ his ‘tremendous infrastructure plan,’ and every other promise he has thoughtlessly made and broken, this too will turn out to be worthless , and millions of seniors will be left to face the challenges of aging without the support, peace of mind, and dignity they had counted on and earned. To slash Social Security in the midst of a deadly pandemic , a crisis made exponentially worse by his own negligence , is an unconscionable betrayal of American seniors, who paid into the Social Security system throughout their lives expecting it would be there for them in their golden years. It isn’t a surprise that Donald Trump is promising to gut Social Security at a time when families need help the most , after all, he’s also in court right now trying to slash Medicare benefits for some of the most vulnerable Americans. The only surprise is how open and brazen he is about his intentions to destroy a cherished program that is ingrained in the moral bedrock of life in America. The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. To the contrary , I will strengthen it. Anything less is a failure of a president’s first and most consequential duty: the duty to care for the American people.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-the-85th-anniversary-of-social-security-911f29fd2cc6?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------	EmptySummary					Eighty-five years ago today, as our nation sought to heal its pain and revive its promise in the midst of a Great Depression, President Franklin D.

MEJB14820202	Joe Biden	2020-08-14	My Statement on Black Women’s Equal Pay Day	Black Women’s Equal Pay Day marks an unconscionable reality: it takes a Black woman nearly 20 months to earn what a white man made in one year for the same work. Over the course of their lives, it’s impossible for Black women to ever really catch up.There are workplace practices that make it impossible for a server working double shifts at $2.13/hour and living off tips to ever earn a stable living wage. There is flatout discrimination that denies her the promotion she has clearly earned and deserves. There are workplace cultures full of daily slights and biases that make others feel comfortable questioning whether she’s good enough to be hired.And, then there are four years of Donald Trump’s assault on worker rights and his massive failure over the last six months to manage the pandemic and economic freefall that has hit Black families the hardest.Today is a day to raise awareness of how far we are from the full promise of America for all Americans. But it’s also a day to remember we are less than three months away from an election where we can do something about it.In a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris Administration, Black women’s equal pay will be a top priority, not just an afterthought. We will contain the virus and get people back to work, school, and their everyday lives. We will get them the support they need to come back from the edge. And, we will build back better with an economy that advances racial equity and breaks down barriers that have left so many women, especially Black women, unseen, underpaid, and undervalued. We will champion Black women. We will move closer to equal pay , by holding employers accountable, making wage gaps more transparent, banning salary history to set future wages, and easing the ability for workers to organize and bargain collectively.We will build back better because Black women are the backbones of their families, communities, our economy, and our country. And we will ensure they earn the pay, and the dignity and respect they deserve.	https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/my-statement-on-black-womens-equal-pay-day-2f2cb3c33bf6?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------	EmptySummary					Black Women's Equal Pay Day marks an unconscionable reality: it takes a Black woman nearly 20 months to earn what a white man made in one year for the same work.

MEJB30820200	Joe Biden	2020-08-30	My Statement on the ODNI’s Decision to End Election Interference Briefings	This is not how democracy works. But it is how American national security and sovereignty are violated.The tools of our government are meant to defend the American people and our system of governance against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And yet, at a moment when we know that our elections are under threat from foreign interference , and when the President of the United States has invited interference from Russia and China , the Director of National Intelligence is failing to provide full information about the danger.For the DNI to curtail one of the most basic duties of our nonpartisan Intelligence Community , to keep the United States Congress fully informed about threats to our nation, in this case, about the real and rising threat of foreign election interference , is nothing less than a shameless partisan manipulation to protect the personal interests of President Trump. And it is a betrayal of the oath sworn to the American people and our Constitution.Nothing is more important than the security and integrity of our elections. And we know that President Trump is unwilling to take action to protect them. That leaves Congress as the best defender of our democracy. But now President Trump, through his hand-picked DNI , chosen for loyalty, not experience , is attempting to deprive Congress of the information they need to do their part.There can be only one conclusion: President Trump is hoping Vladimir Putin will once more boost his candidacy and cover his horrific failures to lead our country through the multiple crises we are facing.
