MEKH281201940	Kamala Harris	2019-01-28	Our America	Transcript of Senator Kamala Harris’ launch speech in Oakland, California.I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California. And as most of you know, I was born just up the road at Kaiser Hospital. And it was just a few miles away my parents first met as graduate students at UC Berkeley where they were active in the civil rights movement.They were born half a world apart from each other. My father, Donald, came from Jamaica to study economics. My mother, Shyamala, came from India to study the science of fighting disease.They came here in pursuit of more than just knowledge. Like so many others, they came in pursuit of a dream. And that dream was a dream for themselves, for me and for my sister Maya.As children growing up here in the East Bay, we were raised by a community with a deep belief in the promise of our country , and, a deep understanding of the parts of that promise that still remain unfulfilled.We were raised in a community where we were taught to see a world, beyond just ourselves. To be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people.We were raised to believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is everyone’s responsibility.In fact, my mother used to say “don’t sit around and complain about things, do something.” Basically I think she was saying. You’ve got to get up and stand up and don’t give up the fight!And it is this deep-rooted belief that inspired me to become a lawyer and a prosecutor.It was just a couple blocks from this very spot that nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney I walked into the courtroom for the very first time and said the five words that would guide my life’s work:“Kamala Harris, for the people.”Now, I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed.But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on people’s lives, and it’s responsibility to give them safety and dignity.I knew I wanted to protect people.And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable.And I believed then as I do now, that no one should be left to fight alone.You see, in our system of justice, we believe that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. That’s why when we file a case, it’s not filed in the name of the victim. It reads, “The People.”This is a point I have often explained to console and counsel survivors of crime, people who faced great harm. Often at the hands of someone they trust , be it a relative or a bank or a big corporation.I would remind them. You are not invisible. We all stand together.That’s the power of the people.My whole life, I’ve only had one client: the people.Fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault , a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.For the people meant fighting for a more fair criminal justice system.At a time when prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys, we created an initiative to get skills and job training instead of jail time for young people arrested for drugs.For the people meant fighting for middle-class families who had been defrauded by banks and were losing their homes by the millions in the Great Recession.And I’ll tell you, sitting across the table from the big banks, I witnessed the arrogance of power. Wealthy bankers accusing innocent homeowners of fault, as if Wall Street’s mess was of the people’s making.So we went after the five biggest banks in the United States. We won 20 billion dollars for California homeowners and together we passed the strongest anti-foreclosure law in the United States of America. We did that together.For the people meant fighting transnational gangs who traffic in drugs and guns and human beings. And I saw their sophistication, their persistence, and their ruthlessness.And folks, on the subject of transnational gangs, let’s be perfectly clear: the President’s medieval vanity project is not going to stop them.And in the fight for the people to hold this administration accountable, I have seen the amazing spirit of the American people.During the health care fight, I saw parents and children with grave illnesses walk the halls of the United States Congress, families who had traveled across the country at incredible sacrifice.They came to our nation’s capital believing that if their stories were heard, and if they were seen, their leaders would do the right thing.I saw the same thing with our Dreamers. They came by the thousands. By plane, train, and automobile. I’m sure they were sleeping ten-deep on someone’s living room floor.They came because they believe in our democracy and the only country they’ve ever known as home.I met survivors who shared their deepest, most painful personal experiences , who told stories they had never before revealed, even to their closest loved ones , because they believed that if they were seen, that their leaders would do the right thing and protect the highest court in our land.Together we took on these battles.To be sure we’ve won and we’ve lost, but we’ve never stopped fighting.And that’s why we are here today.We are here because we have another battle ahead.We are here knowing that we are at an inflection point in the history of our world.We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation.We are here because the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before.We are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question.Who are we? Who are we as Americans?So, let’s answer that question. To the world. And each other. Right here. And, right now.America, we are better than this.When we have leaders who lie and bully and attack a free press and undermine our democratic institutions, that’s not our America.When white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or massacre innocent worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, that’s not our America.When we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers, don’t you dare call it border security, that’s a human rights abuse and that’s not our America.When we have leaders who attack public schools and vilify public school teachers, that’s not our America.When bankers who crashed our economy get bonuses but workers who brought our country back can’t even get a raise that’s not our America.And when American families are barely living paycheck to paycheck, what is this administration’s response?Their response is to try to take away health care from millions of families.Their response is to give away a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country.And their response is to blame immigrants as the source of all our problems.And guys lets understand what is happening here: People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other.But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That’s not our America.Our United States of America is not about us versus them. It’s about We the people!And in this moment, we must all speak truth about what’s happening.Seek truth, speak truth and fight for the truth.So let’s speak some truth. Shall we?Let’s speak truth about our economy. Our economy today is not working for working people.The cost of living is going up, but paychecks aren’t keeping up.For so many Americans, a decent retirement feels out of reach and the American Dream feels out of touch.The truth, is our people are drowning in debt.Record student loan debt. Car loan debt. Credit card debt. Resorting to payday lenders because you can’t keep up with the bills.People are drowning in America.We have a whole generation of Americans living with the sinking fear that they won’t do as well as their parents.Let’s speak another truth about our economy. Women are paid on average 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 63 cents. Latinas, 53 cents.And here’s the thing. When we lift up the women of our country, we lift up the children of our country. We lift up the families of our country. And the whole of society benefits.Let’s speak another truth. Big pharmaceutical companies have unleashed an opioid crisis from the California coast to the mountains of West Virginia. And people once and for all we have got to call drug addiction for what it is: a national public health emergency. And we don’t need another War on Drugs.Let’s speak truth. Climate change is real and it is happening now. From wildfires In the west to hurricanes in the east, to floods and droughts in the heartland, we’re not gonna buy the lie. We’re gonna act, based on science fact, not science fiction.And let’s speak an uncomfortable but honest truth with one another: racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia are real in this country. They are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it.Let’s speak the truth that too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America. Too many black and brown Americans are locked up. From mass incarceration to cash bail to policing, our criminal justice system needs drastic repair. Let’s speak that truth.Let’s speak truth. Under this administration, America’s position in the world has never been weaker. Democratic values are under attack around the globe. When authoritarianism is on the march. When nuclear proliferation is on the rise. We have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware. Let us speak truth about these clear and present dangers.And let’s speak the biggest truth, the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. Let’s speak that truth.So, let’s not buy into that stuff that they are trying to peddle. Let’s never forget, that on the fundamental issues, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.You know, some say we need to search to find that common ground. Here’s what I say, I say we need to recognize that we are already standing on common ground.I say we will rise together or we will fall together as one nation, indivisible.And I want to be perfectly clear: I’m not talking about unity for the sake of unity. Hear me out. I’m not talking about unity for the sake of unity.I’m not talking about some façade of unity.And I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. After all let’s remember: when women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace.Let’s remember: when abolitionists spoke out and civil rights workers marched, their oppressors said they were dividing the races and violating the word of God.But Fredrick Douglass said it best and Harriet Tubman and Dr. King knew.To love the religion of Jesus is to hate the religion of the slave master.When we have true unity, no one will be subjugated for others. It’s about fighting for a country with equal treatment, collective purpose, and freedom for all.That’s who we are.And so, I stand before you today, clear-eyed about the fight ahead and what has to be done , with faith in God, with fidelity to country, and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.I’m running for president because I love my country. I love my country.I’m running to be president, of the people, by the people, and for all people.I’m running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people.For an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, where hard work is rewarded and where any worker can join a union.I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-k and debt-free college!I am running to guarantee working and middle-class families an overdue pay increase. We will deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation. Up to $500 a month to help America’s families make ends meet.And we’ll pay for it by reversing this administration’s giveaways to big corporations and the top one percent.I’m running to fight for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Which is why I will defend this nation against all threats to our cybersecurity.We will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to protect our democracy.And we will honor our service members and veterans , so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are owed when they return home on first day.I’m running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him, arrest him, chase him, or kill him, because of his race.An America where every parent can send their children to school without being haunted by the horror of another killing spree.Where we treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women’s rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself.An America where we welcome refugees and bring people out of the shadows, and provide a pathway to citizenship.An America where our daughters, where our sisters, where our mothers and grandmothers are respected where they live and where they work.Where reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States but guaranteed in every state.I’ll fight for an America where we keep our word and where we honor our promises. Because that’s our America. That’s the America I believe in. That’s the America I know we believe in.And as we embark on this campaign, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth.And of course, we know this is not going to be easy guys. It’s not going to be easy.We know what the doubters will say.It’s the same thing they’ve always said.They’ll say it’s not your time. They’ll say wait your turn. They’ll say the odds are long. They’ll say it can’t be done.But America’s story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been. That is our story. That is our story.As Robert Kennedy many years ago said, “Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.”He also said, “I do not lightly dismiss the dangers and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent President, but these are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary election.” He said, “At stake is not simply the leadership of our party and even our country. It is our right to moral leadership of this planet.”So today I say to you my friends, these are not ordinary times. And this will not be an ordinary election. But this is our America.And here’s the thing. It’s up to us.It’s up to us. Each and every one of us.So let’s remember in this fight we have the power of the people.We can achieve the dreams of our parents and grandparents.We can heal our nation.We can give our children the future they deserve.We can reclaim the American Dream for every single person in our country.We can restore America’s moral leadership on this planet.So let’s do this.And let’s do it together.And let’s start now.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/our-america-4642b443d529?source=user_profile---------49----------------------------	EmptySummary					I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland, California.

Let us speak truth about these clear and present dangers.And let's speak the biggest truth, the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. Let's speak that truth.So, let's not buy into that stuff that they are trying to peddle. Let's never forget, that on the fundamental issues, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.You know, some say we need to search to find that common ground. Here's what I say, I say we need to recognize that we are already standing on common ground.I say we will rise together or we will fall together as one nation, indivisible.And I want to be perfectly clear: I'm not talking about unity for the sake of unity. Hear me out. I'm not talking about unity for the sake of unity.I'm not talking about some fa�ade of unity.And I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. After all let's remember: when women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace.Let's remember: when abolitionists spoke out and civil rights workers marched, their oppressors said they were dividing the races and violating the word of God.But Fredrick Douglass said it best and Harriet Tubman and Dr. King knew.To love the religion of Jesus is to hate the religion of the slave master.When we have true unity, no one will be subjugated for others. It's about fighting for a country with equal treatment, collective purpose, and freedom for all.That's who we are.And so, I stand before you today, clear-eyed about the fight ahead and what has to be done , with faith in God, with fidelity to country, and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother. I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.I'm running for president because I love my country. I love my country.I'm running to be president, of the people, by the people, and for all people.I'm running to fight for an America where the economy works for working people.For an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills, where hard work is rewarded and where any worker can join a union.I am running to declare, once and for all, that health care is a fundamental right, and we will deliver that right with Medicare for All!I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-k and debt-free college!I am running to guarantee working and middle-class families an overdue pay increase. We will deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation. Up to $500 a month to help America's families make ends meet.And we'll pay for it by reversing this administration's giveaways to big corporations and the top one percent.I'm running to fight for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Which is why I will defend this nation against all threats to our cybersecurity.We will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to protect our democracy.And we will honor our service members and veterans , so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are owed when they return home on first day.I'm running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him, arrest him, chase him, or kill him, because of his race.An America where every parent can send their children to school without being haunted by the horror of another killing spree.Where we treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women's rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself.An America where we welcome refugees and bring people out of the shadows, and provide a pathway to citizenship.An America where our daughters, where our sisters, where our mothers and grandmothers are respected where they live and where they work.Where reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States but guaranteed in every state.I'll fight for an America where we keep our word and where we honor our promises. Because that's our America. That's the America I believe in. That's the America I know we believe in.And as we embark on this campaign, I will tell you this: I am not perfect. Lord knows, I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. And I will speak the truth.And of course, we know this is not going to be easy guys. It's not going to be easy.We know what the doubters will say.It's the same thing they've always said.They'll say it's not your time. They'll say wait your turn. They'll say the odds are long. They'll say it can't be done.But America's story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been. That is our story. That is our story.As Robert Kennedy many years ago said, 'Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.'He also said, 'I do not lightly dismiss the dangers and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent President, but these are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary election.' He said, 'At stake is not simply the leadership of our party and even our country. It is our right to moral leadership of this planet.'So today I say to you my friends, these are not ordinary times. And this will not be an ordinary election. But this is our America.And here's the thing. It's up to us.It's up to us. Each and every one of us.So let's remember in this fight we have the power of the people.We can achieve the dreams of our parents and grandparents.We can heal our nation.We can give our children the future they deserve.We can reclaim the American Dream for every single person in our country.We can restore America's moral leadership on this planet.So let's do this.And let's do it together.And let's start now.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

They have refused to act on climate change. So it’s on us to speak the truth, rooted in science fact, not science fiction.Here’s the truth: climate change is real, and it is an existential threat to our country, our planet, and our future. With each passing day, the imminent threat of climate change grows , and we see it in everything from more instances of extreme weather to rapidly melting glaciers.According to a harrowing report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have a shrinking window to take drastic action to cut carbon emissions and make meaningful change to save our planet.The Green New Deal is a bold plan to drastically shift our country to 100% clean and renewable energy. We will repair our country’s crumbling infrastructure, upgrade buildings across the nation, and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions.We don’t have much time to make the urgent changes we need to protect ourselves and our planet.

Church in Charleston to pay our respects to the nine victims of the 2015 shooting and leave some flowers in their memory.Then, we headed to Rodney Scott’s BBQ where we ate our fill. The food was amazing, and the people who prepared it were so passionate about both barbecue and the community they serve.I met a woman named Janet there who told me she’s already contributed to our campaign , thank you, Janet! (As you already know, we’re not taking a dime from corporate PACs or lobbyists , this campaign is powered by the people, just like you. If you want to join Janet with a grassroots contribution, just click here.)We closed out our day in Charleston with a town hall where we discussed the tough issues facing our country today: health care, how to get more good jobs, mass incarceration, and more. It was a full house! Great to meet so many folks from South Carolina for the very first time and hear what’s on their minds.We started our Saturday in Columbia visiting local women-owned businesses , these women are incredible entrepreneurs and community leaders. I couldn’t leave without buying this rainbow jacket!At one of the boutiques, I met a young South Carolinian who founded her own anti-bully organization called WEFE , With Everyone For Everyone. I took the WEFE pledge: kindness, respect, and lifting up others. We all could learn something from the WEFE Warriors these days.Then, we headed to our Columbia town hall, where we talked about lifting up the middle class and ensuring all families have the same opportunities to get ahead; why I support the Green New Deal; and more.Thank you for everything, South Carolina.

I look forward to being back in the Hawkeye State soon!We started our weekend trip to Iowa meeting with the Asian and Latino Coalition and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).We had a round-table discussion about the really important issues of our day , like hurricane relief and providing better support to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico; enacting equitable tax laws that lift up middle-class Americans instead of lining the pockets of the top 1%; how we can fight for Medicare for All , and win; and the pressing, critical issue of immigration reform.Then, we headed to a town hall in Ankeny, where more than 700 Iowans joined us to hear more about our campaign for the people.At our Ankeny town hall, we talked about tackling the national debt so future generations aren’t saddled with this crisis; how we will pass Medicare for All and guarantee health care for all Americans; combating climate change and safeguarding our planet for future generations; and how we can prioritize processing what could be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits across our country to ensure justice for survivors.And I had the chance to see my friend Nora again! Last December, she wrote me a very persuasive letter encouraging me to run for president. I was so excited to see Nora again in a fabulous shirt that said “Future President.” I can’t wait to donate to her campaign!From there, we took part in an Iowa tradition: the Story County Dems Soup Supper, where hundreds of fired-up Democrats gather to hear directly from candidates running for President.We then visited with Iowans at a Black Caucus event, where we spoke truth about the issues that affect the Black Americans in this country , from the gun violence epidemic, to maternal mortality rates, to climate change, to mass incarceration, to giving middle-class families a much-needed lift up, and more.Sunday morning, we headed out bright and early and were able to surprise a training event hosted by The Arena, an organization doing the critical work of training and supporting the next generation of candidates and campaign staff.We closed out our Sunday with more than 700 supporters at a town hall in Scott County, where we discussed the core issues of our campaign , and how Democrats need a fighter in this election who’s able to prosecute the case against this president.I am so grateful to everyone who took time out of their weekends to join us on the campaign trail in Iowa.

MEKH117201931	Kamala Harris	2019-07-11	Kamala Harris Announces Plan to Close Nationwide Rape Kit Backlog In First Term	As Jeffrey Epstein Case Draws Further Scrutiny and Attention, Harris Commits to Fighting for Survivors of Sex Abuse As Presiden.As California Attorney General, Harris Closed Rape Kit Backlog In First Year In Offic,Senator Kamala Harris is announcing a plan to close the nationwide rape kit backlog by the end of her first term, a bold commitment to help ensure justice for survivors of sexual assault, sex abuse, and rape. The announcement comes as the case of Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted this week for sex trafficking and faces accusations of raping teenage girls, draws further scrutiny. On Tuesday, Harris called for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who as U.S. Attorney negotiated a sweetheart deal for Epstein, to resign. “We need leaders committed to fighting for justice for survivors of abuse, not protecting predators,” she said.Harris’ proposal would invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again. On average, it costs $1,000 to $1,500 to test one rape kit. The annual estimated cost of the program is $100 million, which is $2 million less than what taxpayers have reportedly spent on President Trump’s golf trips. Rape kits are used by medical professionals to collect evidence during a medical exam of a sexual assault victim in order to establish elements of a crime, and in the last decade, roughly 225,000 known untested rape kits have been uncovered.“The federal government can and should prioritize justice for survivors of sex abuse, assault, and rape,” Harris said. “As California’s Attorney General, I committed resources and attention to clearing a backlog of 1,300 untested rape kits at state-run labs, and we got it done within my first year in office. We need the same focus at the national level to pursue justice and help hold predators accountable.”As Attorney General, Harris eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed. Harris’ program earned her office the U.S. Department of Justice’s Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services and was considered as “a model for use statewide.” She also backed California legislation in 2016 “to illuminate the state’s invisible backlog of untested rape kits,” and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.To receive additional funding under her plan, states will be required to implement four reforms: (1) Annually counting and reporting the number of untested rape kits; (2) Requiring the submission and testing of all newly collected rape kits within a short time frame; (3) Tracking rape kits and giving victims the right to know the status of their rape kits; and, (4) Increasing the availability of rape kits statewide, including in rural and remote areas. States will have the option to partner with the FBI to eliminate their backlog or to receive federal funding to process kits on their own. States will also be encouraged to enact laws that require law enforcement agencies to preserve rape kits for the duration of the statute of limitations.Justice for women has emerged as a central theme in Harris’ campaign so far. She has already proposed plans to stop unconstitutional state-level abortion bans before they are implemented, force corporations to pay women equally, and close the “boyfriend loophole” to prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns, among other proposals to combat Black maternal mortality and increase pay for the predominately female teaching profession.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/kamala-harris-announces-plan-to-close-nationwide-rape-kit-backlog-in-first-term-3d156402d323?source=user_profile---------33----------------------------	EmptySummary					As Jeffrey Epstein Case Draws Further Scrutiny and Attention, Harris Commits to Fighting for Survivors of Sex Abuse As Presiden.As California Attorney General, Harris Closed Rape Kit Backlog In First Year In Offic,Senator Kamala Harris is announcing a plan to close the nationwide rape kit backlog by the end of her first term, a bold commitment to help ensure justice for survivors of sexual assault, sex abuse, and rape.

We need the same focus at the national level to pursue justice and help hold predators accountable.'As Attorney General, Harris eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed. Harris' program earned her office the U.S. Department of Justice's Award for Professional Innovation in Victim Services and was considered as 'a model for use statewide.' She also backed California legislation in 2016 'to illuminate the state's invisible backlog of untested rape kits,' and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors' Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.To receive additional funding under her plan, states will be required to implement four reforms: (1) Annually counting and reporting the number of untested rape kits; (2) Requiring the submission and testing of all newly collected rape kits within a short time frame; (3) Tracking rape kits and giving victims the right to know the status of their rape kits; and, (4) Increasing the availability of rape kits statewide, including in rural and remote areas. States will have the option to partner with the FBI to eliminate their backlog or to receive federal funding to process kits on their own. States will also be encouraged to enact laws that require law enforcement agencies to preserve rape kits for the duration of the statute of limitations.Justice for women has emerged as a central theme in Harris' campaign so far. She has already proposed plans to stop unconstitutional state-level abortion bans before they are implemented, force corporations to pay women equally, and close the 'boyfriend loophole' to prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence from purchasing guns, among other proposals to combat Black maternal mortality and increase pay for the predominately female teaching profession.
MEKH267201929	Kamala Harris	2019-07-26	Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act	In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, establishing that every American deserves to live in a fully inclusive and accessible society. Yet, 29 years later, we still have a lot of work to do to live up to the full promise of the ADA.Ensuring that every American is paid a living wage is one example of where we must do more. People with disabilities have the right to work a job that pays the minimum wage or higher , absolutely nothing less. However, in many states, there are still subminimum wage laws that allow employers to pay Americans with disabilities less than the minimum wage. That’s not right. And when it comes to education, we must do more to ensure that children with disabilities are learning in adequately funded classrooms with the assistance they need so that they have equal access to the educational opportunities they deserve. Access to quality health care and community supports and services should be a fundamental human right for every single American and yet Republicans continue to try to roll back all the advances the Affordable Care Act made to expand coverage for people with disabilities.I believe in an America that is fully inclusive and accessible for everyone and when I’m president, I will fight every day to make that a reality. For example, I believe we need to adequately fund our classrooms, to expand access to integrated employment opportunities, to eliminate subminimum wages, to ensure our emergency preparedness and disaster programs and services are fully inclusive and accessible as our climate changes, and to build a diverse federal workforce that includes people with disabilities. And, I believe we need to recommit to fully enforcing the ADA, IDEA, and Rehabilitation Act. As the former Attorney General of California, I know the impact that strong enforcement of civil rights laws can have on the lives of Americans. That’s why I will appoint an Attorney General who prioritizes enforcement of the ADA, and all disability civil rights laws, and will double the size of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to ensure we have the resources to back up that commitment.And on the anniversary of this important civil rights milestone, I am proud to announce my campaign’s Americans with Disabilities Leadership Council. The council will work closely with my team and me throughout this campaign to take on the issues that are most important to Americans with disabilities.I’d like to invite everyone to join me as we take on these important challenges to make full inclusion and accessibility a reality.When we ensure that every American with disabilities is able to fully participate in our communities, in our schools, in our workplaces, and at the ballot box, our country is stronger.

MEKH297201928	Kamala Harris	2019-07-29	My Plan For Medicare For All	One of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second sound bites or slogans to answer complex questions. There is perhaps no more complicated or more personal issue for Americans than health care. I know this from my own personal life, caring for my mother as she battled colon cancer. And I also know it from talking to so many Americans in this campaign , seniors and union members, young people and parents, workers and caregivers. No panicked parent should hold a sick child while worrying about an expensive hospital bill. No senior should have to cut their pill in half just to make ends meet.Right now, the American health care system is a patchwork of plans, providers and costs that have left people frustrated, powerless and insurance companies in charge. And the bottom line is that health care just costs too much. So as a presidential candidate, here is where I stand to make transformative change for the better.Insurance companies and drug companies have jacked up prices so much that Americans, on average, pay twice what people in other countries pay for health care. Even though we spend more, we have failed to insure nearly 30 million Americans, and the problem has gotten worse under Donald Trump.Millions have lost their health insurance under his presidency, and 21 million risk losing coverage as this administration and their Republican allies try to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the courts. Between 2014 and 2017, 15,000 people died because Republican states decided not to expand Medicaid.The first thing the next Democratic president must do is end these senseless attacks on Obamacare. As someone who fought tooth and nail as Attorney General and as Senator to prevent repeal, that’s exactly what I will continue to do.But we are also at a crisis point for health care in America. Big corporations are still putting profits over people’s wellbeing, and Republicans are determined to destroy what progress we have made and put those same corporations back in charge of the system. The next Democratic president needs a clear, transformative, and achievable vision of how we finally change this broken system for good.I look at this issue through a fairly simple prism: each night, millions of Americans wake up at 3 o’clock in the morning worried about some aspect of their health care. How am I going to afford a $5,000 deductible just for walking my child into the emergency room because their fever won’t go down? How will I pay that surprise medical bill because the ambulance that took me to the hospital was out-of-network? How am I going to continue to see my doctor when I get a new job and my new insurance plan doesn’t have them in their network?Imagine changing a job and not having to worry about your health care coverage. Imagine going to the pharmacy and not having to worry about an outrageous price increase on the prescription drug you need. Imagine walking through those sliding glass doors at the emergency room or doctor’s office or hospital knowing that the first card you pull out will be a Medicare card, not a credit card.We need comprehensive health insurance that covers every American.Medicare works. It’s popular. Seniors transition into it every day, and people keep their doctors and get care at a lower cost. Let’s not lose sight that we have a Medicare system that’s already working.Now, let’s expand it to all Americans and give everyone access to comprehensive health care. Medicare for All will cover all medically necessary services, including emergency room visits, doctor visits, vision, dental, hearing aids, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, and comprehensive reproductive health care services. It will also allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices.Under my Medicare for All plan, we will also expand the program to include other benefits Americans desperately need that will save money in the long run such as an expanded mental health program including telehealth and easier access to early diagnosis and treatment, and innovative patient programs to help people identify the right doctor and understand how to navigate the health system.And I’ll institute a serious audit of prescription drug costs to ensure pharmaceutical companies are not charging more than other comparable countries, a comprehensive maternal child health program to dramatically reduce deaths among women and infants of color, and meaningful rural health care reforms, such as increasing residency slots for rural areas with workforce shortages and loan forgiveness for rural health care professionals, to promote high-quality access for people regardless of their zip code.But I am clear-eyed about the challenge of achieving this goal. It will not be easy, and it will not happen overnight. So here is my plan to get us there.First, when we pass my plan, all Americans will immediately have the ability to buy into Medicare. This is similar to the immediate, introductory buy-in provided in Senator Sanders’ Medicare for All bill. Right away, it will lower costs and give us a baseline plan as we transition to Medicare for All.Second, we will set up an expanded Medicare system, with a 10-year phase-in period. During this transition, we will automatically enroll newborns and the uninsured into this new and improved Medicare system, give all doctors time to get into the system, and provide a commonsense path for employers, employees, the underinsured, and others on federally-designated programs, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, to transition. This will expand the number of insured Americans and create a new viable public system that guarantees universal coverage at a lower cost. Expanding the transition window will also lower the overall cost of the program.Third, in setting up this plan, we will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits. This would function similar to how private Medicare plans work today, which cover about a third of Medicare seniors, and operate within the Medicare system. Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around. This preserves the options that seniors have today and expands options to all Americans, while also telling insurance companies they don’t run the show.Unlike the current system, private plans in the new Medicare system will be held to stricter consumer protection standards than they are today, such as getting reimbursed less than what the Medicare plan will cost to operate, to ensure that they are delivering meaningful value and unable to profit off of gaming consumers or the government. People will also be able to purchase supplemental insurance covering services not included in Medicare, such as medical insurance for traveling abroad, or cosmetic surgery.Essentially, we would allow private insurance to offer a plan in the Medicare system, but they will be subject to strict requirements to ensure it lowers costs and expands services. If they want to play by our rules, they can be in the system. If not, they have to get out.Throughout this entire period, I would also ensure the new system of Medicare for All meets clear benchmarks before asking people to join the plan. Has the public Medicare plan fulfilled its promise of high-quality coverage without unaffordable cost-sharing? Have we meaningfully expanded coverage to the uninsured? Have we reduced costs for middle-class Americans and working people?Data matters and should inform our transition. Health care is personal to people and we should make sure we get it right.These benchmarks are also key as we fight back against the lies pushed by Big Pharma and their allies that this plan would “end Medicare as we know it,” or other misleading attacks. Seniors will be able to keep their Medicare and have dental, vision, and hearing aids covered immediately. Medicare Advantage plans would continue uninterrupted by the transition. Under my plan, no one will lose access to insurance during a transition. Period.At the end of the ten-year transition, every American will be a part of this new Medicare system. They will get insurance either through the new public Medicare plan or a Medicare plan offered by a private insurer within that system. Seniors will see stronger Medicare benefits than they have now. We will cover millions more people who don’t have health insurance today. And we will reduce costs, save our country money, and ensure that no American has to sacrifice getting the care they need just because the cost is a barrier.Right now, the U.S. spends $3.5 trillion a year on health care. If we do nothing over the next decade, that number will skyrocket to an estimated $6 trillion a year. So the real question is: how can we afford not to act?By extending the phase-in period to ten years, we will decrease the overall cost of the program compared to the Sanders proposal, and we can save additional money by accelerating delivery system reforms and value-based care that rewards meaningful outcomes. More than 200 economists have said we will dramatically save money over the long run if we expand the Medicare program to include everyone and limit profits for drug companies and insurance companies.Senator Sanders, for example, has put forward a number of ways to help pay for his Medicare for All plan, including an income-based premium paid by employers, higher taxes on the top 1%, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income, among others. I think these are good options, especially making the top 1% and corporations pay their fair share through a more progressive income, payroll, and estate tax.However, one of Senator Sanders’ options is to tax households making above $29,000 an additional 4% income-based premium. I believe this hits the middle class too hard.To pay for this specific change, I would tax Wall Street stock trades at 0.2%, bond trades at 0.1%, and derivative transactions at 0.002%. Think of it like this: that’s a $2 fee on a $1,000 trade by investors and big banks. I would also end foreign tax shelters by taxing offshore corporate income at the same rate as domestic corporate income. Together, these proposals would raise well over $2 trillion over ten years, more than enough to make up the difference from raising the middle-class income threshold.In total, this plan will reduce our country’s health care costs and lower Americans’ out-of-pocket costs, all while extending health insurance coverage to every American.So that’s my plan: stop the attacks on Americans’ health care coming from this administration and their Republican and special interest allies, expand on the progress made under Obamacare, immediately offer an improved Medicare buy-in to all Americans, put in place an expanded Medicare system that everyone is in, expand coverage, reduce costs, increase options for care, and establish a reasonable phase-in period with clear benchmarks to ensure a smooth transition to Medicare for All.And what will the result be? Health insurance for every American. Expansive coverage for nearly all medical benefits. Continuity of care. Lower health care costs for American consumers and our country overall. Improved health, well-being, and productivity for the American people.Learn more about my plan at kamalaharris.org/medicare-for-all.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/my-plan-for-medicare-for-all-7730370dd421?source=user_profile---------30----------------------------	EmptySummary					One of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second sound bites or slogans to answer complex questions.

MEKH298201926	Kamala Harris	2019-08-29	Kamala’s Commitment to Full Inclusion and Civil Rights for People with Disabilities	Recommitting to building inclusive economic opportunity in Americ.According to CDC data, about a quarter of people in the United States have a disability. Kamala believes in an America that is fully accessible and inclusive for everyone and her administration will fight to make this a reality across all parts of our society. As president, Kamala will have diverse leaders with disabilities developing all the policies her administration champions, including priorities that will lift up people with disabilities.To do this we must expand economic opportunity and security for people with disabilities. In 2018, the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was more than twice that for workers without disabilities. Only 32 percent of people with disabilities who are working-age are employed. On the other hand, 73 percent of people without disabilities in the same age group are employed. Just as we fight to finally eliminate practices that lead to people with disabilities being paid subminimum wages, we also have to speak the truth about how we need to eliminate barriers that make it harder for people with disabilities to fully participate in our workforce.Under Kamala’s leadership, in partnership with the disability community, we can build an America that lives up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Our country is stronger when everyone is valued, everyone has dignity, and everyone can be part of the competitive labor force.She’ll pass the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act, which will establish a grant program for states to help redesign business models and strategies to increase employment of people with disabilities in competitive integrated employment.People with disabilities are both more likely to work in low wage fields as well as be paid less than the minimum wage. That’s why she’ll pass the Raise the Wage Act, which will not only raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour but will also phase out the “subminimum” wage.Kamala will make changes to the vocational rehabilitation system at the Department of Education, which gives grants to states to help people with disabilities prepare for, secure, and retain employment. Kamala will make sure that the grant program covers a wider range of services and supports for a greater number of people to help more people with disabilities get the workplace accommodations, adaptive technology and devices, and other things that can be barriers to finding and maintaining a job.And she’ll fight to increase funding for the program so that it can serve everyone who would benefit from assistance under it.Federal civil rights laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act already require that our transportation systems and housing projects be fully accessible. However, these accommodations still have accessibility issues because efforts to make the projects fully accessible are frequently not done at the front-end of the project.For example, more than a quarter of rail stations across the country are not fully accessible to people with disabilities. The same is true of 12% of the U.S. rail fleet.Kamala will address this by taking executive action to direct the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to require that funding recipients submit plans detailing how their projects will be fully accessible prior to receiving funding.And she’ll direct her education secretary to increase enforcement of civil rights laws designed to protect that right to an education.And she’ll work to increase resources to better prepare teachers to meet the needs of students with disabilities in inclusive classrooms and expand access to post-secondary education for people with disabilities.She’ll fight to finally ratify U.S. participation in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to affirm American leadership in fighting for the civil rights of people with disabilities around the world.She’ll fight to pass the Working Families Tax Credit to allow people without dependent children to take advantage of the Earned Income Tax Credit. And she’ll make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable which would be particularly beneficial to families who have children with disabilities.Kamala’s plan fully covers comprehensive long-term services and supports, as well as assistive technologies and Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) services that are critical to children with disabilities. It also ensures that those long-term services and supports are consumer-directed and are provided in home- and community-based settings.And it ensures that when families move, or people with disabilities change jobs, their coverage moves with them so that they have uninterrupted access to the care and services they need.She’ll ensure that people with disabilities impacted by disasters have the services and other civil rights protections they are entitled to under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, so they can return home, to work and school at the same time as the rest of the disaster impacted community.Kamala will recommit us to the goal President Obama established in 2010 to make the federal government a model inclusive employer and strongly enforce Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. She will direct agencies to create updated plans for how to make the recruitment, hiring, and retention of people with disabilities a priority in her administration. And she’ll make sure this diverse leadership is represented in senior positions and that there are opportunities for promotion.Kamala will also take executive action to ensure that the technology the federal government buys, develops, or uses is fully accessible, as is currently required by federal law. This will include requiring each agency to implement a plan to ensure that any new technology developed or acquired is fully accessible before it is deployed, as well as doing an analysis of existing technology that is not compliant and develop a timeline for updating it.And Kamala will create new senior-level positions in the White House to make sure that the priorities for people with disabilities are incorporated across all of her policymaking, particularly on the Domestic Policy Council and the economic work of her administration.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/kamalas-commitment-to-full-inclusion-and-civil-rights-for-people-with-disabilities-7cfd8adb512?source=user_profile---------28----------------------------	EmptySummary					Recommitting to building inclusive economic opportunity in Americ.According to CDC data, about a quarter of people in the United States have a disability. Kamala believes in an America that is fully accessible and inclusive for everyone and her administration will fight to make this a reality across all parts of our society. As president, Kamala will have diverse leaders with disabilities developing all the policies her administration champions, including priorities that will lift up people with disabilities.To do this we must expand economic opportunity and security for people with disabilities. In 2018, the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was more than twice that for workers without disabilities. Only 32 percent of people with disabilities who are working-age are employed. On the other hand, 73 percent of people without disabilities in the same age group are employed. Just as we fight to finally eliminate practices that lead to people with disabilities being paid subminimum wages, we also have to speak the truth about how we need to eliminate barriers that make it harder for people with disabilities to fully participate in our workforce.Under Kamala's leadership, in partnership with the disability community, we can build an America that lives up to the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Our country is stronger when everyone is valued, everyone has dignity, and everyone can be part of the competitive labor force.She'll pass the Transformation to Competitive Employment Act, which will establish a grant program for states to help redesign business models and strategies to increase employment of people with disabilities in competitive integrated employment.People with disabilities are both more likely to work in low wage fields as well as be paid less than the minimum wage. That's why she'll pass the Raise the Wage Act, which will not only raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour but will also phase out the 'subminimum' wage.Kamala will make changes to the vocational rehabilitation system at the Department of Education, which gives grants to states to help people with disabilities prepare for, secure, and retain employment. Kamala will make sure that the grant program covers a wider range of services and supports for a greater number of people to help more people with disabilities get the workplace accommodations, adaptive technology and devices, and other things that can be barriers to finding and maintaining a job.And she'll fight to increase funding for the program so that it can serve everyone who would benefit from assistance under it.Federal civil rights laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act already require that our transportation systems and housing projects be fully accessible.

MEKH99201924	Kamala Harris	2019-09-09	Kamala’s Plan to Transform the Criminal Justice System and Re-Envision Public Safety in America	Click here for a PDF version of the pla.Reforming our criminal justice system is as complex and pressing an endeavor as any other in our lifetime. It is the civil rights issue of our time, and there is perhaps no one more uniquely suited to taking on this issue than Kamala Harris.From the civil rights protests she attended as a child, to her time working inside the system as a prosecutor, Kamala has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system. And because of her experiences, she has the insight and the fight to fundamentally transform the system for the better.At its best, the system serves to hold serious wrongdoers accountable and achieve justice for crime survivors, while helping to build safer and healthier communities. At its worst, decades of failed policies have created an unjust, unequal, and vastly expansive system that disproportionately harms communities of color and criminalizes individuals just because they are poor. It is long past time to re-envision public safety by strengthening and supporting our communities and drastically limiting the number of people we expose to our criminal justice system. As president, Kamala will fundamentally transform how we approach public safety.The criminal justice system in America is vast. There are about 2.3 million people in the nation’s prisons and jails today. Of the 2.3 million people, nearly 2 million are in state prisons and local jails. Thus, it is important to understand that much of criminal justice policy occurs on the state and local level. However, the president also has an important role to play in effecting change.As president, there are four main levers that Kamala can exercise to change criminal justice policy. She can: (1) work with Congress and use her executive authority to change law and policy on the federal level; (2) investigate state and local actors through the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division; (3) empower and incentivize behavior on the state and local level through federal funding; and (4) use her voice as president to advocate for change. And as president, Kamala will exercise every one of these levers to increase public safety, reduce our outsized criminal justice system, and make it fairer and more equitable for all.Guiding Principles:(1) End Mass Incarceration and Invest Resources into Evidence and Community-Based Programs that Reduce Crime and Help Build Safe and Healthy Communitie,(2) Law Enforcement’s Primary Mission is to Serve and Protect Communities. It Should Instill Trust and Be Accountable to the Communities It Serve,(3) The System Must Treat Individuals Equitably and Humanel,(4) The System Must Protect Vulnerable Peopl,There are about 2.3 million people in the nation’s prisons and jails today, which is an increase from about 500,000 in 1980. But perhaps more importantly, people go to jail 10.6 million times every year. The number of jail admissions is perhaps a more accurate reflection of just how expansive the system is, and how much work is required to transform and contract the system. Worse, Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of White Americans; the incarceration rate for Black women is twice that of White women. And when these men and women are released from confinement, one report found that they face nearly 50,000 federal, state, and local legal restrictions that serve as barriers to reentry into society. For example, one study shows that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50%, and the negative impact is even more considerable for Black applicants.End the “War on Drugs” , One-fifth of the incarcerated population , or 456,000 people , is serving time for a drug charge while another 1.15 million are on probation and parole for drug-related offenses. This is especially the case on the federal level, where nearly half of the prison population are there for drug crimes. So it is past time to end the failed war on drugs, and it begins with legalizing marijuana. Marijuana arrests account for over 50% of all drug arrests. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple marijuana possession. Worse, despite roughly equal usage rates, Black people are about four times more likely than White people to be arrested for marijuana. Black Americans also make up nearly 30% of all drug-related arrests, despite accounting for only 12.5% of substance users.Legalizing marijuana. Support states in legalizing marijuana; legalize marijuana on the federal level, expunge convictions, and reinvest in the community.Kamala’s Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act does the following: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy; Requires expungement and, on motion, re-sentencing for marijuana-based convictions; Creates 3 grant programs by assessing a sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products. The grant programs do the following:(1) Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid;(2) Provides states and localities with funds to make loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals;(3) Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Invest money in states to significantly reduce the incarceration of women convicted of non-violent offenses. While most are aware of the system’s impact on men, it is less well known how quickly the incarcerated population for women has gone up. According to the Sentencing Project, “the female incarcerated population stands nearly eight times higher than in 1980.” We must therefore focus on dramatically reducing the number of incarcerated women convicted of non-violent offenses by finding alternatives to incarceration.Sentencing Reforms. Significant reforms must be made with respect to the criminal justice system’s sentencing schemes, including:End mandatory minimums on federal level and incentivize states to do the same. As a Senator, Kamala is a cosponsor of the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would eliminate all mandatory minimums by letting judges issue sentences below the mandatory minimum.Reform clemency process to form clemency/sentencing review units and significantly increase use of clemency.The clemency process needs to be removed from the Department of Justice where there are inherent conflicts of interest. Specifically, DOJ should not determine whether individuals convicted by their own colleagues should be shortened or commuted.For those who have been sentenced to long prison terms (i.e., 20 years or more), the sentencing review unit would provide for an assessment as to whether it is appropriate and serves the interests of justice for the incarcerated individual to be released or have their sentence shortened after having served 10 years.Reform community supervision.Invest money in states to shorten the length of probation and other forms of community supervision where appropriate and where it serves the interests of justice;Invest money in states to end jail time for technical violations of community- based supervision (reforming parole).End the use of private prisons. Less than 10 percent of our prison population is held in private facilities, but it is nevertheless still necessary to end the profit motive that drives these private prisons, as it is inhumane to profit off of imprisonment and allow a system that continues to create incentives that are contrary to the goal of helping people rehabilitate themselves and return to the community. Kamala also believe we must end private detention centers for undocumented immigrants.Several studies have demonstrated that children’s earliest life experiences , from nourishment and reading to poverty and exposure to violence , have profound effects on their brain development and long-term health and safety. Even later in childhood, the brain maturity of our young people is fundamentally different from adults. As a result, children must be treated differently by our government, from the child welfare and education systems to our criminal justice system. We must invest in the building blocks of public safety by prioritizing the health, well-being, and safety of children from their earliest years to set them up to thrive as adults.Create a Bureau of Children and Family Justice.As the Attorney General of California, Kamala created the Bureau of Children’s Justice to focus on children’s civil rights in the child welfare, education, and juvenile justice systems.As president, Kamala would build and expand on that idea by creating a Bureau of Children and Family Justice to work across agencies in supporting communities and families, including investing in healthcare, education, jobs, and other wrap around services.As president, Kamala would address the broken foster care system and disrupt the pipeline of children from the child welfare system to the criminal justice system. She’ll work with leaders like Rep. Karen Bass and the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth (CCFY) to ensure foster youth have the education, healthcare, and other wraparound services they need to heal from trauma and grow into healthy, thriving adults.Research shows that access to school-based health services has a positive impact on absences, dropout rates, disciplinary problems and other academic outcomes, in addition to the crucial health-related benefits these services provide. As president, Kamala will ensure that students continue to have access to school-based health services by requiring equivalent or better services to be covered and reimbursable under her Medicare for All plan.Invest money in states/localities to end juvenile incarceration in favor of restorative justice programs and wrap-around services, except for the most serious crimes.End life sentences of children and offer opportunities for sentence reduction to young people convicted of crimes. For example, fight to end de facto life without parole sentences by allowing youth sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed before their 18th birthday to petition the original sentencing court for review of their sentence after they have served 10 years.End the transfer of children to adult prisons;End solitary confinement for children;Invest money in states to stop criminal charges for school-based disciplinary behavior;Invest money in states to hold schools accountable for discriminatory practices in suspensions and expulsions. As CA AG, Kamala launched an investigation into the Stockton Unified School District police department over concerns of racial discrimination in school discipline and school policing, including treatment of elementary school children. CA DOJ announced a comprehensive settlement in 2019 to resolve systemic civil rights violations of African American and Latinx students and students with disabilities.Make significant federal investment for innovative Back-on-Track programs that provide in-custody and out-of-custody education and comprehensive services to individuals convicted of crimes to reduce recidivism by equipping them with the tools they need to reenter society successfully.Education, job training, and treatment. Mandate that federal prisons provide educational and vocational training, and mental health and addiction treatment in custody, including diagnosis and treatment of trauma. Early in her career, Kamala worked with Dr. Nadine Burke Harris , now California’s Surgeon General , to create the Center for Youth Wellness to screen children for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and treat the toxic stress that can have lasting effects on their physical and mental health. As president, she’ll invest federal money to incentivize states to follow their lead.Reentry educational course. Mandate federal prisons to provide a reentry educational course that provides, among other things, information on acquiring identification and their options with respect to housing, education, treatment, and other assistance programs. Invest federal money into this program and incentivize states to provide the same reentry educational course.Create an advisory board of directly impacted individuals to make recommendations for successful re-entry.Expungement & Sealing, Automatic expungement and sealing of offenses that are not serious or violent after 5 year,Ban the box, i.e., remove questions about an individual’s conviction histories until after conditional offers have been made. Individuals reentering society should have a meaningful opportunity to obtain a job and reintegrate into the community.Restore voting rights for all who have served their sentence.End federal bans on formerly-incarcerated individuals (as well as those arrested and not incarcerated) access to public housing, student loans, SNAP, and professional work licenses, including: Fair Chance at Housing Act of 2019: Kamala’s bicameral bill introduced with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which helps remove barriers to obtaining federal housing assistance for individuals with criminal records.Prioritize enforcement of anti-discrimination laws/EEOC rules that prevent discrimination in employment, housing, etc. based on a prior convictions.Law enforcement is a critical part of our communities and we should appreciate the sacrifices of those who serve on our behalf. And we should also recognize that the majority of those in law enforcement are dedicated public servants who serve honorably. At the same time, there are some communities , especially communities of color , who have not always held the same trust in law enforcement because of their experiences. When individuals in these communities are subject to racial profiling, excessive force, or other misconduct , they have a right to demand that police be held accountable.There are an estimated 16,000 to 18,000 local, state, and tribal law enforcement agencies in the United States with the average agency having fewer than 50 officers. In this respect, the American policing system is unique in that each of these agencies falls under the control of a local governing body, executive, or elected official(s). Local control is arguably one of the key characteristics that makes the American policing system unique. It is also the characteristic that presents the greatest challenge to establishing standardized ethical and professional practices within a system few deny is in need of reform. In order to reform the policing system, Kamala would:Support a national standard for use of deadly force to only when “necessary” and when no reasonable alternatives are available. The Camden Police Department, led by Chief Scott Thomson has instituted one of the most progressive use of force policies that might serve as a model. It incorporated stakeholder feedback from various stakeholders, including the New Jersey ACLU and the Fraternal Order of Police. The policy focuses on six core principles:(1) Officers may use force only to accomplish specific law enforcement objectives.(2) Whenever feasible, officers should attempt to de-escalate confrontations with the goal of resolving encounters without force. Officers may only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and as a last resort.(3) Officers must use only the amount of force that is proportionate to the circumstances.(4) Deadly force is only authorized as a last resort and only in strict accordance with this directive.(5) Officers must promptly provide or request medical aid.(6) Employees have a duty to stop and report uses of force that violate any applicable law and/or this directive.Create a National Police Systems Review Board. As noted above there are approximately 16,000 to 18,000 police departments in the United States, which means that safety standards and regulations vary from department to department. Independent bodies such as the National Transportation Safety Board have played a role in greatly reducing airplane crashes by recommending and implementing industry standards and regulations after airplane crashes.Kamala would work with Congress to create a National Police Systems Review Board, which would collect data and review police shootings and other cases of severe misconduct, and work to issue recommendations and implement safety standards based on evidence revealed in these reviews.Independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. Kamala would allocate resources to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to incentivize state agencies to conduct independent investigations of officer-involved shootings.Kamala has previously supported independent investigations as California’s Attorney General, for example, when she submitted a budget proposal to the Governor that would fund 3 California Department of Justice teams to investigate officer-involved shootings statewide.Increase resources for U.S. Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations and restore the use of consent decrees.Double the size of Civil Rights Division.Pass legislation that authorizes the Civil Rights Division to have subpoena power for their pattern and practice investigations. As CA AG, Kamala supported California Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations. Specifically, she opened civil pattern and practice investigations into the Bakersfield Police Department and Kern County Sheriff’s Office in response to community complaints and reports of excessive use of force and misconduct.Restore the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office’s ability to conduct voluntary organizational assessments of law enforcement agencies and provide recommendations and technical assistance to address deficient operational systems and problematic practices.Increase funding for body cameras and set standards for its use; Standards must take into account privacy concerns and community input.Invest federal resources to incentivize states to hire a diverse and qualified workforce;Invest federal money and create accountability mechanisms to incentivize state/local governments to provide police use of force training that includes: De-escalation; Crisis Intervention; Mental Health; Proportionality; Deadly force investigations; Providing medical treatment; Giving oral warnings when feasible; Psychological roots of bias; Procedural justice.Reform civil asset forfeiture laws to eliminate abuses such that it is only limited to cripple transnational gangs and major criminal enterprises , and not to profit and fund police departments.De-militarize police departments. Kamala would reinstate President Obama’s executive order, which prohibited sales of certain military equipment and placed reasonable access restraints and training requirements to ensure law enforcement had access to tools it needed without militarizing local police.Address racial disparities in technology used by law enforcement. Kamala would work with stakeholders, including civil rights groups, technology groups, and law enforcement, to institute regulations and protections to ensure that technology used by federal law enforcement , such as facial recognition and other surveillance , does not further racial disparities or other biases. She would also invest federal money to incentivize states and localities to do the same.Law Enforcement Transparency & Accountability via Data Collection and Analysis. As Attorney General, Kamala launched a first-of-its-kind open data platform called OpenJustice, which created an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability with the public about law enforcement activities in California. She would similarly do so on the federal level by:Require states receiving federal law enforcement funds to participate in the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Decertification Index (NDI).In the U.S., 46 states provide for revoking a police officer’s license or certificate when the officer has engaged in serious misconduct. This is the case in other professions as well, such as law and medicine. The IADLEST’s national registry provides information related to officer misconduct as reported by participating state government agencies. This list should be comprehensive and include all states. This would prohibit officers who committed serious misconduct from simply applying for law enforcement jobs in other states.Expand access to mental health services and trauma-informed care. In the United States, about 44 million adults are believed to experience a mental health condition in any given year. But over 20% of that group , 9 million American adults , report having an unmet need. And, according to some estimates, 56% of state prisoners and 64% of jail inmates have or have had mental health issues.Prioritize mental health informed responses. Because mental health care is profoundly under-resourced in America, the criminal justice system is nearly always the frontline response for individuals with mental health disorders, a reality that frequently results in officer use of deadly force. According to a 2015 report, a person with an untreated mental illness is 16 times more likely to be killed by a law enforcement officer than others who encounter law enforcement. A review by the Washington Post revealed that over 20% of individuals killed by a law enforcement officer in 2018 was experiencing a mental or emotional health crisis.Support proposals that de-emphasize criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues because, until we have successfully strengthened our mental health care system, the criminal justice system will continue to be tasked with frontline interactions with people whose primary need is mental health care. Increase funding for U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs grants to improve law enforcement-based responses to people with mental health issues, including training to verbally de-escalate encounters without resorting to physical force.Increase federal funding for the hiring of mental health professionals to accompany police officers in responding to calls involving individuals in mental crises.Increase federal grants that support mental health first aid programming that trains participants , teachers, community and city officials of all work functions, and city and community residents , in the critical steps for crisis intervention so that bystanders have the tools to help prevent deaths, assess harmful situations, and seek appropriate medical treatment. The goal is to make mental health first aid as common as regular first aid, such as CPR, which will reduce the need for criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues.Increase funding for officer safety and wellness. As noted by the Department of Justice, the occupational fatality rate for law enforcement is three to five times greater than the national average for the working population. Career dangerousness is compounded by exposure to the same traumatic environments that plague our most vulnerable communities. If our goal is healthy communities, the people sworn to protect them must also be healthy. It is therefore important to ensure that there is sufficient funding to address the physical and mental health, along with safety, of officers.Provide explicit authority to the U.S Department of Justice to conduct pattern and practice investigations of prosecutorial offices that commit systematic misconduct.Invest federal funds in data collection and data analysis for greater transparency and accountability.Require federal prosecutors to provide data on their charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing decisions.Provide funding to incentivize state prosecutors to participate in a national reporting program.Invest federal funds to assess prosecutorial priorities. The FBI invests millions of dollars into developing a threat assessment system that helps them set priorities. The same should be done with prosecutors so that they prioritize cases that do the most to promote public safety and justice.Support for public defenders to instill greater trust and equity in the justice system. Kamala believes we must support our public defender systems, which are straining to uphold the constitutional right to counsel for indigent defendants as required by the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Gideon v. Wainwright decision. Her EQUAL Defense Act would create a $250 million grant program to fund public defenders. To receive grants, states and localities must impose workload limits, achieve pay parity between public defenders and prosecutors within 5 years, and collect data on public defender workloads. Increases funding for public defender training. Increases student loan repayment program. Her legislation has been endorsed by Jon Rapping of Gideon’s Promise.End money bail. Our bail system is unjust and broken. 450,000 Americans sit in jail today awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail. Excessive cash bail disproportionately harms people from low-income communities and communities of color. Black defendants are more likely to be detained before trial and less likely to be able to post bail compared with similarly-situated White defendants. And Black men pay higher bail than similarly-situated White defendants. Kamala’s Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act with Senator Rand Paul was her first major bipartisan bill in the Senate. The bill provides grants to incentivize states to significantly reform their money bail systems to make them more just.End the use of fines and fees that criminalize the poor. Invest money in states to end the fines and fees system otherwise known as LFOs (Legal Financial Obligations), where individuals are incarcerated based on the inability to pay fines and fees. In addition, we need to eliminate court fees and fees associated with diversion, treatment, or community supervision that make it harder for individuals to reintegrate into society.End suspension of driver’s licenses for unpaid fines. Invest money in states to stop suspending driver’s licenses of those who cannot pay off their tickets or fines.Currently, more than 40 states use driver’s license suspension as punishment for failure to pay debts, include traffic or parking tickets, civil judgments from court, child support orders, and other debt. This is counterproductive and harmful to individuals who need to commute to their jobs, take their children to school, and otherwise support their family.Humane Treatment of PrisonersEnd the death penalty. Kamala believes the death penalty is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala declined to seek the death penalty in the prosecution of an individual accused of killing a police officer, despite facing relentless political pressure to do so.End solitary confinement. End solitary confinement, but ensure alternative therapeutic and rehabilitative mechanisms are available to protect the safety of individuals in prisons and of prison staff.End the profiting off of incarceration. Specifically, prohibit prisons from making a profit from charging exorbitant rates for prisoners for telecommunications and commissary/food and supplies in prison.Keeping Families Intact. Ripping families apart creates lasting harm and undermines the goal of building safer and healthier communities. We should strive to maintain family connections.Make it easier for family to visit prisoner,Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which Kamala cosponsors would:Clear nationwide rape kit backlog in first term. Invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again.As Attorney General, Kamala eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed.Kamala also backed California legislation in 2016 “to illuminate the state’s invisible backlog of untested rape kits,” and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.Protecting consumers against fraud and fighting for victims’ rights.

Click here for a PDF version of the pla.Reforming our criminal justice system is as complex and pressing an endeavor as any other in our lifetime. It is the civil rights issue of our time, and there is perhaps no one more uniquely suited to taking on this issue than Kamala Harris.From the civil rights protests she attended as a child, to her time working inside the system as a prosecutor, Kamala has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system. And because of her experiences, she has the insight and the fight to fundamentally transform the system for the better.At its best, the system serves to hold serious wrongdoers accountable and achieve justice for crime survivors, while helping to build safer and healthier communities. At its worst, decades of failed policies have created an unjust, unequal, and vastly expansive system that disproportionately harms communities of color and criminalizes individuals just because they are poor. It is long past time to re-envision public safety by strengthening and supporting our communities and drastically limiting the number of people we expose to our criminal justice system. As president, Kamala will fundamentally transform how we approach public safety.The criminal justice system in America is vast. There are about 2.3 million people in the nation's prisons and jails today. Of the 2.3 million people, nearly 2 million are in state prisons and local jails. Thus, it is important to understand that much of criminal justice policy occurs on the state and local level. However, the president also has an important role to play in effecting change.As president, there are four main levers that Kamala can exercise to change criminal justice policy. She can: (1) work with Congress and use her executive authority to change law and policy on the federal level; (2) investigate state and local actors through the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division; (3) empower and incentivize behavior on the state and local level through federal funding; and (4) use her voice as president to advocate for change. And as president, Kamala will exercise every one of these levers to increase public safety, reduce our outsized criminal justice system, and make it fairer and more equitable for all.Guiding Principles:(1) End Mass Incarceration and Invest Resources into Evidence and Community-Based Programs that Reduce Crime and Help Build Safe and Healthy Communitie,(2) Law Enforcement's Primary Mission is to Serve and Protect Communities. It Should Instill Trust and Be Accountable to the Communities It Serve,(3) The System Must Treat Individuals Equitably and Humanel,(4) The System Must Protect Vulnerable Peopl,There are about 2.3 million people in the nation's prisons and jails today, which is an increase from about 500,000 in 1980. But perhaps more importantly, people go to jail 10.6 million times every year. The number of jail admissions is perhaps a more accurate reflection of just how expansive the system is, and how much work is required to transform and contract the system. Worse, Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of White Americans; the incarceration rate for Black women is twice that of White women. And when these men and women are released from confinement, one report found that they face nearly 50,000 federal, state, and local legal restrictions that serve as barriers to reentry into society. For example, one study shows that a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50%, and the negative impact is even more considerable for Black applicants.End the 'War on Drugs' , One-fifth of the incarcerated population , or 456,000 people , is serving time for a drug charge while another 1.15 million are on probation and parole for drug-related offenses. This is especially the case on the federal level, where nearly half of the prison population are there for drug crimes. So it is past time to end the failed war on drugs, and it begins with legalizing marijuana. Marijuana arrests account for over 50% of all drug arrests. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple marijuana possession. Worse, despite roughly equal usage rates, Black people are about four times more likely than White people to be arrested for marijuana. Black Americans also make up nearly 30% of all drug-related arrests, despite accounting for only 12.5% of substance users.Legalizing marijuana. Support states in legalizing marijuana; legalize marijuana on the federal level, expunge convictions, and reinvest in the community.Kamala's Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act does the following: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy; Requires expungement and, on motion, re-sentencing for marijuana-based convictions; Creates 3 grant programs by assessing a sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products. The grant programs do the following:(1) Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid;(2) Provides states and localities with funds to make loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals;(3) Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Invest money in states to significantly reduce the incarceration of women convicted of non-violent offenses. While most are aware of the system's impact on men, it is less well known how quickly the incarcerated population for women has gone up. According to the Sentencing Project, 'the female incarcerated population stands nearly eight times higher than in 1980.' We must therefore focus on dramatically reducing the number of incarcerated women convicted of non-violent offenses by finding alternatives to incarceration.Sentencing Reforms. Significant reforms must be made with respect to the criminal justice system's sentencing schemes, including:End mandatory minimums on federal level and incentivize states to do the same. As a Senator, Kamala is a cosponsor of the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would eliminate all mandatory minimums by letting judges issue sentences below the mandatory minimum.Reform clemency process to form clemency/sentencing review units and significantly increase use of clemency.The clemency process needs to be removed from the Department of Justice where there are inherent conflicts of interest. Specifically, DOJ should not determine whether individuals convicted by their own colleagues should be shortened or commuted.For those who have been sentenced to long prison terms (i.e., 20 years or more), the sentencing review unit would provide for an assessment as to whether it is appropriate and serves the interests of justice for the incarcerated individual to be released or have their sentence shortened after having served 10 years.Reform community supervision.Invest money in states to shorten the length of probation and other forms of community supervision where appropriate and where it serves the interests of justice;Invest money in states to end jail time for technical violations of community- based supervision (reforming parole).End the use of private prisons. Less than 10 percent of our prison population is held in private facilities, but it is nevertheless still necessary to end the profit motive that drives these private prisons, as it is inhumane to profit off of imprisonment and allow a system that continues to create incentives that are contrary to the goal of helping people rehabilitate themselves and return to the community. Kamala also believe we must end private detention centers for undocumented immigrants.Several studies have demonstrated that children's earliest life experiences , from nourishment and reading to poverty and exposure to violence , have profound effects on their brain development and long-term health and safety. Even later in childhood, the brain maturity of our young people is fundamentally different from adults. As a result, children must be treated differently by our government, from the child welfare and education systems to our criminal justice system. We must invest in the building blocks of public safety by prioritizing the health, well-being, and safety of children from their earliest years to set them up to thrive as adults.Create a Bureau of Children and Family Justice.As the Attorney General of California, Kamala created the Bureau of Children's Justice to focus on children's civil rights in the child welfare, education, and juvenile justice systems.As president, Kamala would build and expand on that idea by creating a Bureau of Children and Family Justice to work across agencies in supporting communities and families, including investing in healthcare, education, jobs, and other wrap around services.As president, Kamala would address the broken foster care system and disrupt the pipeline of children from the child welfare system to the criminal justice system. She'll work with leaders like Rep. Karen Bass and the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth (CCFY) to ensure foster youth have the education, healthcare, and other wraparound services they need to heal from trauma and grow into healthy, thriving adults.Research shows that access to school-based health services has a positive impact on absences, dropout rates, disciplinary problems and other academic outcomes, in addition to the crucial health-related benefits these services provide. As president, Kamala will ensure that students continue to have access to school-based health services by requiring equivalent or better services to be covered and reimbursable under her Medicare for All plan.Invest money in states/localities to end juvenile incarceration in favor of restorative justice programs and wrap-around services, except for the most serious crimes.End life sentences of children and offer opportunities for sentence reduction to young people convicted of crimes. For example, fight to end de facto life without parole sentences by allowing youth sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for crimes committed before their 18th birthday to petition the original sentencing court for review of their sentence after they have served 10 years.End the transfer of children to adult prisons;End solitary confinement for children;Invest money in states to stop criminal charges for school-based disciplinary behavior;Invest money in states to hold schools accountable for discriminatory practices in suspensions and expulsions. As CA AG, Kamala launched an investigation into the Stockton Unified School District police department over concerns of racial discrimination in school discipline and school policing, including treatment of elementary school children. CA DOJ announced a comprehensive settlement in 2019 to resolve systemic civil rights violations of African American and Latinx students and students with disabilities.Make significant federal investment for innovative Back-on-Track programs that provide in-custody and out-of-custody education and comprehensive services to individuals convicted of crimes to reduce recidivism by equipping them with the tools they need to reenter society successfully.Education, job training, and treatment. Mandate that federal prisons provide educational and vocational training, and mental health and addiction treatment in custody, including diagnosis and treatment of trauma. Early in her career, Kamala worked with Dr. Nadine Burke Harris , now California's Surgeon General , to create the Center for Youth Wellness to screen children for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and treat the toxic stress that can have lasting effects on their physical and mental health. As president, she'll invest federal money to incentivize states to follow their lead.Reentry educational course. Mandate federal prisons to provide a reentry educational course that provides, among other things, information on acquiring identification and their options with respect to housing, education, treatment, and other assistance programs. Invest federal money into this program and incentivize states to provide the same reentry educational course.Create an advisory board of directly impacted individuals to make recommendations for successful re-entry.Expungement & Sealing, Automatic expungement and sealing of offenses that are not serious or violent after 5 year,Ban the box, i.e., remove questions about an individual's conviction histories until after conditional offers have been made. Individuals reentering society should have a meaningful opportunity to obtain a job and reintegrate into the community.Restore voting rights for all who have served their sentence.End federal bans on formerly-incarcerated individuals (as well as those arrested and not incarcerated) access to public housing, student loans, SNAP, and professional work licenses, including: Fair Chance at Housing Act of 2019: Kamala's bicameral bill introduced with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which helps remove barriers to obtaining federal housing assistance for individuals with criminal records.Prioritize enforcement of anti-discrimination laws/EEOC rules that prevent discrimination in employment, housing, etc. based on a prior convictions.Law enforcement is a critical part of our communities and we should appreciate the sacrifices of those who serve on our behalf. And we should also recognize that the majority of those in law enforcement are dedicated public servants who serve honorably. At the same time, there are some communities , especially communities of color , who have not always held the same trust in law enforcement because of their experiences. When individuals in these communities are subject to racial profiling, excessive force, or other misconduct , they have a right to demand that police be held accountable.There are an estimated 16,000 to 18,000 local, state, and tribal law enforcement agencies in the United States with the average agency having fewer than 50 officers. In this respect, the American policing system is unique in that each of these agencies falls under the control of a local governing body, executive, or elected official(s). Local control is arguably one of the key characteristics that makes the American policing system unique. It is also the characteristic that presents the greatest challenge to establishing standardized ethical and professional practices within a system few deny is in need of reform. In order to reform the policing system, Kamala would:Support a national standard for use of deadly force to only when 'necessary' and when no reasonable alternatives are available. The Camden Police Department, led by Chief Scott Thomson has instituted one of the most progressive use of force policies that might serve as a model. It incorporated stakeholder feedback from various stakeholders, including the New Jersey ACLU and the Fraternal Order of Police. The policy focuses on six core principles:(1) Officers may use force only to accomplish specific law enforcement objectives.(2) Whenever feasible, officers should attempt to de-escalate confrontations with the goal of resolving encounters without force. Officers may only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and as a last resort.(3) Officers must use only the amount of force that is proportionate to the circumstances.(4) Deadly force is only authorized as a last resort and only in strict accordance with this directive.(5) Officers must promptly provide or request medical aid.(6) Employees have a duty to stop and report uses of force that violate any applicable law and/or this directive.Create a National Police Systems Review Board. As noted above there are approximately 16,000 to 18,000 police departments in the United States, which means that safety standards and regulations vary from department to department. Independent bodies such as the National Transportation Safety Board have played a role in greatly reducing airplane crashes by recommending and implementing industry standards and regulations after airplane crashes.Kamala would work with Congress to create a National Police Systems Review Board, which would collect data and review police shootings and other cases of severe misconduct, and work to issue recommendations and implement safety standards based on evidence revealed in these reviews.Independent investigations of officer-involved shootings. Kamala would allocate resources to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to incentivize state agencies to conduct independent investigations of officer-involved shootings.Kamala has previously supported independent investigations as California's Attorney General, for example, when she submitted a budget proposal to the Governor that would fund 3 California Department of Justice teams to investigate officer-involved shootings statewide.Increase resources for U.S. Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations and restore the use of consent decrees.Double the size of Civil Rights Division.Pass legislation that authorizes the Civil Rights Division to have subpoena power for their pattern and practice investigations. As CA AG, Kamala supported California Department of Justice pattern and practice investigations. Specifically, she opened civil pattern and practice investigations into the Bakersfield Police Department and Kern County Sheriff's Office in response to community complaints and reports of excessive use of force and misconduct.Restore the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office's ability to conduct voluntary organizational assessments of law enforcement agencies and provide recommendations and technical assistance to address deficient operational systems and problematic practices.Increase funding for body cameras and set standards for its use; Standards must take into account privacy concerns and community input.Invest federal resources to incentivize states to hire a diverse and qualified workforce;Invest federal money and create accountability mechanisms to incentivize state/local governments to provide police use of force training that includes: De-escalation; Crisis Intervention; Mental Health; Proportionality; Deadly force investigations; Providing medical treatment; Giving oral warnings when feasible; Psychological roots of bias; Procedural justice.Reform civil asset forfeiture laws to eliminate abuses such that it is only limited to cripple transnational gangs and major criminal enterprises , and not to profit and fund police departments.De-militarize police departments. Kamala would reinstate President Obama's executive order, which prohibited sales of certain military equipment and placed reasonable access restraints and training requirements to ensure law enforcement had access to tools it needed without militarizing local police.Address racial disparities in technology used by law enforcement. Kamala would work with stakeholders, including civil rights groups, technology groups, and law enforcement, to institute regulations and protections to ensure that technology used by federal law enforcement , such as facial recognition and other surveillance , does not further racial disparities or other biases. She would also invest federal money to incentivize states and localities to do the same.Law Enforcement Transparency & Accountability via Data Collection and Analysis. As Attorney General, Kamala launched a first-of-its-kind open data platform called OpenJustice, which created an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability with the public about law enforcement activities in California. She would similarly do so on the federal level by:Require states receiving federal law enforcement funds to participate in the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Decertification Index (NDI).In the U.S., 46 states provide for revoking a police officer's license or certificate when the officer has engaged in serious misconduct. This is the case in other professions as well, such as law and medicine. The IADLEST's national registry provides information related to officer misconduct as reported by participating state government agencies. This list should be comprehensive and include all states. This would prohibit officers who committed serious misconduct from simply applying for law enforcement jobs in other states.Expand access to mental health services and trauma-informed care. In the United States, about 44 million adults are believed to experience a mental health condition in any given year. But over 20% of that group , 9 million American adults , report having an unmet need. And, according to some estimates, 56% of state prisoners and 64% of jail inmates have or have had mental health issues.Prioritize mental health informed responses. Because mental health care is profoundly under-resourced in America, the criminal justice system is nearly always the frontline response for individuals with mental health disorders, a reality that frequently results in officer use of deadly force. According to a 2015 report, a person with an untreated mental illness is 16 times more likely to be killed by a law enforcement officer than others who encounter law enforcement. A review by the Washington Post revealed that over 20% of individuals killed by a law enforcement officer in 2018 was experiencing a mental or emotional health crisis.Support proposals that de-emphasize criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues because, until we have successfully strengthened our mental health care system, the criminal justice system will continue to be tasked with frontline interactions with people whose primary need is mental health care. Increase funding for U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs grants to improve law enforcement-based responses to people with mental health issues, including training to verbally de-escalate encounters without resorting to physical force.Increase federal funding for the hiring of mental health professionals to accompany police officers in responding to calls involving individuals in mental crises.Increase federal grants that support mental health first aid programming that trains participants , teachers, community and city officials of all work functions, and city and community residents , in the critical steps for crisis intervention so that bystanders have the tools to help prevent deaths, assess harmful situations, and seek appropriate medical treatment. The goal is to make mental health first aid as common as regular first aid, such as CPR, which will reduce the need for criminal justice interventions in response to mental health issues.Increase funding for officer safety and wellness. As noted by the Department of Justice, the occupational fatality rate for law enforcement is three to five times greater than the national average for the working population. Career dangerousness is compounded by exposure to the same traumatic environments that plague our most vulnerable communities. If our goal is healthy communities, the people sworn to protect them must also be healthy. It is therefore important to ensure that there is sufficient funding to address the physical and mental health, along with safety, of officers.Provide explicit authority to the U.S Department of Justice to conduct pattern and practice investigations of prosecutorial offices that commit systematic misconduct.Invest federal funds in data collection and data analysis for greater transparency and accountability.Require federal prosecutors to provide data on their charging, plea bargaining, and sentencing decisions.Provide funding to incentivize state prosecutors to participate in a national reporting program.Invest federal funds to assess prosecutorial priorities. The FBI invests millions of dollars into developing a threat assessment system that helps them set priorities. The same should be done with prosecutors so that they prioritize cases that do the most to promote public safety and justice.Support for public defenders to instill greater trust and equity in the justice system. Kamala believes we must support our public defender systems, which are straining to uphold the constitutional right to counsel for indigent defendants as required by the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Gideon v. Wainwright decision. Her EQUAL Defense Act would create a $250 million grant program to fund public defenders. To receive grants, states and localities must impose workload limits, achieve pay parity between public defenders and prosecutors within 5 years, and collect data on public defender workloads. Increases funding for public defender training. Increases student loan repayment program. Her legislation has been endorsed by Jon Rapping of Gideon's Promise.End money bail. Our bail system is unjust and broken. 450,000 Americans sit in jail today awaiting trial because they cannot afford to pay bail. Excessive cash bail disproportionately harms people from low-income communities and communities of color. Black defendants are more likely to be detained before trial and less likely to be able to post bail compared with similarly-situated White defendants. And Black men pay higher bail than similarly-situated White defendants. Kamala's Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act with Senator Rand Paul was her first major bipartisan bill in the Senate. The bill provides grants to incentivize states to significantly reform their money bail systems to make them more just.End the use of fines and fees that criminalize the poor. Invest money in states to end the fines and fees system otherwise known as LFOs (Legal Financial Obligations), where individuals are incarcerated based on the inability to pay fines and fees. In addition, we need to eliminate court fees and fees associated with diversion, treatment, or community supervision that make it harder for individuals to reintegrate into society.End suspension of driver's licenses for unpaid fines. Invest money in states to stop suspending driver's licenses of those who cannot pay off their tickets or fines.Currently, more than 40 states use driver's license suspension as punishment for failure to pay debts, include traffic or parking tickets, civil judgments from court, child support orders, and other debt. This is counterproductive and harmful to individuals who need to commute to their jobs, take their children to school, and otherwise support their family.Humane Treatment of PrisonersEnd the death penalty. Kamala believes the death penalty is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. As San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala declined to seek the death penalty in the prosecution of an individual accused of killing a police officer, despite facing relentless political pressure to do so.End solitary confinement. End solitary confinement, but ensure alternative therapeutic and rehabilitative mechanisms are available to protect the safety of individuals in prisons and of prison staff.End the profiting off of incarceration. Specifically, prohibit prisons from making a profit from charging exorbitant rates for prisoners for telecommunications and commissary/food and supplies in prison.Keeping Families Intact. Ripping families apart creates lasting harm and undermines the goal of building safer and healthier communities. We should strive to maintain family connections.Make it easier for family to visit prisoner,Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which Kamala cosponsors would:Clear nationwide rape kit backlog in first term. Invest $1 billion to allow states to fully eliminate their rape-kit backlogs within four years and implement reforms to ensure a backlog does not happen again.As Attorney General, Kamala eliminated a longstanding backlog of DNA analysis and more than 1,000 untested rape kits in state-run labs and introduced new technology to dramatically increase the speed with which cases are analyzed.Kamala also backed California legislation in 2016 'to illuminate the state's invisible backlog of untested rape kits,' and in the U.S. Senate, she sponsors The Survivors' Access to Supportive Care Act, which would make rape kits more readily available at hospitals nationwide.Protecting consumers against fraud and fighting for victims' rights. Prioritize and double resources in DOJ to address corporate crimes and those who defraud consumers. For too long, corporate bad actors have escaped accountability because the justice system has not prioritized their wrongdoings. Just as Kamala did as AG, she will fight to protect consumers from fraud and for victims' rights.Big banks. Kamala secured $20 billion for California homeowners from the big banks for abusing the mortgage system and fueling the national foreclosure crisis.For-profit colleges. Kamala won a $1.1 billion judgment against the for-profit (and now defunct) Corinthian Colleges for their predatory and unlawful practices to defraud students.
MEKH199201923	Kamala Harris	2019-09-19	The Path Ahead	As we enter the fourth quarter of 2019, I wanted to provide an update on the state of our campaign and lay out some of our thinking about the path ahead. We are excited about the next four and a half months, as Kamala prepares to hit the trail hard and lay out why she’s the best candidate in this race to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and build a broad coalition to win and unite this country.This summer has been an important period on two key fronts: building our campaign infrastructure, and raising the resources necessary to kick that infrastructure into gear in the home stretch of this primary.Kamala has consistently been the candidate voters want to know more about and hear from more. There is so much interest in her historic candidacy, and when voters get to know her better, they really like her. Her favorability is strong and durable, and she’s well-regarded across a broad demographic coalition. She’s been rock solid in the top five in this historically large and sprawling field from the very beginning, and is well-positioned to break through and win the Democratic nomination.When it comes to public polls, it’s important to remember where we are. In October 2003, John Kerry, who went on to win the Democratic nomination, was polling in fifth place, at around 8 percent. At this point in 2007, Barack Obama trailed both Hillary Clinton and John Edwards consistently in Iowa caucus polls , and Clinton led national polls by an average of 18 points. (She led the national polls by double digits until the week after Iowa!) In 2015, Clinton led Bernie Sanders by 21 points in Iowa. She ended up only winning by less than half of 1 percent.I say all that not to make any excuses. But there have been about 25 Democratic primary horse race polls in the past 30 days, and they go up and down. Even the NBC/WSJ poll this week revealed that only 9 percent of respondents say they’ve made up their mind in this race. The media is going to keep feverishly covering these polls, but we can’t get too high or too low. We are focused on executing our plan and winning this election.This month is going to be important because it is really when we start to see the fruits of what we have been preparing for since the beginning of this race. October is when voters begin to really decide who they want to support in this primary, and we are hitting the gas.Following the five-day Iowa bus tour in August that took her 650 miles for 18 events in 11 counties, Kamala will double down on Iowa, campaigning there each week in October. We will add over 60 more organizers in state and open 10 more offices. This is an extension of the marker we laid down there this summer, when we grew our staff to 65 people and began work in 7 offices including our headquarters in Des Moines.Kamala has a unique message and appeal to caucus-goers who have so often defied conventional wisdom and expectations in the previous two cycles. We are under no illusions: we are asking Democratic voters and caucus-goers to do something that’s never been done before, to support a nominee that does not look like any nominee before now. That will take effort, energy, and resources up until caucus day. But this campaign is up for it, and Kamala Harris is up for it.As someone who has lived and worked in California, I have seen Kamala’s electoral history up close and personal. Whether it was taking on the machine and running for district attorney or polling at 6% in polls when she ran for Attorney General, she has always proven she could build a broad coalition to win. A lot of people in that state have bet against Kamala Harris and lost.Voters are still very much trying to decide who the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump is, and we feel strongly that Kamala will convince them it’s her over the next few months.She is going to make the case that we will not defeat Trump , especially in the critical states we must win to hit 270 electoral votes , by going backwards or longing for a bygone era with nostalgia, saying that we just need to go back to a “normal” that, frankly, was not working for millions of people. Trump was not elected because this country was working great for everyone.We also won’t get there by jumping headfirst into endless ideological fights that may further divide Americans at a time when so many people desperately want to bring the country together after three years of relentless division.Kamala is going to argue that we win by uniting this country around the common issues we’re all facing , regardless of demography or geography. She believes that Trump’s constant division is preventing us from getting anything done, and focusing on the “3AM issues” she has talked so much about, like concrete actions to stop gun violence and a sensible plan to give working and middle-class people $500 a month to make ends meet, is critical to defeating him and allowing us to write a new chapter where we actually achieve solutions to the problems we face.And she will continue to focus on pursuing justice , whether it’s against a lawless president, or companies who break the law and pollute our environment, or for women and people of color whose rights are being trampled by forces seeking to put them down.That’s what Kamala is going to focus on as we criss-cross Iowa and show voters why she is the best person to prosecute the case against four more years of Trump , and win.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/the-path-ahead-96d5269b0097?source=user_profile---------24----------------------------	Memo from Juan Rodriguez, Campaign Manager					As we enter the fourth quarter of 2019, I wanted to provide an update on the state of our campaign and lay out some of our thinking about the path ahead.

Whether it was taking on the machine and running for district attorney or polling at 6% in polls when she ran for Attorney General, she has always proven she could build a broad coalition to win. A lot of people in that state have bet against Kamala Harris and lost.Voters are still very much trying to decide who the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump is, and we feel strongly that Kamala will convince them it's her over the next few months.She is going to make the case that we will not defeat Trump , especially in the critical states we must win to hit 270 electoral votes , by going backwards or longing for a bygone era with nostalgia, saying that we just need to go back to a 'normal' that, frankly, was not working for millions of people. Trump was not elected because this country was working great for everyone.We also won't get there by jumping headfirst into endless ideological fights that may further divide Americans at a time when so many people desperately want to bring the country together after three years of relentless division.Kamala is going to argue that we win by uniting this country around the common issues we're all facing , regardless of demography or geography. She believes that Trump's constant division is preventing us from getting anything done, and focusing on the '3AM issues' she has talked so much about, like concrete actions to stop gun violence and a sensible plan to give working and middle-class people $500 a month to make ends meet, is critical to defeating him and allowing us to write a new chapter where we actually achieve solutions to the problems we face.And she will continue to focus on pursuing justice , whether it's against a lawless president, or companies who break the law and pollute our environment, or for women and people of color whose rights are being trampled by forces seeking to put them down.That's what Kamala is going to focus on as we criss-cross Iowa and show voters why she is the best person to prosecute the case against four more years of Trump , and win.
MEKH211201922	Kamala Harris	2019-11-02	Justice Is On The Ballot	Good evening, Iowa! So we all know why we are here. We are here because this is a moment. This is a moment where we have to be prepared to fight for the best of our country.This is a moment where we need to fight for this country we love, for the rule of law, for our system of justice, and for our very democracy. So we are all here to fight. We’re all here to fight to end that national nightmare called Donald Trump. And to win, Democrats. To win.It can’t be about anything other than looking at the future. It can’t be about looking at yesterday; we need to be focused on tomorrow. To win, we are going to have to fight against those who have been trying to push hate and division among us and have Americans turn on each other.To win, we’re going to have to fight for what I know in my heart and in my soul to be true , which is in the beauty and diversity of who we are as a nation, we all have so much more in common than what separates us.And to win, we are going to need a nominee on that stage with Donald Trump who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump , and Iowa, you are looking at her.In fact the first time I walked into a courtroom, I spoke five words. ‘Kamala Harris, For the People.’And those words, ‘For the People,’ capture our system of justice. Because there are two points when we say for the people. One, in our system of justice, we have rightly said that a harm against anyone is a harm against everyone , that no one should ever be made to fight alone. And for the people, when I stood there, and when I stand here today, also means all the people. Regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation, regardless of the party with which they are registered to vote, regardless of the language your grandmother speaks. It means all the people.And it was for the people that a large part of my early career was about fighting against those who molested children and raped women , because it was about saying that those survivors deserved justice and a voice that gave them safety without judgment. For the People.When I was elected District Attorney of San Francisco, saying that the war on drugs was an abject failure , so I created national models about what it means to give jobs to people who are arrested for drugs. For the People.When I was the Attorney General of California, running the second largest Department of Justice only to the United States Department of Justice, it meant taking on the biggest banks in the United States, who had engaged in predatory lending practices, and bringing back to the homeowners of my state $20 billion.And I will say that, in the name of the people, I believe that in 2020 justice is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot when, in America, there is a father who is holding down two jobs, trying to figure out how to get through the end of the month , and paying more taxes than the richest 400 families in America. Economic justice is on the ballot.So I am running for president to pass the largest middle-class tax cut we have had in history. And you want to know how we are going to pay for it? On day one, we’re going to repeal that tax bill the benefits that top one percent and the biggest corporations in America.When, in America, there is a mother, who is in a parking lot of a hospital afraid to walk through the sliding glass doors to get into the emergency room with her child, because she knows that she , if she walks through the sliding glass doors, she will be out of pocket a $4,000 deductible. Health care justice is on the ballot.To care for all. To bring down costs. And to ensure that you also get choice. Because I heard from folks that said, ‘Do not take away my opportunity to have a private plan.’ So you will get a private plan or public plan depending on your choice.When we are looking at teachers across America, and in Iowa, holding down two or three jobs to get through the end of the month. Education justice is on the ballot.When all over America, women are being attacked for their constitutional right to make decisions about their own bodies. Reproductive justice is on the ballot.So I am running to ensure every woman will have her legal and constitutional right , and not these out of date Republican legislators telling women what to do with their bodies.When children in America, regardless of who their parents voted for for president are afraid to go to school, because they are afraid they may get shot. They are afraid they will be a gunman roaming the hallways of their school. Justice for children is on the ballot.So I am running for president to take executive action, if necessary, and implement what people who have failed to have courage have not done , which is take on the gun lobby in Washington, D.C.And I want to give a shout out to Beto. Because he had the courage to say, look, you cannot walk around talking about gun safety but not have the courage to figure out how you’re going to take five million assault weapons off the streets of America.Justice is on the ballot.So it is time that we fight. And this is a fight that is about all of us.Because, yes, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. And here’s the bottom line, Iowa. I do believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will unlock the promise of America and the potential of the American people. And I do believe that this is what we want and need. That is the America I see. That is the America I believe in. That is the America I know us to be. And that is why I am running for president of the United States.Please join me and caucus with me in Kamala’s corner. Thank you.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/justice-is-on-the-ballot-e3f18399d2d5?source=user_profile---------23----------------------------	Kamala Harris’ speech at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty and Justice Celebration					Good evening, Iowa!

MEKH312201920	Kamala Harris	2019-12-03	I am suspending my campaign today	Eleven months ago at the launch of our campaign in Oakland I told you all: “I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. I will speak the truth.”And that’s what I have tried to do every day of this campaign. So here’s the truth today.I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life.My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.In good faith, I can’t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don’t believe I do.So, to you my supporters, it is with deep regret , but also with deep gratitude , that I am suspending my campaign today.But I want to be clear with you: I am still very much in this fight.And I will keep fighting every day for what this campaign has been about. Justice for The People. All the people.Our campaign has been about fighting for people whose voices that have not been heard or too often ignored.We will keep up that fight.Let’s remember: we were the first to put the injustice of inadequate teacher pay on the national agenda.We will keep up that fight.We were the first to demand justice for our children, declaring we would take bold executive actions to stop gun violence.We will keep up that fight.We were the first to demand justice for women with a plan to block unconstitutional state abortion laws.We will keep up that fight.And our campaign uniquely spoke to the experiences of Black women and people of color , and their importance to the success and future of this party. Our campaign demanded no one should be taken for granted by any political party.We will keep up that fight because no one should be made to fight alone.And I believe our campaign showed every child in America , regardless of their color or gender , that there are no limits to who can lead and hold positions of power in our country.In that way , this campaign has been so much bigger than me.I am extremely grateful to the hundreds of staff who moved and uprooted their lives and sacrificed time away from their families. I know our fight has been personal for each of them.Of course, I could not have done this without my husband Doug and my entire family and friends who gave up so much to embark on this journey with me and have supported me every step of the way.And I am grateful to the thousands of volunteers and contributors who chipped in, who knocked on doors, who made calls and who put their faith and trust in me. It has been the honor of my life to be your candidate.And I want to be clear: although I am no longer running for President, I will do everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump and fight for the future of our country and the best of who we are.I know you will too. So let’s do that together.Let’s keep fighting for the America we believe in, an America free of injustice.

MEKH1912201919	Kamala Harris	2019-12-19	Impeachment	It’s been a few weeks since we made the heartbreaking decision to suspend our campaign for president. Since then, Donald Trump has sought to continue to flout the Constitution and the rule of law.I wanted to reach out to you with a note about what will happen when the impeachment trial comes to the Senate, and our solemn duty to seek justice against this corrupt president and administration.Last night, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Donald Trump. Sometime early in the new year, I will take an oath on the Senate floor to uphold the Constitution, review evidence, and follow the facts wherever they lead , regardless of party or ideology.As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of holding powerful people accountable. I know that every trial requires fairness and truth. Any trial that abandons the pursuit of truth cannot be considered fair or just.But Mitch McConnell appears more interested in covering up the president’s misconduct than in pursuing truth and fairness. He’s already trying to limit the impeachment trial by preventing witnesses from testifying, and he has all but announced a verdict. In doing so, he showed the American people that he has no intention of honoring his oath.Let’s be clear: Mitch McConnell doesn’t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover-up.Fortunately, McConnell does not have the power to unilaterally undermine this trial. Every single senator will be empowered with an equal vote on how the trial will proceed.In this trial, senators will be far more than jurors. Each of us will vote to determine the rules for the trial, decide which witnesses testify, and ultimately serve as both court and jury.Each of us will be called on to uphold our oath with every decision we make. And we will all be held accountable by the American people if we refuse to discover the facts relevant to the articles of impeachment.Senator Schumer has made a reasonable request to hear from additional witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the president’s misconduct.We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who admitted to Mr. Trump’s bribery scheme on live television.We need to hear from the former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has been shopping stories about Trump to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress.Even Richard Nixon allowed the key figures behind the Watergate scandal to speak to Congress, and he eventually turned over incriminating portions of his Oval Office recordings to investigators.But Trump has stonewalled Congress and inhibited our ability to seek justice by demanding that those closest to the center of the Ukraine scandal stay silent.The Senate should not vote on any article of impeachment or consider a motion to dismiss the trial until we have reviewed the additional testimony and evidence that we have requested.I have never been in a courtroom where the accused can unilaterally block witnesses from testifying or prohibit prosecutors from asking witnesses questions. No court would allow a trial to proceed this way, and neither should any member of the Senate.Ensuring the integrity of this trial is a solemn responsibility for every senator, with consequences that extend far beyond any one presidency. My colleagues and I have a duty to use our voice and our vote to insist on a fair trial, rooted in the pursuit of truth.We must demonstrate to the American people that in our system of justice all are equal under law, and that there are not two sets of rules, one for Donald Trump and another for everybody else.History will judge the actions taken by the United States Senate at a time when our Constitution and the rule of law were at stake. I’ll continue to fight for justice and accountability, and my colleagues should too.Thanks for being a part of our continued fight for justice.For The People , always., Kamala Harris	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/impeachment-28d6b84c0058?source=user_profile---------20----------------------------	EmptySummary					It's been a few weeks since we made the heartbreaking decision to suspend our campaign for president.

MEKH273202018	Kamala Harris	2020-03-27	I voted YES on the coronavirus relief bill, here’s why	This week, I voted YES on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, and I wanted to let you know why.The original Republican bill released did not address the pain everyday Americans are feeling. It failed our workers by bailing out big industries without requiring them to keep people employed or ensure workers are protected.While far from perfect, the bill puts workers first and addresses some of the biggest issues we are facing.Here are some of the things Democrats fought for and won:We did all of this because the American people need to know that help is on the way.Our economy is made up of working people like cashiers, domestic workers, farm workers, small business owners, truck drivers, and teachers.And right now, millions of these Americans are wondering how they’re going to make their rent or mortgage payments in April. They have to be our priority, not corporations and not Wall Street.Which is why the Senate needs to get right back to work. Our job isn’t done.We need monthly payments for individuals and small businesses, and we need urgent help for laid off workers who lost their health care in the midst of this crisis.As long as I’m in the Senate you can bet I will continue to fight for the people. This bill was just a step, there’s plenty more work to do to help Americans in need.I’ll be in touch again soon with more updates, but for now stay at home if you can and check in with family and friends, because we are in this together.My very best,Kamala	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/i-voted-yes-on-the-coronavirus-relief-bill-heres-why-6eac0248e9e1?source=user_profile---------18----------------------------	EmptySummary					This week, I voted YES on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, and I wanted to let you know why.The original Republican bill released did not address the pain everyday Americans are feeling.

MEKH128202013	Kamala Harris	2020-08-12	I’m honored to join Joe Biden in the fight for the soul of our country	I am coming to you today with some big news: I’m honored to join Joe Biden in the fight for the soul of our country as the Democratic Vice Presidential Nominee. Joe is a leader who can unify the American people, because he’s spent his life fighting for the American people. And as president, he will build an America that lives up to our ideals.My mom and dad, like so many other immigrants, came to this country for an education. My mother from India and my dad from Jamaica. And the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s brought them together. Some of my earliest memories are from that time: My parents being attacked by police with hoses, fleeing for safety, with me strapped tightly in my stroller.That spirit of activism is why my mother, Shyamala, would always tell my sister and me, “Don’t just sit around and complain about things. Do something.”That’s why I became a District Attorney and fought to fix a broken system from within. Why I served as California’s Attorney General. Why I’m proud to represent my state as a U.S. Senator. And it’s why, today, I’m humbled to be joining Joe Biden in the battle to defeat Donald Trump and build a country that lives up to our values of truth, equality, and justice.I know that winning this race will be tougher than anything I’ve faced before, but I’ve never been more ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work. Donald Trump thinks this country belongs to him. But Joe Biden knows it belongs to all of us.

MEKH208202012	Kamala Harris	2020-08-20	Kamala Harris Accepts Vice-Presidential Nomination	Greetings America.It is truly an honor to be speaking with you.That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me. Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all.This week marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. And we celebrate the women who fought for that right.Yet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification.But they were undeterred.Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched and fought , not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table. These women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed.They paved the way for the trailblazing leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.And these women inspired us to pick up the torch , and fight on.Women like Mary Church Terrell and Mary McCleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm.We’re not often taught their stories. But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.There’s another woman, whose name isn’t known, whose story isn’t shared. Another woman whose shoulders I stand on. And that’s my mother , Shyamala Gopalan Harris.She came here from India at age 19 to pursue her dream of curing cancer. At the University of California Berkeley, she met my father, Donald Harris, who had come from Jamaica to study economics.They fell in love in that most American way , while marching together for justice in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.In the streets of Oakland and Berkeley, I got a stroller’s-eye view of people getting into what the great John Lewis called “good trouble.”When I was 5, my parents split and my mother raised us mostly on her own. Like so many mothers, she worked around the clock to make it work , packing lunches before we woke up , and paying bills after we went to bed. Helping us with homework at the kitchen table , and shuttling us to church for choir practice.She made it look easy, though I know it never was.My mother instilled in my sister, Maya, and me the values that would chart the course of our lives.She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.She taught us to put family first , the family you’re born into and the family you choose.Family is my husband Doug, who I met on a blind date set up by my best friend.Family is our beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who as you just heard, call me Momala.Family is my sister.Family is my best friend, my nieces and my godchildren.Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.Family is Mrs. Shelton , my second mother who lived two doors down and helped raise me.Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha our Divine 9 and my HBCU brothers and sisters.Family is the friends I turned to when my mother , the most important person in my life , passed away from cancer.And even as she taught us to keep our family at the center of our world, she also pushed us to see a world beyond ourselves.She taught us to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people. To believe public service is a noble cause and the fight for justice is a shared responsibility.That led me to become a lawyer, a district attorney, attorney general and a United States Senator.And at every step of the way, I’ve been guided by the words I spoke from the first time I stood in a courtroom: Kamala Harris, for the people.I’ve fought for children and survivors of sexual assault. I’ve fought against transnational gangs. I took on the biggest banks and helped take down one of the biggest for-profit colleges.I know a predator when I see one.My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman , all of five feet tall , who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California.On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America.I do so, committed to the values she taught me. To the word that teaches me to walk by faith, and not by sight. And to a vision passed on through generations of Americans , one that Joe Biden shares. A vision of our nation as a beloved community , where all are welcome, no matter what we look like, where we come from or who we love.A country where we may not agree on every detail, but we are united by the fundamental belief that every human being is of infinite worth, deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.A country where we look out for one another, where we rise and fall as one, where we face our challenges and celebrate our triumphs , together.Today that country feels distant.Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods.If you’re a parent struggling with your child’s remote learning, or you’re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we’re doing right now isn’t working.And we are a nation that’s grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy and, yes, the loss of certainty.And while this virus touches us all, let’s be honest, it is not an equal opportunity offender. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately.This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism.Of inequities in education and technology, health care and housing, job security and transportation.The injustice in reproductive and maternal health care. In the excessive use of force by police. And in our broader criminal justice system.This virus has no eyes, and yet it knows exactly how we see each other , and how we treat each other.And let’s be clear , there is no vaccine for racism. We’ve gotta do the work.For George Floyd. For Breonna Taylor. For the lives of too many others to name. For our children. For all of us.We’ve gotta do the work to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. Because none of us are free until all of us are free .We’re at an inflection point.The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone.It’s a lot.And here’s the thing: We can do better and deserve so much more.We must elect a president who will bring something different, something better and do the important work. A president who will bring all of us together , Black, White, Latino, Asian, Indigenous , to achieve the future we collectively want.We must elect Joe Biden.I knew Joe as vice president. I knew Joe on the campaign trail. But I first got to know Joe as the father of my friend.Joe’s son, Beau, and I served as attorneys general of our states , Delaware and California. During the Great Recession, we spoke on the phone nearly every day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks that foreclosed on people’s homes.And Beau and I would talk about his family.How, as a single father, Joe would spend four hours every day riding the train back and forth from Wilmington to Washington. Beau and Hunter got to have breakfast every morning with their dad. They went to sleep every night with the sound of his voice reading bedtime stories. And while they endured an unspeakable loss, these two little boys always knew that they were deeply, unconditionally loved.And what also moved me about Joe is the work he did, as he went back and forth. This is the leader who wrote the Violence Against Women Act , and enacted the Assault Weapons Ban; who, as vice president, implemented the Recovery Act, which brought our country back from the Great Recession. He championed the Affordable Care Act, protecting millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions; who spent decades promoting American values and interests around the world, standing up with our allies and standing up to our adversaries.Right now, we have a president who turns our tragedies into political weapons.Joe will be a president who turns our challenges into purpose.Joe will bring us together to build an economy that doesn’t leave anyone behind. Where a good-paying job is the floor, not the ceiling.Joe will bring us together to end this pandemic and make sure that we are prepared for the next one.Joe will bring us together to squarely face and dismantle racial injustice, furthering the work of generations.Joe and I believe that we can build that beloved community, one that is strong and decent, just and kind. One in which we all can see ourselves.That’s the vision that our parents and grandparents fought for. The vision that made my own life possible. The vision that makes the American promise , for all its complexities and imperfections , a promise worth fighting for.Make no mistake, the road ahead will not be not easy. We will stumble. We may fall short. But I pledge to you that we will act boldly and deal with our challenges honestly. We will speak truths. And we will act with the same faith in you that we ask you to place in us.We believe that our country , all of us , will stand together for a better future. We already are.We see it in the doctors, the nurses, the home health care workers and the frontline workers who are risking their lives to save people they’ve never met.We see it in the teachers and truck drivers, the factory workers and farmers, the postal workers and the poll workers, all putting their own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic.And we see it in so many of you who are working, not just to get us through our current crises but to somewhere better.There’s something happening all across the country.It’s not about Joe or me.It’s about you.It’s about us. People of all ages and colors and creeds who are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors and getting out the vote.And we’ve shown that, when we vote, we expand access to health care, expand access to the ballot box and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.I’m so inspired by a new generation of leadership. You are pushing us to realize the ideals of our nation, pushing us to live the values we share: decency and fairness, justice and love.You are the patriots who remind us that to love our country is to fight for the ideals of our country.In this election, we have a chance to change the course of history. We’re all in this fight.You, me and Joe , together.What an awesome responsibility. What an awesome privilege.So, let’s fight with conviction. Let’s fight with hope. Let’s fight with confidence in ourselves, and a commitment to each other , to the America we know is possible, the America we love.Years from now, this moment will have passed. And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and ask us: “Where were you when the stakes were so high?”They will ask us, “What was it like?”And we will tell them. We will tell them not just how we felt.We will tell them what we did.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/kamala-harris-accepts-vice-presidential-nomination-c9b1b6bc00ff?source=user_profile---------12----------------------------	Transcript of Kamala Harris’ Vice Presidential acceptance speech, as prepared for delivery					Greetings America.It is truly an honor to be speaking with you.That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me.

MEKH278202011	Kamala Harris	2020-08-27	Senator Harris remarks in advance of the Republican National Convention tonight	Good afternoon.On this eve of the 57th March on Washington, I will speak about the recent events in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The wildfires raging across the California coast to the Rocky Mountains. The storm which is working its way through Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. And most of all , about who we are as a country. We are a nation that, at its best, loves, protects, and helps our fellow Americans.Today, we see pain, hurt, and destruction in the ashes of wildfires and the damage of Hurricane Laura.We encourage everyone to continue following guidance from your local authorities to stay safe.And Joe and I pledge to be there for those whose lives have been turned upside down.Those who will need help from neighbors, strangers, and our government to make it through, to build back, to restore your lives and your communities.We also see pain, hurt, and destruction in the aftermath of yet another Black man shot by police.Jacob Blake, shot 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 young sons. 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 sons.As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr. Blake pierced the soul of our nation.It’s sickening to watch. It’s all too familiar. And it must end.Thankfully, he is alive today. But he is fighting for his life and shouldn’t have to be. My heart goes out to the Blake family, as they endure an ordeal that is tragically common in our country. Joe and I spoke with them yesterday. They are an amazing group of people with extraordinary courage. Even in their pain and grief, even as they seek justice for their son , they spoke about the need to end the violence and heal our nation. I’ve had conversations like this with far too many mothers and fathers , but you will see and hear no one with more courage, more character, and more moral clarity.People are rightfully angry and exhausted. And after the murders of Breonna, George, Ahmaud, and so many others, it’s no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them. We must always defend peaceful protest , and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including, the shooter who was arrested for murder. And make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice. Here’s my promise to those mothers and fathers, and all who stand with them:In a Biden-Harris Administration, you will have a seat at the table , in the Halls of Congress, and in the White House.We all grew up reciting the pledge of allegiance, but now, we must give real meaning to its words.One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Justice. Let’s talk about that. Because the reality is that the life of a Black person in America has never been treated as fully human , and we have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under law. We will only achieve that when we finally come together to pass meaningful police reform and broader criminal justice reform, and acknowledge, yes acknowledge, and address systemic racism.We will only come closer to achieving that when we finally come together.We have come a long way in our country towards building a more perfect Union, and the time is now , right now , to take the next step forward.And even as we experience this reckoning with racial injustice, we must also confront another crisis:The pandemic that has torn apart so many lives.The numbers that define this crisis are staggering.We cannot look the other way or allow ourselves to become numb to them.Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus.180,000 lives lost.More than 50 million claims for unemployment this year alone.We need to see , and we need to hear , what’s happening in our country.The quiet desperation that has taken over so many lives in America.The family packing into their car at 5 in the morning , hoping the local food bank still has something left when they get to the front of the line.The 50-year old store manager who’s been laid off , and knows he can’t pay the rent on the 1st of the month.The mothers and fathers stretched to the breaking point , working from home while helping their kids with online classes , just trying to hold it all together.The small business owners , economic engines of our communities , who are shutting their doors every day.The nurse getting ready for her afternoon shift , who has seen so much suffering and death in recent months , and wonders how much more she can bear to witness.The family grieving the loss of their grandmother who has been in a nursing home , who they couldn’t even visit over the last three months of her life.The alarming and disproportionate rate at which Black, Latino, and Indigenous families are contracting and dying of COVID-19.That is the reality of America right now. A reality completely absent from this week’s Republican National Convention.Because unlike the Democratic convention, which was clear-eyed about the challenges we are facing and how we will tackle them.The Republican convention is designed for one purpose , to soothe Donald Trump’s ego. To make him feel good. But here’s the thing, he’s the President of the United States. And it’s not Supposed to be about him.It’s supposed to be about the health, and the safety, and the well-being of the American people.And on that measure, Donald Trump has failed.You see, at its most basic level, Donald Trump doesn’t understand the presidency.He thinks it’s all about him. Well, it’s not. It’s about you. It’s about all of us. The People.As a lawyer and advocate, when I would rise to speak in a courtroom, I’d say the following words:Kamala Harris for the people. And that is why I stand here today , to speak for the people. Because we know the truth.Donald Trump has failed at the most basic and important job of a President of the United States. He failed to protect the American people. Plain and simple. Trump showed what we, in the legal profession, would call a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American people.A reckless disregard for the danger a pandemic would pose to American lives. For the devastation it would do to our economy. For the damage it would do to communities of color who have been subjected to structural racism for generations.For the chaos that would upend our daily lives make it impossible for many of our kids to go to school make it impossible to live normally and with certainty.He never appreciated that a President swears an oath before God and country to protect America against threats seen and unseen.It’s his duty. It’s his obligation to protect us.And yet, he has failed. Miserably. Here’s the thing, Donald Trump’s incompetence is nothing new.That has always been on full display. But in January of this year, it became deadly. That’s when the threat of a virus that would endanger the world first emerged.Trump dismissed the threat. Joe Biden, sounded the alarm. It would be the beginning of a pattern that persists to this day.Trump telling us not to worry, that the virus will, quote, “disappear,” that a quote, “miracle” is coming. Joe Biden, saying we need a plan, a national strategy, a President who is willing to lead, willing to be a role model for our nation. For our children. Trump still doesn’t have a plan.Joe Biden, released his first plan in March. Here’s what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic. It’s relentless. You can’t stop it with a tweet. You can’t create a distraction and hope it’ll go away. It doesn’t go away. By its nature, a pandemic is unforgiving. If you get it wrong at the beginning, the consequences are catastrophic. It’s very hard to catch up. You don’t get a second chance at getting it right. Well, President Trump got it wrong in the beginning.And then, he got it wrong again and again.And the consequences have been catastrophic. And here’s why Trump has been so unwilling and unable to deal with this crisis: First, he was fixated on the stock market over fixing the problem.He tweeted about it consistently during this period.He was convinced that if his administration focused on this virus, it would hurt the market and hurt his chances of being reelected.That mattered more to him than saving American lives. Second, right at the moment that we needed Donald Trump to be tough on the Chinese government, he caved.On January 24th, he praised the transparency of the Chinese government.He said, quote, “China has been working hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.”But they weren’t being transparent. They blocked public health inspectors from the CDC, from getting the access and information they needed to protect American lives.Donald Trump stood idly by. And folks, it was a deadly decision.Instead of rising to meet the most difficult moment of his presidency, Donald Trump froze. He was scared. He was petty and vindictive.On a call with governors across the country on March 16th, he told them it wasn’t his job to get personal protective equipment to frontline workers.He said, quote: “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment, try getting it yourselves.” Unquote.On that day we had about 5,000 cases as a nation.Today we have nearly 6 million.Even now , some eight months into this crisis , Donald Trump still won’t take responsibility. He still won’t act. The tragedy in all of this is it didn’t have to be this bad. Just look around. It’s not like this in the rest of the world.All we needed was a competent president , one who was willing to listen, willing to lead, take responsibility, have a plan, do their job.Joe Biden will be that president.He’s got a national strategy.He’s more than ready to lead.Every month since March as this pandemic has unfolded, Joe Biden has updated the steps he would take to save American lives. And he’s done it based on what every scientist, every expert, every economist, said we should be doing.As President, Joe Biden will put a plan into effect on day one.Develop and deploy rapid tests with immediate results.Make sure testing, treatments, and ultimately, a vaccine reach all Americans, including communities of color, who have historically been left behind.Manufacture the medical supplies and protective equipment we need.And make them right here , in America, so we’re never again at the mercy of China and other foreign countries to protect our own people. Joe and I will make sure our schools have all the resources they need , to be open, safe, and effective.Put politics aside , and not silence the experts , so the public gets the information they need and deserve.And put in place a nationwide mask Mandate , in Joe’s words, it’s not a burden to protect each other.Because he knows we’re all in this together.Donald Trump says there’s nothing he could have done to prevent all this death.Here’s the truth: Barack Obama and Joe Biden had a program called PREDICT that tracked emerging diseases in places like China. I’m going to repeat that. The program tracked emerging diseases in places like China. Trump cut it.They dedicated a team on the National Security Council to global health security and biodefense. Donald Trump eliminated it.They implemented standards for nursing homes to improve infection control. Trump is erasing them.Before the virus hit, Trump made our country vulnerable. After it was struck, he failed to do what was necessary.As it continues, he’s making it worse every day.Just this week, the Social Security Administration said a cut to Social Security like the one Trump is proposing would end disability benefits within one year and end All benefits within 3 years.Let me be as clear as possible, if Donald Trump’s extreme proposal goes into effect, the checks that America’s seniors rely on to pay your bills, to buy your medicine , to live , will stop coming.The very people who have suffered so greatly in this crisis.It’s unthinkable.And in the middle of a health crisis made worse by his own actions, Donald Trump is in court right now trying to throw out the entire Affordable Care Act, including the protections it provides for people with pre-existing conditions.That means, if you are fortunate enough to survive COVID-19, insurers could deny you coverage for treating any long-term effects.Now President Trump, won’t tell you any of this at the Republican convention tonight.And we all know he’s not changing.The president he has been , is the president he will be.But we have a chance to right these wrongs and put America on a better path forward.One where the leaders we elect listen to the experts and follow the best medical guidance to keep us and our families healthy and safe.One where we take meaningful action against systems and traditions of oppression.One where we stop fanning the flames of hate and division, and treat one another with the respect and dignity that each one of us deserves.As Joe Biden said in his acceptance speech, we have a choice between the light and the dark.I believe America will choose the light.Thank you.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/senator-harris-remarks-in-advance-of-the-republican-national-convention-tonight-92386cf937af?source=user_profile---------11----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Senator Kamala Harris in Washington, DC					Good afternoon.On this eve of the 57th March on Washington, I will speak about the recent events in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The wildfires raging across the California coast to the Rocky Mountains. The storm which is working its way through Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. And most of all , about who we are as a country. We are a nation that, at its best, loves, protects, and helps our fellow Americans.Today, we see pain, hurt, and destruction in the ashes of wildfires and the damage of Hurricane Laura.We encourage everyone to continue following guidance from your local authorities to stay safe.And Joe and I pledge to be there for those whose lives have been turned upside down.Those who will need help from neighbors, strangers, and our government to make it through, to build back, to restore your lives and your communities.We also see pain, hurt, and destruction in the aftermath of yet another Black man shot by police.Jacob Blake, shot 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 young sons. 7 times in the back in broad daylight in front of his 3 sons.As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr. Blake pierced the soul of our nation.It's sickening to watch. It's all too familiar. And it must end.Thankfully, he is alive today. But he is fighting for his life and shouldn't have to be. My heart goes out to the Blake family, as they endure an ordeal that is tragically common in our country. Joe and I spoke with them yesterday. They are an amazing group of people with extraordinary courage. Even in their pain and grief, even as they seek justice for their son , they spoke about the need to end the violence and heal our nation. I've had conversations like this with far too many mothers and fathers , but you will see and hear no one with more courage, more character, and more moral clarity.People are rightfully angry and exhausted. And after the murders of Breonna, George, Ahmaud, and so many others, it's no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them. We must always defend peaceful protest , and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including, the shooter who was arrested for murder. And make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice. Here's my promise to those mothers and fathers, and all who stand with them:In a Biden-Harris Administration, you will have a seat at the table , in the Halls of Congress, and in the White House.We all grew up reciting the pledge of allegiance, but now, we must give real meaning to its words.One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.Justice.

MEKH289202010	Kamala Harris	2020-09-28	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the future of the Supreme Court	Good afternoon.On Friday morning, I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the U.S. Capitol.She was the first woman in our history to lie in state.I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects.It was somber and personal.And it was an extraordinary moment for me , as I’m sure it was for you and millions of Americans, and people around the world who felt a connection with her.It was sad because we lost a giant not only of the Court, but of American life.It was a celebration.Few people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us.For each of us to be better, to stay in the fight , and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most.That phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court: “Equal Justice Under Law.”Justice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook, but from life.Her own life. She often told the story of how she had personally felt the sting of discrimination.As a woman.As the mother of a young child, trying to find work.And so she committed her life step by step, case by case, law by law, to tear down the obstacles in the way of so many, especially women.Now, we are about to undertake the task of finding her replacement on the United States Supreme Court.Of course, it’s hard to say those words.In truth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced.She was an original. A one of a kind.She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend an open hand, never a closed fist.She demonstrated you could both hold firm to your principles and still hear those with whom you disagree.That is a lesson that should be ringing in our ears.But it looks like this President and his party aren’t interested in hearing any lessons from Justice Ginsburg.Already, the President and his Republicans have chosen to ignore Justice Ginsburg’s final wish , to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen.A wish, by the way, shared by the American people.And it’s not complicated.The voters would simply like to have the opportunity to vote for their President before the Senate votes on a nominee.That’s not too much to ask.But President Trump and his party aren’t interested in hearing the will of the people.In fact, my sense is they’re afraid of what they’re going to be told.We are not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee in an election year.We’re not in the middle of an election year.We’re in the middle of an election.An on-going election.Almost a million Americans have already voted.More will vote this week.In just a few weeks, all Americans will have voted.But President Trump and his party don’t care.They just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can.It’s raw power.But President Trump and his party are about to learn something.They may think that it is they who have the power in this country.But they don’t.The American people have the power , you have the power.And you can make it very clear, very soon how you feel about being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination.Even worse, though, than the President and his party ignoring Justice Ginsburg’s final wish , is their determination to appoint a Justice who will undo her life’s work.Let’s be clear. The Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways.First, President Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act.And, in fact, just days after the election the court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.It’s a decision that could take away health care for 20 million Americans.It is a decision that could take away protections for preexisting conditions for more than 100 million people in our country.It’s a decision that could take away Medicare benefits for seniors.It is a decision that could toss out the rule that says children can be covered on their parents’ health care up to the age of 26.All of that will hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act.And what is especially offensive about what President Trump and his party are up to is this.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when you could charge a woman more for her health care than you can charge a man , just because she’s a woman.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when pregnancy could be considered a pre-existing condition.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take away birth control and contraceptive coverage for women.And get this.This relentless obsession with overturning the Affordable Care Act , driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama , is happening at a moment when our country is suffering through the ravages of a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.Complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could well become the next pre-existing condition.In short, there are few things they could that would be more offensive to the legacy of Justice Ginsburg than to return us to the full-scale policies of discrimination in health care toward the women of our country.But that’s what overturning the Affordable Care Act will do.And overturning the Affordable Care Act is a way a nominee gets the support of this president and his party.As Attorney General of California, I defended your right to health care.As Senator, I voted to protect your right to health care.But now President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. And we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act.Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act.As recently as 2017, she specifically attacked the Chief Justice’s opinion in an article saying, quote: “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.”If nothing else, the voters should be very clear about one thing: President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act.And they won’t stop there.They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms.Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights.There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg’s life than undoing the seminal decision in the Court’s history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body.But that’s where President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are.So let’s make it clear where we are.Let’s vote for health care. Vote for the Affordable Care Act.Vote as if your life, your choice, depends on it , because it does.Make it clear to President Trump and to every Republican Senator that if they’re determined to get rid of your health care, you’ll be just as determined to vote them out.And second, vote as if your right to vote depends on it , because it does.In 2013, the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act. Soon after, numerous states, including Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi enacted discriminatory laws designed to suppress people’s right to vote, targeting people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.” Right here in North Carolina a voter suppression law was described by a federal court as having “targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision” to deny us the right to vote. Surgical precision. After the people of Florida voted to grant formerly incarcerated citizens the right to vote, Republican officials recently enacted a modern-day poll tax to make it harder for those citizens to exercise that very right , in this upcoming election. And this modern-day poll tax was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals , in large part because of judges appointed by Donald Trump. But he knows he can’t win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak. So he is throwing up every roadblock he can to suppress the vote. And we, the people, can’t let him get away with it. Third, our ability to make a living, take care of our families, and dismantle systemic racism , well, that’s at stake, too. For example, court decisions can determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive equal pay for equal work, or collectively bargain for your rights at work.With an extra vote on the Court, Donald Trump and his party will continue their attack on laws that keep our air clean and our food and water safe , and attack any legislation that addresses climate change.They will also continue to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that still plagues our society.Their decisions could fail to hold the actors in our criminal justice system accountable.Victims of abuse of power by law enforcement could be less likely to succeed on their civil rights claims.The due process rights of criminal defendants could be less likely to be vigorously enforced.These are decisions that would upend Justice Ginsburg’s life’s work to uphold the basic civil rights of all Americans , regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or economic station. Yes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear those “Notorious RBG” t-shirts with a lot of pride. But since she passed, there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives in concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her, they could get the job of their dreams, fight for equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, serve the country they love , and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve, free of discrimination. And that legacy , her belief in all of us , is at stake. The outcome of this election, more than any other in our lifetime, affects every part of your life and every branch of government , all at once with consequences that can last generations. And all with a nation in crisis and at a crossroads. The pandemic. The recession. A reckoning on racial injustice. A changing climate. A crisis with the nomination to the Supreme Court.I know sometimes it feels like it’s all just too much for our country to take. And that’s what they want you to believe. They want you to feel tired. To feel your fight doesn’t matter. But we will not give up. And we will not give in. We won’t let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress , that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other , spread to the Supreme Court.This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate or the Supreme Court. It’s about our democracy. And, as Joe Biden has said from the moment he entered this race, it’s about the soul of our nation. Who we are. What we stand for. And maybe most importantly, who we want to be. And that’s what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the soul of our nation. And what is expected of each of us. And that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of our nation’s first Black landmarks of higher learning, established just six months after the Civil War.People born into bondage and brutality stood on this very ground as graduates and as scholars.I stand here in Estey Hall , the country’s first university hall built to educate Black women.A century later, and a few months after the Greensboro sit-ins, Ella Baker and fellow students at Shaw established the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , that our dear John Lewis would one day lead.I stand here, on their shoulders, and with all of you, as the nominee for Vice President of the United States.I stand with Joe Biden who will be your next President.I stand with Cal Cunningham who will be your next Senator from North Carolina.And I stand with them and the American people, to fight for a Supreme Court Justice, who, like Justice Ginsburg, truly believes in “Equal Justice Under Law.”May God bless Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.May God bless you all.May God bless the United States of America.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-the-future-of-the-supreme-court-89aadc32fbb9?source=user_profile---------10----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Senator Kamala Harris on the U.S. Supreme Court in Raleigh, North Carolina					Good afternoon.On Friday morning, I attended the memorial service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the U.S. Capitol.She was the first woman in our history to lie in state.I sat a few feet away from her flag-draped casket to pay my respects.It was somber and personal.And it was an extraordinary moment for me , as I'm sure it was for you and millions of Americans, and people around the world who felt a connection with her.It was sad because we lost a giant not only of the Court, but of American life.It was a celebration.Few people in our history have done more to change the lives of the American people than Ruth Bader Ginsburg did as a lawyer, an advocate, and a Supreme Court Justice.And it was an inspiration and a call to each of us.For each of us to be better, to stay in the fight , and stay committed to what motivated Justice Ginsburg the most.That phrase etched in the marble of the United States Supreme Court: 'Equal Justice Under Law.'Justice Ginsburg came to her view of the law not from a textbook, but from life.Her own life. She often told the story of how she had personally felt the sting of discrimination.As a woman.As the mother of a young child, trying to find work.And so she committed her life step by step, case by case, law by law, to tear down the obstacles in the way of so many, especially women.Now, we are about to undertake the task of finding her replacement on the United States Supreme Court.Of course, it's hard to say those words.In truth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be replaced.She was an original. A one of a kind.She combined a steel spine with an ability to extend an open hand, never a closed fist.She demonstrated you could both hold firm to your principles and still hear those with whom you disagree.That is a lesson that should be ringing in our ears.But it looks like this President and his party aren't interested in hearing any lessons from Justice Ginsburg.Already, the President and his Republicans have chosen to ignore Justice Ginsburg's final wish , to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen.A wish, by the way, shared by the American people.And it's not complicated.The voters would simply like to have the opportunity to vote for their President before the Senate votes on a nominee.That's not too much to ask.But President Trump and his party aren't interested in hearing the will of the people.In fact, my sense is they're afraid of what they're going to be told.We are not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee in an election year.We're not in the middle of an election year.We're in the middle of an election.An on-going election.Almost a million Americans have already voted.More will vote this week.In just a few weeks, all Americans will have voted.But President Trump and his party don't care.They just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can.It's raw power.But President Trump and his party are about to learn something.They may think that it is they who have the power in this country.But they don't.The American people have the power , you have the power.And you can make it very clear, very soon how you feel about being cut out of this Supreme Court nomination.Even worse, though, than the President and his party ignoring Justice Ginsburg's final wish , is their determination to appoint a Justice who will undo her life's work.Let's be clear. The Supreme Court will impact our lives in three critical ways.First, President Trump and his party have made it clear they will pick a justice who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act.And, in fact, just days after the election the court will hear a case that could strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.It's a decision that could take away health care for 20 million Americans.It is a decision that could take away protections for preexisting conditions for more than 100 million people in our country.It's a decision that could take away Medicare benefits for seniors.It is a decision that could toss out the rule that says children can be covered on their parents' health care up to the age of 26.All of that will hurt the millions of Americans who have come to rely on the Affordable Care Act.And what is especially offensive about what President Trump and his party are up to is this.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when you could charge a woman more for her health care than you can charge a man , just because she's a woman.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take us backward to a time when pregnancy could be considered a pre-existing condition.Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will take away birth control and contraceptive coverage for women.And get this.This relentless obsession with overturning the Affordable Care Act , driven entirely by a blind rage toward President Obama , is happening at a moment when our country is suffering through the ravages of a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives.Complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could well become the next pre-existing condition.In short, there are few things they could that would be more offensive to the legacy of Justice Ginsburg than to return us to the full-scale policies of discrimination in health care toward the women of our country.But that's what overturning the Affordable Care Act will do.And overturning the Affordable Care Act is a way a nominee gets the support of this president and his party.As Attorney General of California, I defended your right to health care.As Senator, I voted to protect your right to health care.But now President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. And we know where Judge Barrett stands on the Affordable Care Act.Judge Barrett is on record opposing the decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act.As recently as 2017, she specifically attacked the Chief Justice's opinion in an article saying, quote: 'Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.'If nothing else, the voters should be very clear about one thing: President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act.And they won't stop there.They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms.Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights.There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg's life than undoing the seminal decision in the Court's history that made it clear a woman has the right to control her own body.But that's where President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett are.So let's make it clear where we are.Let's vote for health care. Vote for the Affordable Care Act.Vote as if your life, your choice, depends on it , because it does.Make it clear to President Trump and to every Republican Senator that if they're determined to get rid of your health care, you'll be just as determined to vote them out.And second, vote as if your right to vote depends on it , because it does.In 2013, the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act. Soon after, numerous states, including Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi enacted discriminatory laws designed to suppress people's right to vote, targeting people of color and students. Justice Ginsburg wrote that the decision was like 'throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm.' Right here in North Carolina a voter suppression law was described by a federal court as having 'targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision' to deny us the right to vote. Surgical precision. After the people of Florida voted to grant formerly incarcerated citizens the right to vote, Republican officials recently enacted a modern-day poll tax to make it harder for those citizens to exercise that very right , in this upcoming election. And this modern-day poll tax was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals , in large part because of judges appointed by Donald Trump. But he knows he can't win if the people vote. Donald Trump is weak. So he is throwing up every roadblock he can to suppress the vote. And we, the people, can't let him get away with it. Third, our ability to make a living, take care of our families, and dismantle systemic racism , well, that's at stake, too. For example, court decisions can determine your ability to earn a living wage, to receive equal pay for equal work, or collectively bargain for your rights at work.With an extra vote on the Court, Donald Trump and his party will continue their attack on laws that keep our air clean and our food and water safe , and attack any legislation that addresses climate change.They will also continue to divide us and ignore the systemic racism that still plagues our society.Their decisions could fail to hold the actors in our criminal justice system accountable.Victims of abuse of power by law enforcement could be less likely to succeed on their civil rights claims.The due process rights of criminal defendants could be less likely to be vigorously enforced.These are decisions that would upend Justice Ginsburg's life's work to uphold the basic civil rights of all Americans , regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or economic station. Yes, she was part of our culture. Yes, we wear those 'Notorious RBG' t-shirts with a lot of pride. But since she passed, there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives in concrete yet immeasurable ways. Because of her, they could get the job of their dreams, fight for equal pay for their work, marry the person they love, serve the country they love , and enjoy the full rights and privileges of citizenship that they deserve, free of discrimination. And that legacy , her belief in all of us , is at stake. The outcome of this election, more than any other in our lifetime, affects every part of your life and every branch of government , all at once with consequences that can last generations. And all with a nation in crisis and at a crossroads. The pandemic. The recession. A reckoning on racial injustice. A changing climate. A crisis with the nomination to the Supreme Court.I know sometimes it feels like it's all just too much for our country to take. And that's what they want you to believe. They want you to feel tired. To feel your fight doesn't matter. But we will not give up. And we will not give in. We won't let the infection that President Trump has injected into the presidency and into Congress , that has paralyzed our politics and pitted Americans against each other , spread to the Supreme Court.This election is about more than the presidency or the Senate or the Supreme Court. It's about our democracy. And, as Joe Biden has said from the moment he entered this race, it's about the soul of our nation. Who we are. What we stand for. And maybe most importantly, who we want to be. And that's what I felt when I said goodbye to Justice Ginsburg. She understood the soul of our nation. And what is expected of each of us. And that belief is especially resonant at a place like Shaw University, one of our nation's first Black landmarks of higher learning, established just six months after the Civil War.People born into bondage and brutality stood on this very ground as graduates and as scholars.I stand here in Estey Hall , the country's first university hall built to educate Black women.A century later, and a few months after the Greensboro sit-ins, Ella Baker and fellow students at Shaw established the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , that our dear John Lewis would one day lead.I stand here, on their shoulders, and with all of you, as the nominee for Vice President of the United States.I stand with Joe Biden who will be your next President.I stand with Cal Cunningham who will be your next Senator from North Carolina.And I stand with them and the American people, to fight for a Supreme Court Justice, who, like Justice Ginsburg, truly believes in 'Equal Justice Under Law.'May God bless Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.May God bless you all.May God bless the United States of America.
MEKH31120209	Kamala Harris	2020-11-03	Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power	Hello Pennsylvania! Are you ready? Joe’s here. Jill’s here. Doug’s here. You are here. We are here. To bring this election home! And we’ve got one more day. This is it. Joe and I are just so grateful. For your support, your prayers, your love. For your time , volunteering, making calls. For your trust in us. And for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America. When Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. We come from different backgrounds , but we were raised, with the same values. Hard work. Honesty. Decency. A belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I’ve seen as I’ve traveled across our country over the past 84 days. The values we share as Americans. Across our country, you can feel something’s happening. In big cities and small towns , wearing masks and social distancing , I’ve seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They’re bringing their children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls, and waving the red, white and blue. The energy out there is real. It is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation , we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We’ve seen who we are. The country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow we are going to elect Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States! GOTV So, tell me, how many of you already voted? Honk if you’ve voted! Now, if you haven’t voted yet , go to IWillVote.com to find out when and where you can vote tomorrow. Honk if you’ve been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Cause we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So we can’t let up because it ain’t over till it’s over. And everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children’s futures. A woman’s right to make decisions about her own body. A criminal justice system that treats all people equally and with dignity. A Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ginsburg. That lives up to the phrase above its entrance: Equal Justice Under Law. The kind of country we want to be. It’s all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes , and the decision we make will last for generations. And as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone’s mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was. That it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looked straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th what he knew? Can you imagine how your family might have been able to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare? But President Trump doesn’t think about what’s best for America. He only thinks about what’s best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230 thousand lives to COVID. So many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230 thousand Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War Two. In addition, we’re looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus. And we know it’s hitting communities of color hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at 3 times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at 2 times the rate of others. And let’s be clear. We are also in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression because President Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. 1 in 5 mothers with children under the age of 12 describe them as hungry. 1 in 6 households are behind on rent. 1 in 4 small businesses have closed. And yet, 9 months into this pandemic, this president still doesn’t have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America’s history. And on top of it all, President Trump is in court right now trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He’s trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know someone with asthma, diabetes, breast cancer. America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. The first thing Joe and I will do when we’re in the White House is get this virus under control. We’ll listen to the scientists and public health experts. Provide free testing, treatment and when it’s available, a safe vaccine for all. Provide schools with the guidance and resources they need to reopen safely. And we will build back an economy that actually works for working people. And let me be clear: Joe and I will not increase taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Period. But we will, ask the super wealthy and biggest corporations to pay their fair share. And we’ll invest those tax dollars to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure. Tackle the climate crisis and create millions of good-paying union jobs. Make child care more affordable and invest in our nation’s schools and teachers. Build on Obamacare and expand access to health care to tens of millions of Americans, including mental health care. Lower prescription drug costs. Protect and expand Medicare and Social Security. We’ll work to root out the systemic racism that still exists in our criminal justice system. Confront white supremacy. And fight for economic justice , no matter your zip code or race. And we’ll begin the work of healing, repairing, and uniting our nation , Democrats. Republicans. And Independents. People of all races and backgrounds. Because that’s how we’ve always overcome our greatest challenges. Together. And Joe gets that. You see, Joe is a leader who understands what the American people are going through. He sees us. He understands suffering because he has experienced it himself. Joe Biden is a leader of both strength and empathy. Toughness and humility. He understands that the measure of a person’s strength is not based on who you put down, but who you lift up. And he knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter our race or gender, background or faith; no matter how we identify or who we love; no matter the language your grandmother speaks; what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us. That’s the kind of leader America needs right now. And it’s why we must win this election. So remember this:Your vote is your voice, and your voice is your power. Don’t let anyone take away your power. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to speak out. And now is the time to vote. Vote like our lives depend on it. Because they do. Vote like our democracy depends on it. Because it does. Vote like justice, equality, and opportunity , decency, character, and dignity , are on the ballot. Because they are. One day, our children and grandchildren are going to look us in the eye and ask what we did in this moment. And I want to be able to say, we did everything we could to fight for our country and their future. So, let’s do that. Let’s vote. With conviction. Confidence. And hope. And let’s elect Joe Biden the next President of the United States! Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless America.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/your-vote-is-your-voice-and-your-voice-is-your-power-39ad3afac9ff?source=user_profile---------9----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Senator Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania					Hello Pennsylvania!

MEKH81120208	Kamala Harris	2020-11-08	America is ready. And so are Joe and I.	Good evening.Congressman John Lewis, before his passing, wrote: “Democracy is not a state. It is an act.”And what he meant was that America’s democracy is not guaranteed.It is only as strong as our willingness to fight for it, to guard it and never take it for granted.And protecting our democracy takes struggle.It takes sacrifice. There is joy in it and there is progress.Because We The People have the power to build a better future.And when our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America.To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team , thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible.To the poll workers and election officials across our country who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted , our nation owes you a debt of gratitude as you have protected the integrity of our democracy.And to the American people who make up our beautiful country , thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard.I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months.The grief, sorrow, and pain. The worries and the struggles.But we’ve also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit.For 4 years, you marched and organized for equality and justice, for our lives, and for our planet.And then, you voted. You delivered a clear message.You chose hope, unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth.You chose Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America.Joe is a healer. A uniter. A tested and steady hand.A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.And a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady.It’s his love for Hunter, Ashley, his grandchildren, and the entire Biden family.And while I first knew Joe as Vice President, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend, who we remember here today.To my husband Doug, our children Cole and Ella, my sister Maya, and our whole family , I love you all more than I can express.We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey.And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today , my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts.When she came here from India at the age of 19, maybe she didn’t quite imagine this moment.But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.So, I’m thinking about her and about the generations of women , Black Women.Asian, White, Latina, and Native American women throughout our nation’s history who have paved the way for this moment tonight.Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty, and justice for all, including the Black women, who are too often overlooked, but so often Prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.All the Women who worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century: 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now, in 2020, with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continued the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard.Tonight, I reflect on their struggle, their determination and the strength of their vision , to see what can be unburdened by what has been , I stand on their shoulders.And what a testament it is to Joe’s character that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his Vice President.But while I may be the first woman in this office, I won’t be the last.Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message:Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they’ve never seen it before.And we will applaud you every step of the way.To the American people:No matter who you voted for, I will strive to be the Vice President that Joe was to President Obama , loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your families. Because now is when the real work begins.The Hard work. The Necessary work. The Good work.The essential work to save lives and beat this pandemic.To rebuild our economy so it works for working people.To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society.To combat the climate crisis.To unite our country and heal the soul of our nation.The road ahead will not be easy.But America is ready.

There is joy in it and there is progress.Because We The People have the power to build a better future.And when our very democracy was on the ballot in this election, with the very soul of America at stake, and the world watching, you ushered in a new day for America.To our campaign staff and volunteers, this extraordinary team , thank you for bringing more people than ever before into the democratic process and for making this victory possible.To the poll workers and election officials across our country who have worked tirelessly to make sure every vote is counted , our nation owes you a debt of gratitude as you have protected the integrity of our democracy.And to the American people who make up our beautiful country , thank you for turning out in record numbers to make your voices heard.I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months.The grief, sorrow, and pain. The worries and the struggles.But we've also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit.For 4 years, you marched and organized for equality and justice, for our lives, and for our planet.And then, you voted. You delivered a clear message.You chose hope, unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth.You chose Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America.Joe is a healer. A uniter. A tested and steady hand.A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.And a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.It's his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady.It's his love for Hunter, Ashley, his grandchildren, and the entire Biden family.And while I first knew Joe as Vice President, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend, who we remember here today.To my husband Doug, our children Cole and Ella, my sister Maya, and our whole family , I love you all more than I can express.We are so grateful to Joe and Jill for welcoming our family into theirs on this incredible journey.And to the woman most responsible for my presence here today , my mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who is always in our hearts.When she came here from India at the age of 19, maybe she didn't quite imagine this moment.But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible.So, I'm thinking about her and about the generations of women , Black Women.Asian, White, Latina, and Native American women throughout our nation's history who have paved the way for this moment tonight.Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty, and justice for all, including the Black women, who are too often overlooked, but so often Prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.All the Women who worked to secure and protect the right to vote for over a century: 100 years ago with the 19th Amendment, 55 years ago with the Voting Rights Act, and now, in 2020, with a new generation of women in our country who cast their ballots and continued the fight for their fundamental right to vote and be heard.Tonight, I reflect on their struggle, their determination and the strength of their vision , to see what can be unburdened by what has been , I stand on their shoulders.And what a testament it is to Joe's character that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his Vice President.But while I may be the first woman in this office, I won't be the last.Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message:Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they've never seen it before.And we will applaud you every step of the way.To the American people:No matter who you voted for, I will strive to be the Vice President that Joe was to President Obama , loyal, honest, and prepared, waking up every day thinking of you and your families. Because now is when the real work begins.The Hard work. The Necessary work. The Good work.The essential work to save lives and beat this pandemic.To rebuild our economy so it works for working people.To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society.To combat the climate crisis.To unite our country and heal the soul of our nation.The road ahead will not be easy.But America is ready. And so are Joe and I.We have elected a president who represents the best in us.A leader the world will respect and our children can look up to.A Commander in Chief who will respect our troops and keep our country safe.And a President for all Americans.It is now my great honor to introduce the President-elect of the United States of America, Joe Biden.

No matter what.A President who will be focused on one thing and one thing only: doing what’s best for The People of the United States of America.When Joe asked me to be his running mate, he told me about his commitment to making sure we selected a cabinet that looks like America , that reflects the very best of our nation.That is what we have done.Today’s nominees and appointees come from different places. They bring a range of different life and professional experiences and perspectives. And they also share something else in common: an unwavering belief in America’s ideals.An unshakeable commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.And they understand the indispensable role of America’s leadership in the world.These women and men are patriots and public servants to their core, and they are the leaders we need to meet the challenges of this moment , and those that lie ahead.Thank you.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/advancing-our-leadership-around-the-world-b24a080313c3?source=user_profile---------7----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					Thank you, Secretary Kerry.And congratulations Mr. President-elect on bringing together this extraordinary team.I have always believed in the nobility of public service, and these Americans embody it.Their lives and careers are a testament to the dedication, sacrifice, and commitment to civic responsibility that have strengthened our democracy , and kept America's promise alive , for more than two hundred years.President-elect Biden and I have long known that when we were elected, we would inherit a series of unprecedented challenges upon walking into the White House.Addressing these challenges starts with getting this pandemic under control, opening our economy responsibly, and making sure it works for working people.And we also know that overcoming our challenges here at home is a necessary foundation for restoring and advancing our leadership around the world.And we are ready for that work.We will need to reassemble and renew America's alliances; rebuild and strengthen the national security and foreign policy institutions that keep us safe and advance our nation's interests; and confront and combat the existential threat of climate change that endangers us all.I take these issues very seriously.My whole career has been about keeping people safe, from serving as District Attorney to California's Attorney General to the United States Senate, where I have served on the Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees.I have come to know firsthand the gravity of the challenges and threats facing the United States.And, over the past few months, I have also come to know the sound judgment, expertise, and character of the people on this stage.I can say with confidence that they are , to a person , the right women and men for these critical positions.And I look forward to working alongside them on behalf of the American people , and on behalf of a President who will ask tough questions; demand that we be guided by facts; and expect our team to speak the truth.

An America where opportunity is within reach for everyone. For all The People.So, we’ve got a lot of work to do, to build that America.And President-elect Biden and I, with this economic team, will be ready to hit the ground running on day one.Because that’s what this crisis demands.And that’s what the American people deserve.Thank you.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/our-outstanding-economic-team-58113fbade0e?source=user_profile---------6----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					Mr. President-elect, congratulations on choosing this outstanding economic team.And to our nominees and appointees, thank you for your continued service to our nation.This is the team we need to deliver immediate economic relief to the American people, to get our economy back on track, and to make sure it works for working people.And, as President-elect Biden noted earlier, completing that task could not be more urgent.Cases of COVID-19 are spiking.And beyond the tragic loss of life, the toll of this recession continues to mount.Across America, one in six adults with children say their families are hungry; one in three adults are having trouble paying their bills; and the number of open small businesses has fallen by nearly 30 percent due to this pandemic, while many others are hoping they can stay afloat until a vaccine is available.These are the struggles , the worries , that keep people up in the middle of the night.But Americans are not united by their worries alone.They're united by their aspirations , for themselves and their families.Because no matter where you live or what language your grandmother speaks, everyone wants to be able to get a job and keep a job.No matter what your gender or who you love, everyone wants to be able to buy a home and keep a home.And no matter how you worship or who you voted for in this election, everyone wants to be able to give their children a decent education, even during a pandemic.Joe and I understand that.We were raised to respect the dignity of work.That's why I've always fought for working people , from standing up for middle class families who'd lost their homes in the Great Recession to joining picket lines to advance workers' rights.And I look forward to collaborating with this extraordinary team to put working people front and center in this administration.These public servants are some of America's most brilliant minds.They are proven leaders, whose talents, achievements, and life stories reflect the very best of our country.And they not only have the experience and expertise to help end this economic crisis and put people back to work, they also share our commitment to building an economy , an America , where everyone has access to a higher minimum wage and affordable health care.Paid family leave and paid sick leave.Homeownership, and capital to start a small business.

MEKH91220205	Kamala Harris	2020-12-09	The team to get this pandemic under control	Congratulations Mr. President-elect on nominating and appointing this outstanding team to get this pandemic under control.And thank you to these accomplished physicians, experts, and public servants for answering the call to serve the American people in this hour of need.Over Thanksgiving, the president-elect and I called health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic. Just to thank them.We wanted to express our gratitude , and our nation’s gratitude , for everything they have been doing. For every sacrifice they have made.That day, I spoke with a registered nurse named Maureen in Pennsylvania and Talisa in Illinois.They shared stories we’ve all heard.We’ve all heard the stories about grandmothers and grandfathers, loved ones and friends spending their last moments alone.We’ve all heard about nurses and physicians who are physically and mentally exhausted trying to keep up with ever-increasing caseloads. Those on the frontline who say to each other, it’s a matter of when, not if, they get the virus.We’ve all heard about health care workers without the supplies and equipment they need to care for patients and save lives.So, today, we have a message for Talisa, Maureen, and all Americans: help is on the way.And it’s long overdue.The scale of this pandemic is heartbreaking.Almost 15 million cases. More than 2,800 deaths. In a single day.And then, there’s the economic devastation. The lost jobs. The small businesses shuttered.Not to mention what’s happening to our schools. The parents and teachers who are being stretched to their limits. And the toll it’s all taking on the mental health and well-being of our children who risk falling behind.Opening our schools and economy safely and responsibly, getting this virus under control , all of it starts with listening to experts and leaders like these; Americans who reflect the very best of our nation.They are top physicians, public health experts, and public servants.And they are the team the American people need and deserve.To make sure testing and treatment are free for everyone. To make sure vaccines are safe, free, and equitably distributed.To make sure we are better prepared for future pandemics and other health threats.And to make sure quality, affordable health care is available to all.From an early age, I saw the lifesaving work that our health care professionals provide, especially for the most vulnerable among us. You see, my mother was a breast cancer researcher, and my sister and I spent many hours roaming the halls of the hospital where she worked.It’s why I co-founded an auxiliary group to help patients at the county hospital in Oakland more than twenty years ago.It’s why we need to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act.And it’s why we have to listen to frontline health care workers like Maureen and Talisa.During our conversation, Talisa said:“We wouldn’t send our soldiers to battle without the gear they need. And we shouldn’t send our doctors and nurses to fight this pandemic without the gear they need.”She is right.And President-elect Biden and I , along with this world-class team , will make sure we are doing everything we can, to save lives and contain this pandemic once and for all.Getting this virus under control is one of the defining challenges of our time.And we will do what the American people have always done in the face of a great challenge.We will stand together and defeat it.Thank you.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/the-outstanding-team-to-get-this-pandemic-under-control-b3ee48d7b83a?source=user_profile---------5----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					Congratulations Mr. President-elect on nominating and appointing this outstanding team to get this pandemic under control.And thank you to these accomplished physicians, experts, and public servants for answering the call to serve the American people in this hour of need.Over Thanksgiving, the president-elect and I called health care workers who are on the front lines of this pandemic.

I know them well. And some are dear friends.These leaders have different backgrounds and lived experiences. They bring to their roles different skills, perspectives, and areas of expertise.And they all reflect the very best of our nation.They are all dedicated and compassionate public servants, and all of them are ready to hit the ground running on day one.So, congratulations Mr. President-elect on these outstanding choices.I look forward to working with you , and the team we are bringing together , to meet the urgent challenges facing our nation, and rebuild our country in a way that lifts up all Americans.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/the-team-we-are-bringing-together-ec5bd778b1a5?source=user_profile---------3----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					Good afternoon.Over these past few days and weeks, we have announced members of our administration, who will help us meet the unprecedented challenges facing the American people.We have brought together a health care team that will help contain this pandemic once and for all, an economic team that will help build an economy that works for working people, and all those looking to work, and a national security and foreign policy team that will help keep our nation safe, and restore and advance our leadership around the world.Today, we are announcing leaders who will help deliver immediate relief to every corner of our great country, from rural communities to big cities and every place in between, leaders who will help care for our veterans and their families, and advance opportunity for all Americans at this consequential moment for our country.At a time when one in eight households say they didn't have enough money for food in the past week, we need leaders who understand that no one should go hungry in the United States of America.At a time when one in six renters are behind on rent, we need leaders who will not only help provide relief to all who need it, but help address the affordable housing crisis in America.I was in high school by the time my mother saved up enough to put a down payment on a home.So, I understand the dignity of homeownership, and the importance of making the American dream a reality for everyone.At a time when veterans, including those I've represented in California, have been strained by almost two decades of war and economic hardship, we need leaders who will treat all who've worn our nation's uniform, and their families, with the dignity and respect they have earned.Leaders who will be focused on doing what's in the best interests of the American people, who will negotiate trade deals that are good for workers and good for our economy, who will address the defining challenges of our time , from combatting our climate crisis to advancing racial justice.That is what these remarkable Americans will do.

MEKH171220202	Kamala Harris	2020-12-17	A safe, modern, and sustainable transportation system	As President-elect Biden and I look ahead to the challenges we will inherit upon walking into the White House, we are focused on containing this pandemic and delivering relief to all who need it.We are focused on safely reopening our schools and responsibly reopening our economy.And, as we’ve said many times, we are also focused on building America back better and doing what is necessary to lift up all Americans no matter where they live , whether it’s in big cities, rural areas, or anyplace in between.One of the most important ways we will do that is by creating good, union jobs to build, operate, and maintain a safe, modern, and sustainable transportation system.A transportation system that will help us grow our economy, tackle our climate crisis, and connect all Americans to jobs and opportunity.We will transform our roads and bridges, transit systems, railways, ports, and airports, while powering them with clean energy.Spark a renaissance in American passenger rail that will not only connect our country, but unlock job-creation and growth across our manufacturing sector.And we will expand and upgrade our transportation system in a way that’s equitable. Serving communities of every size , urban and rural , all across our country.The choice President-elect Biden has made to help spearhead this work is simply outstanding.I got to know Pete over the last two years.We traveled to the same states, attended the same events, and shared a debate stage many times.We’ve had long conversations, he and I , about the future of our country, about the need for bipartisanship, and about family and faith.And along the way, Pete and his wonderful husband, Chasten, have become very dear friends of Doug’s and mine.Pete is an innovative problem solver. He has a sharp intellect and a deep commitment to uniting people across party lines and meeting our challenges together.He is a trailblazing leader from the industrial Midwest who understands that we need to create opportunity for people of all backgrounds.And he is a veteran and dedicated public servant who represents the very best of our country and the next generation of American leadership.Now, Pete will bring his remarkable talents to bear , not just on behalf of the people of South Bend, but on behalf of people across our nation.In 1966, upon creating the Department of Transportation, President Lyndon Johnson said, “America’s history is a history of her transportation.”With Pete’s leadership, we are ready to write the next great chapter in that history, modernizing our infrastructure, creating jobs and opportunity, and helping to usher in a clean energy future for the United States of America.Thank you, Mr. President-elect and welcome Pete.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/a-safe-modern-and-sustainable-transportation-system-fef82b3dae54?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------	Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					As President-elect Biden and I look ahead to the challenges we will inherit upon walking into the White House, we are focused on containing this pandemic and delivering relief to all who need it.We are focused on safely reopening our schools and responsibly reopening our economy.And, as we've said many times, we are also focused on building America back better and doing what is necessary to lift up all Americans no matter where they live , whether it's in big cities, rural areas, or anyplace in between.One of the most important ways we will do that is by creating good, union jobs to build, operate, and maintain a safe, modern, and sustainable transportation system.A transportation system that will help us grow our economy, tackle our climate crisis, and connect all Americans to jobs and opportunity.We will transform our roads and bridges, transit systems, railways, ports, and airports, while powering them with clean energy.Spark a renaissance in American passenger rail that will not only connect our country, but unlock job-creation and growth across our manufacturing sector.And we will expand and upgrade our transportation system in a way that's equitable.

MEKH8120211	Kamala Harris	2021-01-08	Restoring integrity and independence to the Justice Department	One of the fundamental principles upon which America’s democracy rests , a principle as sacred as a civic value can be , is fidelity to the rule of law.In times of stability, that principle can seem abstract, like something out of a legal textbook that isn’t relevant to our daily lives.But in times of upheaval, we come to realize, to appreciate, just how vital the rule of law truly is.What we saw yesterday in our nation’s capital was, as the President-elect called it, an assault on the rule of law.And it has no place in our democracy.So, we must ask ourselves two questions about what happened yesterday: “What went wrong?” and “How do we make it right?” And I believe the answers require us to recognize that the challenge we’re facing in our country is about more than the actions of a few. It’s about how to reform, how to transform a justice system that doesn’t work equally for all. A justice system that’s experienced differently if you’re white or Black. A justice system that’s experienced differently if you’re rich or poor. A justice system that’s different if your job requires you to take a shower before you go to work or requires you to take a shower when you come home after work. We witnessed two systems of justice when we saw one that let extremists storm the U.S. Capitol and another that released tear gas on peaceful protestors last summer.The American people have expressed outrage.We know this is unacceptable.We know we should be better than this.The promise of our country is that all people will be treated equally.That’s what the rule of law is supposed to be about.That’s what the ideal of “Equal Justice Under Law” is all about.I’ve dedicated my career to helping uphold those principles, to helping build a more just and equal America , whether as San Francisco’s District Attorney or California’s Attorney General, or United States Senator.And that’s what I will do as Vice President.The public servants we are announcing today have also dedicated themselves to building a more just and equal America.And the roles they will assume are some of the most important in our country, especially right now.They will be responsible for pursuing justice and ensuring that all Americans are treated equally.They will be the guardians of our justice system.They will have the power to enforce our laws in a more fair and more humane manner, while also holding those who violate the law accountable , whether ordinary citizens or law enforcement.They will help protect the rights of every voter in our country, no matter what their background or where they live.And they will restore integrity and independence to the Justice Department and rebuild the American people’s trust in the institution.I know they will do this.Because these nominees have the experience, judgment, and moral compass that these roles demand, as well as an abiding commitment to supporting and defending the Constitution of the United States.For many centuries, the ideal of justice has been symbolized as a woman, blindfolded, with a scale in her hands.There is a reason the eyes of Lady Justice are covered.It’s because justice shouldn’t depend on the color of your skin or how much money you have in your bank account.It shouldn’t depend on what language your grandmother speaks or what political party you belong to.Justice should be impartial.It should be fair.It should be applied equally.And President-elect Biden and I, along with this superb team, will help make sure it is, while restoring and strengthening the rule of law that always has been and always will be the bedrock of America’s democracy.Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/restoring-integrity-and-independence-to-the-justice-department-ee3e2b3bd859?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------	Remarks Announcing Department of Justice Leadership as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					One of the fundamental principles upon which America's democracy rests , a principle as sacred as a civic value can be , is fidelity to the rule of law.In times of stability, that principle can seem abstract, like something out of a legal textbook that isn't relevant to our daily lives.But in times of upheaval, we come to realize, to appreciate, just how vital the rule of law truly is.What we saw yesterday in our nation's capital was, as the President-elect called it, an assault on the rule of law.And it has no place in our democracy.So, we must ask ourselves two questions about what happened yesterday: 'What went wrong?' and 'How do we make it right?'

MEKH9120210	Kamala Harris	2021-01-09	Building an economy that’s stronger and fairer for working people	One of the fundamental values that President-elect Biden and I share is a belief in the dignity of work.We both understand that a job is about more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity and respect.Joe learned that lesson from his father. I learned it from my mother.My mother taught me in her words and her actions, that no matter how you earn a living, whether you’re a caregiver or truck driver, grocery store clerk or small business owner, every job has inherent value and worth.And every worker, everywhere, has a right to earn a living wage, work in safe and healthy conditions, and pursue a better life for themselves and their family.We also know that right now, the dignity of an honest day’s work, and the financial stability of a steady income , are out of reach for millions of Americans.The December jobs report makes that very clear.Food banks are being strained trying to feed people who’ve had to worry, for the first time in their lives, about where to go for their next meal.Essential workers, like the nurses Joe and I called over the holidays, continue to risk their own health and the health of their families for all of us.Small business owners, from restaurants to barber shops to dry cleaners, are hurting.And let’s be clear: those who run America’s small businesses aren’t just business leaders, they’re civic leaders and community leaders. They’re the ones who sponsor Little League games, scholarships, and all kinds of local causes and activities.And we must do right by them.So, first and foremost, as the President-elect has said, we need to provide more immediate relief for working families and businesses , now.And even as we address our immediate crises, even as we work to contain this pandemic and open our economy responsibly, we must also do what President-elect Biden and I have pledged to do:We must build our economy back better.So it lifts up everyone, no matter what you do for a living or where you live, whether it’s in small towns, big cities, or anyplace in between.That means providing access to capital for small business owners , the economic engines of our neighborhoods , so they can create jobs and help our communities thrive.It means making sure we’re equipping workers with the skills they’ll need for the jobs of the future, and making sure our entrepreneurs and businesses continue to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world.And it means protecting and expanding workers’ rights by fighting for a higher minimum wage and paid leave, safe and healthy workplaces and stronger unions.From working with unions as San Francisco’s District Attorney, to helping author the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights in the U.S. Senate, I can tell you from personal experience, that whether it’s the apprenticeships of the building trades, or the caregiving skills of home health care workers, this is some of the most important work being done in our country.The President-elect and I know that.And so does the team we are announcing today.These leaders, together with the rest of our economic team, will help create millions of good-paying, union jobs, and build an economy that’s stronger, and fairer for working people.They are seasoned public servants with track records of not only standing up for workers and unions, but spurring innovation, and creating opportunity for small business owners.And like President-elect Biden and I, they will fight to honor the dignity of work.The President-elect and I share a vision of America where opportunity is within reach for all The People.Where everyone can see a brighter future for themselves and their children.With the leadership of these public servants and our entire economic team, we will get to work building that America less than two weeks from today.Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	https://kamalaharris.medium.com/building-an-economy-thats-stronger-and-fairer-for-working-people-3ef9f0693fd6?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------	Remarks Announcing Labor, Commerce, and SBA Nominations as Prepared for Delivery by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in Wilmington, Delaware					One of the fundamental values that President-elect Biden and I share is a belief in the dignity of work.We both understand that a job is about more than a paycheck.
