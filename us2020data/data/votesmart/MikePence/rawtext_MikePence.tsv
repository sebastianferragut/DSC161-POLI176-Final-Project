VSMP111201922	Mike Pence	2019-01-11	Remarks by Vice President Pence Before Meet-and-Greet with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Employees	statement	"Well, thank you, Secretary Nielsen. Thank you for your great leadership. The Department of Homeland Security; to Commissioner McAleenan, who is with us today; and to Chief Carla Provost , we just couldn't be more proud of your leadership or all of the great men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Would you join me in thanking Carla for her outstanding leadership? (Applause.) It's an honor to be with you today, with all the men and women who represent some 60,000 employees all across this country, public servants all , the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. And it is a privilege to be able to address you at this momentous time. And let me bring greetings from a great champion of the U.S. Border Patrol and all of the men and women and all of the agencies in U.S. Customs and Border Protection. I want to bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. As the President said yesterday, and I say again today travelling all across this country, in his words, ""You have no idea how much you are loved by the American people."" As the President said many times, ""a country without borders is not a country."" And each and every day, the men and women of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol see to the territorial integrity of the United States of America. And every American is grateful for the service and sacrifice that each one of you provide to this country each and every day. We're grateful for the work that you do. And let me assure you that, in a challenging time, in the midst of a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border, on behalf of the President, myself, and our entire administration, I am here to say we are with you and we are going to continue to stand with you until you have the resources and the reforms to do your job. That's my pledge. The men and women of CBP do an essential job for the national security of the United States. It's amazing to think this is one of the largest law enforcement organizations in the world. Each of you makes an extraordinary difference. And the truth of the matter is, men and women of this department, you risk your lives every day to enforce the laws of this country, but you also save lives every day. And in the midst of this extraordinary humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border, the numbers speak for themselves about your commitment to law and order, but also your commitment to demonstrate the compassion of the American people. Now, while some in the public debate say that this is a ""manufactured crisis"" on the southern border, I expect the men and women in uniform gathered here and those that might be looking on know the truth of it. I mean, the reality is, today, we've got nearly 60,000 people attempting to come into our country illegally every single month. And for the first time ever, driven largely by smugglers and cartels and human traffickers, 60 percent of those apprehended now are families and children. It's putting, as you all know, an extraordinary burden on our U.S. Border Patrol and on Customs and Border Protection. Newly released data shows that December was actually a record-breaking month for family units apprehended at our border: 27,500 family units were apprehended illegally crossing the border in the last month. It's placed an incredible burden on our system and it represents, literally, 136 percent increase from 2017 alone. Now, there's been some confusion among this, and some of it actually has been fairly innocent, in my view. I've talked to some elected officials who had the impression that illegal immigration on our southern border was down. And, frankly, because of the efforts of U.S. Border Patrol, individuals attempting to come into our country are being apprehended and are being prosecuted in a manner that that number has been declining in recent months. But what you all know is we've seen a dramatic increase in the number of families, in the number of unaccompanied children. In fact, there are 10,000 , there were 10,000 more members of families and unaccompanied children in the last month than when President Obama called it a humanitarian crisis in the Rose Garden in 2014. Let me say that again: In the last month, we saw more than 10,000 families and unaccompanied children attempt to come across our border , that was 10,000 more than when President Obama called it a humanitarian crisis in the Rose Garden in 2014. Well, he was right then, and President Trump is right now. We have a humanitarian crisis on our southern border and it demands action by the Congress. And the President, and I, and our entire administration are going to continue to stand strong until we give you the resources and the reforms that you need to accomplish your mission. Let me also say it's not simply a humanitarian crisis. We recognize that each one of you risk your lives every day enforcing our laws. Gangs like MS-13 use our weak borders to gain entry into our country and they target unaccompanied minors for recruitment. We know heartbreakingly that 300 Americans lose their lives every week to heroin overdose and addiction, and that 90 percent of heroin enters our country through our southern border. We know the scourge of human trafficking , that 70 percent of migrants are victims of violence on their journey north. Thirty percent of women, according to Doctors Without Borders report being sexually assaulted during the journey north. It is remarkable to think, in the last year alone, U.S. Border Patrol and our border officials apprehended 17,000 individuals with prior criminal convictions attempting to come illegally into the United States of America. We have a humanitarian crisis at our border, we have a security crisis at our border. And each one of you are on the frontlines of standing in the gap and enforcing our laws. And you have our gratitude. Let me also say, I was deeply moved to hear about the efforts of emergency medical technicians. I mean, it is remarkable to think that those of you wearing the blue and green uniforms out enforcing our laws on our borders have also been in the lifesaving business. I just learned that since December 22nd, you've escorted 48 individuals to the hospital per day. And again, this is a reflection of the vulnerable nature of the population that's coming to our border, being exploited by human traffickers and cartels and smugglers. It's amazing to think that in the last year, 12,000 were referred for hospital visits by U.S. Border Patrol, but we're on track this year for 28,000 hospital referrals. Now, that's a demonstration of the compassion of the American people. Our hearts broke when we all learned of the loss of life of two young Guatemalan children who were presented at our border very ill. But the American people should know: 48 hospital trips per day, now on track 28,000. And again, it's a reflection of the families and the unaccompanied minors and their families that are being taken advantage of by those who would profit , more than $2 billion estimated in the last year , from human trafficking and smuggling. So it's a challenging time on our border, but I know you all have risen to the challenge and you're all about the mission. And I really came here to assure you of our support, but also to thank you. Thank you for staying focused on the mission even in these challenging times. And also to say to each one of you, on behalf of the President of the United States, everyone in Customs and Border Protection, that just as you fight every day to keep our nation safe, this President and this administration will keep fighting to build the wall and give you the resources and reforms you need to do your job. That's my promise. (Applause.) We do it because it's the right thing to do. We do it because the facts of what's happening on our southern border speak for themselves. But I also know that we do this in the midst of a partial government shutdown that has no doubt created anxiety for families that are gathered here today. And I want to assure you and your families that, at President Trump's direction, we've taken steps to mitigate the impact of this partial government shutdown on you, on your families, and on the some-800,000 federal workers that are affected. We've made sure that tax refunds will be going out on schedule. We've made sure that food stamp benefits will go forward. And I'm also pleased to report to you that, with the full support of the President of the United States, just moments ago the House of Representatives passed legislation that will ensure that all the dedicated professionals at Customs and Border Protection and all of the agencies affected by this shutdown will be paid in full when the government reopens. Your families will get your paychecks. We're going to continue to work to end this shutdown. But I promise you, we're going to continue to stand to give you the resources and the infrastructure that you tell us you need to do your job. And I want to thank all of you for staying on mission and I want to thank you for your support. When I was putting my notes together to come over today, I came across a note from some members of the team down in Tucson. They sent me a note pointing out that, while fellow agents who are going to be impacted in their paychecks on a day like today, they still wanted me to know, and I quote, ""We believe in what the President is doing and we're behind you 100 percent."" Now, that's a voice of a public servant. That's someone who has responded to a calling to advance a mission. And I know all of you standing here today , and I can tell by the looks on your faces , share that same sentiment. I mean, the truth of the matter is, as the President visited McAllen, Texas yesterday at the border, he acknowledged then, I acknowledge now, you're incredible people, but we know you need help. We know we need a wall. We need a physical barrier in areas of our southern border. We know you need additional resources to meet the security and humanitarian challenges that you face with this rising tide of illegal immigration so much comprised of families and unaccompanied minors, different than in days past. And we know you need reforms in the law that will take the enticements that human traffickers use to encourage families to take the long and dangerous journey up the peninsula to attempt to come into our country illegally. And we're going to continue to fight for all of those reforms. But in the midst of it, my word to each and every one of you is: Focus on the mission. I know here at U.S. Customs and Border Protection you are all about the mission. And it is a long and storied tradition here. And I want to assure you that we're going to figure this thing out. The President wanted me to communicate to each and every one of you, we're going to get you the support that you need. We're going to build that wall. We're going to get the resources that you need to secure our border one way or another. That's our pledge to each and every one of you. We owe you nothing less, and more importantly, we owe the American people nothing less. But in the meantime, just keep doing what you do every day. Just keep making the American people proud, just every bit as much as you make your families proud. And keep that incredible, heroic tradition of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. You know, there's a verse in the Bible that says we're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses. And as I came in today, I stopped for a minute to stop at the memorial of your silent partners at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It's amazing to think, in the nearly 95-year history of this agency, 127 have fallen in the line of duty. Fallen to protect the territorial integrity of the United States and to protect the American people. You are a part of a long and proud tradition, and I promise you this President, his Vice President, our administration, the American people are with you. We are going to stand with you and give you the resources and reforms you need to accomplish your mission. So, thank you. God bless you, and keep up the great work. It's an honor to be with you all. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1315235/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-before-meet-and-greet-with-us-customs-and-border-patrol-employees&speechType=6	National Security Government Operations Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-meet-greet-u-s-customs-border-patrol-employees/
VSMP161201921	Mike Pence	2019-01-16	Statement by Vice President Mike Pence on the terrorist attack in Syria	statement	President Trump and I condemn the terrorist attack in Syria that claimed American lives and our hearts are with the loved ones of the fallen. We honor their memory and we will never forget their service and sacrifice. Thanks to the courage of our Armed Forces, we have crushed the ISIS caliphate and devastated its capabilities. As we begin to bring our troops home, the American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families, and our nation, we will never allow the remnants of ISIS to reestablish their evil and murderous caliphate , not now, not ever.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1316197/statement-by-vice-president-mike-pence-on-the-terrorist-attack-in-syria&speechType=6	Defense Foreign Affairs			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-vice-president-mike-pence-terrorist-attack-syria/
VSMP3112019117	Mike Pence	2019-01-31	Remarks by Vice President Pence at DEA Employee Engagement Event	speech	"Thank you all. I want to thank the Acting Administrator for his great leadership of this agency, and for his service and his words today. And to the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, thank you for your service to the people of the United States. Would you join me in thanking these two great leaders for all they do for the American people? (Applause.) It's an honor to be with all of you today and with these great leaders and all those you represent , some 10,000 law enforcement personnel not just around America, but around the world who are working every day to protect American families and defend this nation from the scourge of drug abuse, addiction, and the crime and syndicates and violence associated with it. It is an honor to be at the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) And it's a privilege to be able to come here today to receive a briefing from your senior leadership about the status of our efforts, in this hemisphere and around the world, in combatting drug abuse and addiction. And before I get started, let me bring greetings from a great champion of law enforcement, a great champion of this agency, and someone who works every day to make sure you have the resources and the support that you need to protect the American people , I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) As the President said not long ago, ""there is nobody that deserves respect more than"" the men and women of law enforcement. And I see that everywhere he travels around this country. And I can see, on your faces, gathered here today, that you know you have a President, you have an entire administration that appreciates the work that you do defending the American people. And I'm really here today not just to learn more about the important work of this agency that each one of you do every day, here and around the country and around the world, but really also just to say thank you, to pay a debt of gratitude to each and every one of you for the efforts that you make on behalf of America's families. It's amazing to think that, every day, men and women of the DEA serve on the frontlines of law enforcement here at home and in 69 other countries around the world, oftentimes risking your lives to protect the American people from deadly drugs and the criminal organizations that profit from trafficking it in our country. I can assure you that every American is grateful for the careers represented in this room and for the efforts of the men and women who are gathered here. As I sat at the briefing table, just a few moments ago, I asked all the senior leadership to tell me how many years they'd been at the DEA. And only six of them spoke, and I counted up 200 years. (Laughter.) Would you give yourselves another round of applause for the long record of service that each of you have provided? (Applause.) I could tell from them and I can tell from all of you that you know this is a calling. It's a calling to serve and protect the American people here at the DEA. And thanks to all of you for the many, many years you've invested in that. And I want to assure you: This President has your back. From the first month after taking office, the President signed an executive order to strengthen the authority of the DEA and law enforcement at every level to combat transnational criminal organizations, drug cartels, and gangs that threaten the American people. The President also signed into law a historic opioid bill that gives the DEA and your partners in addiction prevention and treatment programs around the world the tools and resources that you need to combat this crisis as never before. And, at the President's direction, our administration is hard at work, as we speak, with leaders in Congress to ensure that next year's budget gives you the resources you need to hire even more special agents and fill other positions that are vital to carrying out the DEA's missions. You fight for us every day; we are going to fight for you. That's a promise. (Applause.) So, we've made progress, as the Deputy Attorney General said, in the last two years. But the people in this room and the people that are looking on around the country and around the world know there is much work yet to be done. The truth is , and the President and I are very aware of this , the truth is that your jobs are as difficult and as dangerous today as ever before, largely driven by a crisis on our southern border fueling the very criminal syndicates and drug traffickers that you're dedicated to fighting. It's remarkable to think that, on any given day, some 2,000 individuals attempt to come into this country illegally. And for the first time ever, the vast majority of those are families and unaccompanied minors, driven by human traffickers and the cartels in an attempt to overwhelm our system to create even more access to the American people for their nefarious trade. The men and women of the DEA know firsthand the reality and the challenges that we face along our southern border and in this hemisphere. Transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America represent one of the greatest national security and public health threats in America. And every day that our southern border remains unsecured gives these criminals yet another opportunity to peddle their poison and spread their violence into communities large and small across this country. Now, let me assure you, as the debate goes on on Capitol Hill, one way or another, this President and this administration is going to secure our southern border for the sake of the American people and all of you who enforce our laws. (Applause.) And the challenges are real. Over the past two years, I'm informed that DEA agents have helped seize more than 50 million pounds of illicit drugs , 50 million pounds that you've apprehended , in domestic and foreign operations. Last year alone, DEA captured more than a half a million pounds of meth, 55,000 pounds of heroin, 1.7 million pounds of cocaine, and 1 ton of fentanyl. This is incredible work, and it's lifesaving work that you've done. We hear the tragic stories every day, in every community of this country, of drug abuse, addiction, overdose. I've sat with families at kitchen tables with an empty chair, and we know those stories. But the American people also deserve to know there are tragedies that never happened because of the work of the DEA, and the drugs that you stopped, and the criminal organizations that you disrupt. And, for that, you have our thanks and our admiration. A reality is, though, as we talk about securing our southern border, all of you know that many of our drugs still enter our nation through our southern border. Ninety percent of heroin, that claims 300 lives every single week in overdoses across this country comes through our southern border. I'm informed that 60 percent of the marijuana that makes its way into the United States from our southern border comes through areas apart from our ports of entry. And, again, it underscores the reason why this President and this administration remain so determined to secure our border. And we'll do just that. We'll do it, as the Acting Administrator said just a few moments ago to me. He said it's important that we do this end to end , that we have a physical barrier on our southern border, that we deploy personnel, that we deploy technologies. What the President is calling on the Congress to do today is an all-of-the-above strategy, but ""all-of-the-above"" includes a wall. ""All-of-the-above"" includes a physical barrier in the critical, high-density areas where our law enforcement communities says it's most needed. And we're going to continue to fight for just that. The truth is Mexican and Central American drug cartels are the principal wholesale source of drugs for street-level gangs and dealers across the United States. And the American people deserve to know it. Their deadly trade has brought untold suffering to millions of American families. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. And, in 2016, across America, 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. The illicit drug trade not only claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year, it also strengthens those criminal syndicates that the DEA works across this hemisphere and around the world to confront. It strengthens some of the most dangerous criminal syndicates in the world and fuels their heinous activities, from extortion to the unspeakable tragedy of human trafficking. These threats radiate across this hemisphere and extend the reach , and by extending the reach, rather, of America's law enforcement community, we are making America safer and more secure in ways that reach far beyond the criminal enterprise of drugs. Through this work, you've helped stem the tide of drugs into our community, but you've also impacted these criminal organizations. I particularly would point to the DEA's extraordinary work in Venezuela, a nation in crisis even as we speak, where your investigations have targeted the corrupt narco-dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro, and helped bring drug trafficking indictments and convictions against several members of Maduro's family and inner circle. The DEA has played a role, and now we see an Interim President in Venezuela. Freedom is rising in Venezuela, and your efforts have made a difference in empowering the people of Venezuela to reclaim their liberty. As the free world has watched, you've made contributions, there and around the world, in challenging criminal syndicates and corruption in government. In the days ahead, I just want to promise you that we will continue to stand strongly with each and every one of you to make sure , from our southern border, to every aspect of law enforcement in our country and within this agency , that you have the resources that you need to accomplish your mission and come home safe. I mean, the reality is that you have no ordinary jobs. You deal with a criminal element that is vile and violent without regard to human life. And I want to assure you that not only do you have the gratitude of your President and our entire administration for the work that each one of you do every day; not only do you have the gratitude of the American people for the work the DEA affects every single day, but I am confident that you also have the prayers of the American people. And I close today just simply with a prayer from those ancient words that, as you do your work, as you enforce our laws, as you save American families and communities, large and small, from the tragic scourge of drug abuse addiction and the tragedy that follows from it, that we pray that no harm would overtake you, no disaster would come near you, and that He will guard you in all your ways as you guard the American people. Thank you all. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1320024/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-dea-employee-engagement-event&speechType=1	Drugs Criminal Justice		Arlington, VA	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-dea-employee-engagement-event/
VSMP622019116	Mike Pence	2019-02-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence to DHS and Coast Guard Personnel	speech	"Thank you, Madam Secretary, and thank you for your great leadership. You all may be seated. To the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz, Vice Admiral Buschman, Director Padilla, Director Ayala, and to all of you serving in the uniform of the United States of America at every level, all of you who serve and protect the people of this nation: It is my honor to be here with all of you at Coast Guard Base Portsmouth. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) It is amazing to think, as we reflected earlier today on the work of the joint task force , it's amazing to think of all the different agencies and all the different courageous service that's represented here, and the difference that each and every one of you make. The Department of Homeland Security: Some 240,000 men and women who work each and every day to protect the homeland, to protect American families, to protect our cities, and to protect the nation against the scourge of drug addiction, the impact of criminal syndicates. So as I begin my remarks today, let me bring a word of gratitude, admiration, and appreciation from your Commander-in-Chief. I bring the thanks of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today to hear the latest on the efforts of the joint task force, but also just to express a word of appreciation to each and every one of you and, to no less extent, your families for the service that you render to the people of this country each and every day. I hope some of you had a chance to see the State of the Union Address last night. The President of the United States addressed the nation. He laid out a bold, bipartisan vision and called on the Congress to join the American people, to join each and every one of you, to choose greatness. But it is something I know each and every one of you do every day. The President called for unity in Washington. He asked members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to come together to ""build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock,"" in his words, ""the extraordinary promise of America's future."" And as the President said in his State of the Union , and I say with equal conviction, looking out at all of your shining faces and thinking of all that you represent here, across this department, across this country , indeed, the state of our union is strong and it is safer because of the work that all of you do every day. And the American people know it. Give yourselves another round of applause. (Applause.) And we know that your service comes with sacrifice for you and your families. And, frankly, your character shines through each and every day through deployments, through missions that you undertake. And the nation, frankly, saw your character in high relief in recent weeks when the President took a strong stand for border security during the government shutdown that lasted some 35 days. Let me say to each and every one of you: The President and I couldn't more grateful or couldn't be more proud of all our federal employees and their families who rose to the challenge, stayed on task. But we are especially grateful to the men and women of the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security. You stood tall, you stood your watch, you did not relent. And you have our thanks for your commitment to your mission and your duty. Thank you all. (Applause.) Thank you for standing your post. And just know this President and I, and our entire administration, have your back. And even as we speak today, the Congress is working on funding not only for the Coast Guard, for the Department of Homeland Security, but for other critical agencies of the government. And we're working in good faith to resolve these issues. But I promise each and every one of you, just as you stand and fight every day for the safety and security of the American people, President Donald Trump and I are going to stand and fight to get you what you need to accomplish your mission and keep the American people safe. That's our promise. (Applause.) We recognize, and I just heard in my briefing, your job is more challenging because our border is not secure along the southern border of the United States. A porous border along the United States gives drug traffickers and criminal cartels too many opportunities. And the traffic that the Coast Guard, the traffic that the joint task force interdicts all across the east coast through the Gulf of Mexico, and along the southern border of this country, is reflective of that reality. Enforcing our laws and protecting the American people is what all of you do best. And I just want to assure you, as evidenced in the President's words last night, as evidenced in the determination that he and our administration has reflected, we're going to continue to fight to get you what you need to accomplish that mission. And we are going to secure our border one way or another. (Applause.) Now, it is impressive to learn, Admiral, about this joint task force and to think about the interagency efforts. It really is remarkable to think about it. Joint Task Force-East, and West, and Investigations, do an extraordinary job leading a coalition of partners from across DHS, Coast Guard, Customs, Border Protection, Immigrations Customs Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship, Immigration Services, ICE. And of course, let's not forget, our great partners in local law enforcement who work with all of our federal agencies every single day. We respect and appreciate them as well. (Applause.) You also work hand-in-hand with the Department of Defense and our international partners to advance the security and prosperity here at home and, frankly, all across the Western Hemisphere. I just heard a briefing on our investigations division, and learned about how we have, literally, forward deployed to deal with those who would threaten our families and threaten our communities long before they're ever anywhere close to the border of the United States of America. And those international partnerships are vital to our efforts. The work you do every day saves lives, and it's remarkable to think about that. And I hope each and every one of you understands that the American people know it, from your Commander-in-Chief on down: The work that each and every one of you does every day stems the tide of narcotics that comes into this country that literally claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. We cannot account for the lives that are saved, but we know they are many. We think of the great news yesterday. I was just informed that the Coast Guard Cutter Forward, a sister ship of the Bear that I was just on, homeported here in Portsmouth. It literally offloaded more than 15 tons of cocaine that had been seized over the past two months during counter-narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific. Join me in thanking the whole crew of the Forward for a job well done that is saving American lives. (Applause.) The truth of the matter is, none of you in this room have to wonder whether you make a difference, because you do, every single day. And I want tell you, as I travel all across this country, I hear about the admiration of all of the agencies represented here. I hear the expressions of support, and I expect very recently you heard it as well, from communities and families that reached out to yours and just took the opportunity to let you know how grateful they are to each and every one of you. And I can assure you that is the , that is a reflection of the view of all of the American people. You know, I was on Capitol Hill on September 11, 2001. We didn't even have a Department of Homeland Security then. I'll never forget seeing the smoke rise from the Pentagon. And I'll never forget when we traveled to Ground Zero a week later, and saw the unspeakable devastation of the evil that had descended there. You, in a very real sense , all the agencies here, now under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security and the capable leadership of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , you're all a part of an American response that keeps our nation safe, that leans into the fight against those who would harm our families, who would seek to profit through narcotics, who would enslave people through human trafficking and the brutality that's represented there, and also who would seek to come into our country with criminal intent or terrorist intent. You make a difference every day. And I want you to know that we all know it, and we're grateful to each and every one of you. And I want to promise you, for all that you do every single day, President Donald Trump and our administration will always have your back. Our record, I hope, speaks for itself. Within a month in office, the President signed an executive order to strengthen the authority of DHS, the Coast Guard, and law enforcement at every level to combat transnational criminal organizations, and cartels, and gangs that threaten the American people and are constantly changing in their methods. Last August, the President signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act, updated the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act to make it easier for all of you and all those serving on the frontlines of law enforcement to bring maritime smugglers to justice. And we're grateful for the support in Congress that made that possible. And, of course, since the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has worked to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. In our first year in office, the President signed into law the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest military pay raise in nearly 10 years. (Applause.) And as the Commandant knows, there was more than $12 billion for the Coast Guard to rebuild your aging fleets and strengthen the vital assets of your mission. So congratulations to you all. (Applause.) So we've made incredible progress in the last two years, but the truth is, as I said before, we recognize that your jobs and all the agencies represented so well here , your jobs are as difficult and dangerous as ever, largely driven by the security and humanitarian crisis along the southern border of the United States. And we do have a crisis on our southern border. It's extraordinary to think that, every single day, some 2,000 people attempt to come into this country illegally. And those are just the people that are apprehended by agencies and Border Patrol so well represented here. Two thousand people a day coming into the United States of America. It's a security crisis. Last year alone, some 10,000 individuals with prior criminal convictions were apprehended attempting to come into the United States of America. But's it's also a humanitarian crisis. I don't need to tell all of you with responsibilities along our southern border, gathered here in this room, that for the first time ever, the majority of people seeking to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors , putting an enormous burden on our system. And it's a reflection of human traffickers and cartels that I learned today charge upwards of $5,000 per person to entice vulnerable families to take the long and dangerous journey up the peninsula , a journey that, for most, results in physical and sexual abuse along the way. And for some, even worse. We have cartels and human trafficking organizations , criminal syndicates , that take advantage of vulnerable families and take advantage of loopholes in our laws and our porous borders. And as the President of the United States said last night, ""This is a moral issue."" We have a moral duty to secure our border and reform the immigration laws of the United States of America. And we will do it. (Applause.) And the cost , the cost, you all know, is extraordinary. Every day our southern border remains unsecured gives criminal syndicates and drug traffickers and human traffickers another opportunity to threaten our families and harm people on both sides of the border. The men and women of the Coast Guard and DHS know firsthand about these transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America , the drug cartels that fuel their deadly trade. They represent one of the greatest national-security and public-health threats in the history of this country. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. In 2016, across America, 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. The illicit drug trade not only claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, it also strengthens; it strengthens the ability of those criminal syndicates in the world that engage in their heinous activities, from extortion to human trafficking, and worse. The challenges and threats that you personally face in the line of duty underscore the reason why we are so determined to give you the resources that you need to secure our border and protect this homeland. And we will do it. President Trump, as he described last night, has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. It's really an all-of-the-above plan. It's a plan that includes humanitarian assistance; more law enforcement personnel; drug detection technology at our ports of entry; closing loopholes that enable child smuggling; and a proposal for a new physical barrier. As the President said last night: A smart steel barrier on our southern border. Walls work, and we need to secure our border, including with a physical barrier. And we will do it one way or another. We're going to secure our border. That's our promise to each and every one of you. And we're going to support each one of you in the efforts that you make on behalf of the American people. In the days ahead, you can be confident that just as each and every one of you step forward to protect this nation every day, to stand up for the American people, we're going to continue to stand with you to give you the resources and the support that you need. So thank you all for coming out today. It's a great honorto meet you. I hope to get a chance to say hello to as many of you as possible in person. It's the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President, and I thank you for coming and spending a few minutes with me today in the midst of all of your duties. So I came here to say: We're with you. We're going to stand with you. We're going to continue to fight to give you the resources that you need to protect the homeland and secure our border. But as I said before, I also came here just to say thanks. The Good Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. Let me assure each and every one of you, the American people honor your service. We respect the way you've answered the call for this country. I was sitting down in the Mess Hall of the Bear just a few minutes ago. And one of those Coast Guardsmen , I looked across at him and I asked him, ""Why did you join the Coast Guard?"" He'd been in about 12 years. Talked about how he remembered 9/11. He just wanted to do something for his country and to protect his country. And I think what's remarkable about that answer is it's very typical of, I know, how all of you feel. Public service is a calling. Public safety is a calling. It's a calling to a mission to consider others as more important than yourself; to count your life as less important than the lives of your countrymen. And so, I really came here to say thank you. I came here to say thank you. Thank you to each and every one of you for your service. Thank you for what you do to keep the American people safe each and every day. And just know that while you have our thanks, you have our support, I'm also confident that you do have the prayers of millions of Americans. So I'll close with that prayer as well, that ""no harm will overtake you no disaster will [ever] come near [you] and [may] He guard you in all your ways,"" as you guard the people of the United States of America. So thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

VSMP722019115	Mike Pence	2019-02-07	Remarks by Vice President Pence to High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program Directors and Deputy Direc ...	speech	"Thank you very much. And why don't you join me in thanking Kellyanne Conway for her great work on the President's commission to combat opiate abuse and addiction, and for her great words today? Kellyanne, thank you so much. (Applause.) It's an honor to be with all of you today. Director McDaniel, thank you also for your remarks and your outstanding leadership. It is an honor to be here today with so many courageous men and women, so many representatives of law enforcement at every level from all across this country , leaders of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program. On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. (Applause.) And while I get started, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine. We just finished up a meeting; it accounts for a little bit of my delay today. But I have to tell you, I sure do hope you all know what people who wear the uniform of law enforcement, I think, know all across this country: You have a champion in the 45th President of the United States of America. And I bring greetings and gratitude from President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President and the First Lady , just like my wife and I, and our family, our entire administration , are, frankly, humbled by the service and sacrifice of those who protect and serve all across our country. In fact, First Lady Melania Trump today spoke to the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, and is actually visiting the Office of National Drug Policy today. It is a commitment of our First Family. I can assure you it is a commitment of our family. And I know it's a commitment that your family lives out each and every day, and we hope you'll convey our deep thanks to them as well. You know, my uncle was a police officer. I grew up traveling from the small town in southern Indiana, where my family lived, to go up to my Dad's old hometown in Chicago. And I'll never forget the times that we were there and my uncle would put on his uniform and head out, and me and my three brothers and two sisters would always be so inspired. You know, you have no ordinary job. The truth of the matter is, when you put on that uniform every day and you head out, that you and your families know what the stakes are. So let me just assure you that you are heroes to your President, to his Vice President, and you are heroes and your families are heroes to every American. And we thank you for your service. (Applause.) We do. What brings us here today , and I trust is evident to each one of you, in working in this critical federal and state effort , is that President Trump has made the fight against illegal drugs a top priority of this administration. You heard his commitment to that mission just two days ago in a State of the Union Address, as the President told the nation that we are committed to put ""drug dealers out of business"" and ""truly make America safe."" (Applause.) And for more than 30 years, all of you involved in the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program , ""HIDTA,"" for short , have played a critical role in the fight against drug trafficking. You target places where the drug crisis is at its worst; the counties where the overwhelming majority of illegal narcotics are smuggled into our country and into our communities. You literally are on the frontlines in the war against illegal drug abuse and addiction. To combat the crisis, the HIDTA program has forged an unprecedented cooperation, evident here today in this room, between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement authorities from the FBI, to the DEA, to city police chiefs, and county sheriffs. It is a nationwide, every-level commitment to combat drug abuse and addiction in America, and we are grateful for your leadership and service. We truly are. (Applause.) You know, there's no program like it anywhere in America. You share information, best practices with one another. You stand shoulder-to-shoulder to arrest smugglers, shut down manufacturers, get the deadliest substances off our streets. We all know the statistics of the heartbreak, the loss of life, and devastated families from drug abuse and addiction, and the nefarious drug trade in this country. But you are also responsible every day for the stories that never happened. The drugs that never got to the streets. The families that were never shattered. And I want you all to know that the American people, this President, and our administration understand that and are grateful for it. Today, this program is active in 29 key regions across the country, spread across all 50 states. From the southwest border to Appalachia, more than 21,000 law enforcement personnel are working every day to fight gangs, cartels, drug runners , large and small. Our administration has created the first new HIDTA initiative in 17 years when we brought this critical program to Alaska. We are growing a program that is winning in the fight against drug abuse and addiction in America. (Applause.) And this program has been a great success. In our first year in office, the men and women of the HIDTA program broke up smuggling rings with ties to major transnational criminal organizations. You disrupted or dismantled more than 2,700 drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. You also got more than 23,000 firearms off our streets and made more than 90,000 arrests. All told, you seized more than $16 billion in illegal drugs. Thanks to your courage and dedication, those drugs never reached our streets, our cities, our families. The American people are grateful. (Applause.) You know, when I was governor of the state of Indiana, I put a special emphasis, as the President has nationwide, on the scourge of opiate abuse and addiction. I've sat with families at kitchen tables where there's an empty chair. I've heard their stories. I've also sat with people who have overcome addiction and are on the road to recovery. I've seen firsthand the impact of the work that you're doing, and I want to assure you of our admiration and our gratitude. These statistics are easy to breeze over, but you all look into the eyes of people that have been victimized by this nefarious trade, by the drug cartels, by drug dealers, and those who would profit from selling these poisons to our children, our families, shattering communities. The progress we've made, I think, is better understood in individual stories, in individual lives. And you all have been saving lives and you've been changing lives. And we've been making progress. Progress is a result of your leadership and your courage. And I believe it's also the result of our President's commitment to you and to your mission. Since day one of this administration, I'm pleased to report we've taken action to give you the support you need to accomplish your mission. Within the first month of taking office, President Trump signed an executive order to empower law enforcement to combat transnational criminal organizations, drug cartels, and gangs more effectively. He signed into law the historic opioid bill that enables law enforcement to combat the opioid crisis as never before. He's taken action and signed legislation to combat the terrible reality of human trafficking that so often follows a similar path of drug smuggling. And this President has not only been giving you the resources, but after challenging years for those in the uniform of the United States, this President and this administration have given the men and women of law enforcement the respect that you deserve every single day, and we always will. (Applause.) We're fighting for you because we know every day you're fighting for the American people. You're considering the lives of others more important than your own. And we know it's a calling, and it's a profound calling that involves sacrifice for you and your families. But you're making a difference. But despite the progress we've made, we know there are a , literally, a river of illegal drugs still flows toward our country every single day. I received a briefing just yesterday at Coast Guard Base Portsmouth, down in Virginia, and saw firsthand the flows of narcotics coming out of South America and Central America. I also learned of the daring Coast Guardsmen who just sailed into port with more than 15 tons of cocaine they had captured from drug smugglers at sea. This mission is succeeding every single day. But nowhere is the crisis of illegal drug trafficking more evident, or our challenge more profound, than at our nation's southern border. And you know firsthand how serious this crisis is because the southwest border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area is among the most active in this entire program. Last year, Customs and Border Protection seized more than 827,000 pounds of illegal drugs entering our country at our southern border , and that's just the drugs that they found. Mexican and Central American drug cartels, as you well know, are the main wholesale provider of drugs to street gangs and dealers across America, and their deadly trade brings suffering and devastation to families and communities across this nation. As the President said on Tuesday night, ""Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities."" Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin, more than 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. And all told, across the nation, as you know, at the front of this fight, more than 200 people lose their lives to drug overdose every single day. Our hearts grieve for the loss of so many innocent lives, and they break for the families that have been left behind. We honor them by remembering them, but we also honor them by redoubling our commitment to secure our border and bring justice to those who would profit from their suffering. (Applause.) Just last week, Director Carroll unveiled our administration's National Drug Control Strategy. He described it aptly as a ""strategy of action."" And so it is.And that strategy lays out our comprehensive plan to combat illegal drug use and drug smuggling, and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program is essential to our efforts. We believe in combining the capabilities of the federal government and the expertise of local law enforcement. It's a powerful combination, and you can be confident of our continued support. We'll also make new and renewed investments in law enforcement at every level, as President Trump renewed his call for Congress to enact stronger ""drug protection at our ports."" And when it comes to the southern border, as Congress is involved in negotiations, even at this very hour, let me assure you: We will not rest or relent until we have the technology, the personnel, and the barriers required to secure our southern border. We will build that wall one way or another. (Applause.) So thank you again. Thank you again for your presence here today, but more importantly, thank you , thank you for your service. I said before, when I started about , I remember looking up at my uncle when he would walk out the door in that uniform. And, frankly, all of my , all the heroes in my life are people that wear uniforms. Men and women of our armed forces, I'm the son of a combat veteran from Korea, and I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. And I couldn't be more proud of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. But let me assure you, the pride , the pride that every American feels for those who serve in that uniform equally applies to you. And we know it would seem fashionable in recent years to criticize law enforcement officers whenever tragic circumstances would develop in communities around the country. But I want to assure you that this President's attitude, our attitude, is emblematic of the attitude of the people all across this country who feel gratitude to each and every one of you and to your families for the service that you render as you protect and serve our communities and in this fight against drug dealers, drug abuse, and addiction at every level of government. I want you to know that you have the support of this President, this administration. But also know you have the support of the American people. And one other thing: I want to assure you that you have the prayers of millions of Americans every day who understand that you have no ordinary jobs. I mean, the truth of the matter is, as you walk out the door in the morning and you kiss your loved ones goodbye, you know , and they know , you have no ordinary job. And so just know you go with our support, our renewed determination to give you the resources and the tools you need to drive this mission forward at every level of government to protect our families and confront the scourge of drug abuse and addiction and drug dealing as never before in this country. But also know that you go with our prayers. And my prayer today would be to claim those ancient words that no harm would befall you, no disaster would come near you; that He would guard you in all your ways as you protect and serve the American people. So thank you. God bless you. Stay on it. And we'll stay with you every step of the way. (Applause.) And with your continued courage, with our President's leadership, and with God's help, I know we will end the scourge of illegal drugs, and we will make America safer than ever before. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1320681/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-high-intensity-drug-trafficking-area-hidta-program-directors-and-deputy-directors&speechType=1	National Security Defense Drugs		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-high-intensity-drug-trafficking-area-hidta-program-directors-deputy-directors/
VSMP822019114	Mike Pence	2019-02-08	Remarks by Vice President Pence to DHS and CBP Personnel	speech	Well, thank you, Deputy Commissioner Perez. Thank you for your leadership and thank you for your kind words, and thank you for your service to the nation. Will you all join me in thanking the Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection for the United States of America, Mr. Robert Perez? (Applause.) Thank you for all you do. To Director Rottman, Director Durst, to my friend Congressman Andy Harris, to all of you serving here at the Port of Baltimore in Customs and Border Protection: It is a great, great honor to be here with all of you today to say a very simple thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for all you do every day to ensure the flow of commerce and ensure the safety and security of the American people. Let's give CBP a round of applause here at the Port of Baltimore. (Applause.) It is remarkable to think about how long the Port of Baltimore has played a role in the life of this nation since even before this nation was founded. And it continues to play a vital role in the commerce of our nation today. And all of you involved in Customs and Border Protection here at the Port of Baltimore play a vital role in ensuring that that commerce happens , happens in a way that protects the interests and the wellbeing of the American people. And before I get started, let me bring greetings , for all the good words that the Deputy Commissioner said about me , let me bring greetings from a friend of mine, a great admirer of Customs and Border Protection, and a man who is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of the American people and protecting the homeland and standing with all who protect it. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The work you do here every day saves lives. But we also recognize that you're on the frontlines. And the risk that you take in enforcing our laws sometimes comes with the ultimate price. And let me say, with the Deputy Commissioner here, we today join our hearts and our prayers with the family of Border Patrol Agent Donna Doss. She'll be laid to rest this afternoon in Taylor County, Texas. The tragic accident that claimed her life on duty is a reminder that all of you who serve, all of you who wear the uniform of Customs and Border Protection, do so in no small way that reflects that you've put our lives ahead of your own. And so we remember her and we remember her family today. As I said, I'm here to say thank you. But I'm also here to learn more about the work that each and every one of you do. The briefing that I just received from the senior leadership here was very impressive and a reminder of how you bring state-of-the-art technology and time-honored tried and true methods to ensure that the commerce that flows here flows here legally and flows here in a way that doesn't threaten the wellbeing of the American people. President Trump laid out a vision this last Tuesday before the Congress of the United States and the American people. He laid out a vision that we might choose American greatness. And let me say, each one of you have already made that choice. And I'm here to recognize that the state of our union is strong, the state of our union is safe because of the work of Customs and Border Protection. And you have our thanks. (Applause.) You know, the President and I , and, frankly, all of the American people , couldn't be more grateful for the work that you do every day. And you don't hear that thanks often enough, I expect. The character of all of you who wear the uniform came into high relief, particularly over the last month, when the President took such a strong stand for border security and we saw a government shut down for 35 days. We're grateful to all the federal employees and their families who continued to work during this difficult time. But standing before all of you, let me say, we're particularly grateful today to the men and women of CBP, DHS. You all stood tall, you stayed on your watch in the midst of that shutdown, you stayed on mission. And I want to say thank you to you and your families for standing your post and never letting down during those days. (Applause.) And as the Congress continues to negotiate, even at this very hour, it's about funding our Department of Homeland Security, this very agency, and your efforts. I want to promise you: The President and I are going to continue to work tirelessly to get you the resources and the support that you need to accomplish that mission for the sake of all of the American people. The men and women of DHS know firsthand how vitally important this mission is, and particularly those of you who work every day in Customs and Border Protection. You see firsthand the transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America. The drug cartels that fuel their deadly trades represent unquestionably one of the greatest national security and public health threats in the United States of America. Last year, Customs and Border Protections seized more than 827,000 pounds of illegal drugs entering our country just at our southern border alone. Mexican and Central American drug cartels are the main wholesale providers of drugs to street gangs and dealers. And their deadly trade brings suffering to millions of American families. As the President said this past Tuesday, as you know full well, tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by illegal drugs that cross into our border, flood into our cities. Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. But all told , all told, in the efforts reflected here , nevertheless, nearly 200 people in America lose their lives to drug overdose every single day. The mission that you perform here and the President's determination to secure our southern border has an enormous impact on the wellbeing of the American people, the safety and security of our communities and our families. And I have to tell you, seeing the work that you do here, and seeing the cutting-edge technology that you utilize, gives me great confidence that, as we continue to support your work, we will continue to confront the flow of illegal drugs into America as never before. Cutting-edge technologies that I just was briefed on that detect and seize contraband brought into the country. It's remarkable to think of that non-intrusive inspective technology I just looked over; large-scale X-ray and gamma ray imaging, allowing you to look into shipping containers and commercial trucks. And I have to tell you, I just mentioned to the director, I was so impressed that your training is so precise that you'll look at the manifest, and if the X-ray scan doesn't actually look like the vehicle that's described on the manifest, you'll begin the inspection. Now, that's an attention to detail that would inspire any American. Portable and handheld devices that allow you to make sure that smaller contraband in cars and on individuals is caught as well. These technologies, we know, are force multipliers. And last year, they helped you stop nearly a quarter of a million pounds of narcotics from entering the country, as well as a million dollars in foreign currency. That is a record of success the Port of Baltimore CBP should be proud of, and so are we. Now, we also are impressed that , by the time-honored tradition , just diligence, carefulness. And I also witnessed the highly trained canine teams that are utilized here. I even got a playing card from Zombie. And I have to tell you, seeing the way that these canines are capable of detecting even the faintest signs of deadly drugs, radioactive materials, and stowaways is impressive indeed. And Customs and Border Protection has been in the forefront of canine training and detection from the very beginning. In fact, CBP just announced the largest fentanyl bust in history at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona. Thanks to CBP's canine team, we've prevented more than 250 pounds of fentanyl from entering our country and flooding our streets. That would be enough fentanyl to kill nearly one third of the population of the United States. I think that's worth a round of applause for Customs and Border Protection. (Applause.) You know, the Old Book says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And I hope, if you hear nothing more from me today, you hear us , you're here to pay a debt of honor and a debt of respect to all of you who put in the long hours and do the tireless work that is saving lives. Whether it makes the front page of the newspaper or not, I want you to know, from the President on down, we know that your work here is vital to the safety and security of the American people, even as you facilitate the flow of commerce in our growing economy. And we're truly grateful. The truth though is, today, your jobs are as difficult and dangerous as ever with the security and humanitarian crisis that we face at our southern border. Every day that our southern border remains unsecured, it gives the very criminal syndicates and drug traffickers that you confront literally in the form of contraband and illegal drugs every day here in the Port of Baltimore , it gives them more resources and more ability to peddle their poison and destroy American lives and families. Now, I want to assure you , I want to assure you that you have the support of this President and our entire administration, and of the American people, as you go about your task. And I want you to make you a promise. I want to make you a promise that we're going to continue , we're going to continue to work to secure our border , north, south, east, and west. When it comes to our southern border, as the negotiations continue, we will not rest, we will not relent until our Customs and Border Protection have the technology, the personnel, and the barriers required to secure our border. We're going to build that wall, one way or another. I promise you. (Applause.) So thank you for the work you do here today. Thank you for taking time away from your busy workday to give me such a warm welcome. I look forward to being able to meet as many of you as time permits. But I really came here to learn more but also to say thanks and assure you of our ongoing support. And I'll assure you of one other thing: You know, each and every day, you put on that uniform , we know it's no ordinary job. You come here at the Port of Baltimore, and the nation is safer because of your diligence and your commitment. And so I want you to know that you have the gratitude and, I'm confident, the prayers of the American people as you stand in the gap for the safety and security of our people and our families and our communities. And on behalf of our President and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say to all of you who work so diligently every day here at the Port of Baltimore: Keep up the good work. Stay focused on your task at hand. Know that the American people are with you, and we're going to continue to fight to give you the resources you need to accomplish that mission. And we will confront illegal drugs and all of its consequences as never before. And with your help, and with God's help, we will make great progress in this nation. We will save lives. And America will be safer than ever before. Thank you very much. God bless you and your work. And God bless the United States of America.

VSMP1322019113	Mike Pence	2019-02-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence and President Duda of Poland in Joint Press Statement	speech	"PRESIDENT DUDA: Your Excellency, most distinguished Mr. Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence; distinguished Minister of National Defense; esteemed Mrs. Pence, the Second Lady of the United States; all distinguished guests led by the Ambassador of the United States to Poland; ladies and gentlemen: I am delighted and we are delighted, together with my wife, to be able to host the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, together with his wife here in Warsaw. We are happy that the visit paid by Mr. Vice President, which is connected, of course, with the Middle East conference, which will soon start, as its first item has got this political bilateral component between our two countries , between Poland and the United States. And today, for a few hours, we have been able to touch upon important and interesting topics of interest, which, in this space between the United States and Poland today, constitute the most important issues , issues connected with our cooperation with the NATO Alliance and our economic cooperation. Our meeting today started on a very symbolic note. It started when Minister of Defense Mariusz Błaszczak signed today an agreement on the future deliveries to Poland of High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, HIMARS, which I hope are one of the most important elements of the revolution in the Polish defense military infrastructure which we have been implementing for a couple of years now, which we refer to as the modernization process of the Polish Armed Forces. This is the cutting-edge equipment from the United States, which I believe is going to serve to strengthen our security. I am delighted indeed that, together with Mr. Vice President and our wives, we had an opportunity to meet with our troops as well. We had Polish soldiers present at the ceremony, as well as the soldiers of the U.S. Armed Forces. The meeting was very pleasant and nice. But, at the same time, it had a very symbolic element in it, demonstrating American presence , military presence , in Poland as part of the North Atlantic Alliance and as part of the alliance between our two states. We also discussed, together with Mr. Vice President, some , precisely the U.S. military presence. I'm really delighted because Mr. Vice President said that U.S. soldiers and U.S. officers who are deployed in Poland, and those who were in Poland before, assessed very highly the conditions here, briefly speaking, that they are pleased with their stay, with their service in Poland. I heard that the conditions we have provided them with are considered to be absolutely appropriate. I'm happy to share that they are pleased with the cooperation with the Polish military authorities and civilian authorities as well. So I'm happy that our cooperation is going on very smoothly. I hope that our joint efforts aimed at increasing the presence of U.S. Armed Forces in Poland are going to bring effects soon. In the nearest future, first, planning decisions are going to be taken in this respect. This is what we should expect. We also discussed other issues, which are clearly included in the Declaration on Enhanced Strategic Partnership, which myself and President Donald Trump signed in Washington. Namely, we talked about the energy cooperation. We also talked about economic cooperation. The energy cooperation is a topic of great importance in our mutual relations. Today, we have already signed a series of agreements to import LNG to our Świnoujście terminal. Right now, works are ongoing, connected with increasing the capacity of that LNG terminal. We hope that the works will be concluded, with an expected effect and planned effect. In other words, we hope to increase this capacity to more than 7 billion cubic meters of gas per year. And we do hope that a large amount of that gas, which is supplied to Poland, is going to be supplied precisely from the United States. Apart from that, we are planning to make further investments in this respect, and this is what I flagged out in my conversation with Mr. Vice President. We also discussed the development of gas network in our part of Europe. We discussed gas security. We also discussed energy security. And, as far as other sources of energy are concerned , electricity, for instance , I also mentioned that Minister Piotr Naimski, on the 11th of March, is going to discuss about this in the United States with the Secretary responsible for energy within the U.S. administration, Mr. Rick Perry. These are going to be talks about cybersecurity and also gas energy cooperation. But these talks will also concern cooperation on electricity. So these are going to be the topics of interest, topics of importance, in which we are going to implement this enhanced partnership in the nearest future. This is also something that we discussed today with Mr. Vice President. Apart from that, we talked about general business cooperation. Poland right now is developing very fast. Our economic (inaudible) has been better than we expected, better than the analysts predicted, including different global agencies. So that situation is very good, and I believe that also further American investments and our investments of the Polish business in the United States are going to contribute to the development of the situation. Of course, we also discussed cybersecurity, which is most important right now in the global space. Once again, let me stress that I'm delighted with this important visit paid by Mr. Vice President to Poland. I'm delighted with this (inaudible) in a series of meetings with top representatives of the U.S. administration. And last year, I paid a visit to Washington, and before, President Donald Trump visited Warsaw. All of us have vivid memories of that visit. And I hope that our contacts this year, Mr. Vice President, are going to be very intensive indeed, because this is a special year in which we are celebrating the centennial of establishing diplomatic relations between Poland and the United States, and between Poland, which was reborn in 1918, and the first great global superpower which acknowledged Poland back then as a reborn state. That superpower was the United States of America in 1919. And after the declaration of President Woodrow Wilson, that was another beautiful gesture made by the United States vis-à-vis the Polish State. And all of us remember that until the day. Having said that, I also hope that also this year is going to be of special importance, but unique in our relations. Once again, thank you very much. Thank you to you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you to the Second Lady of the United States for their presence in Poland. And I hope that to you, Mr. Vice President, it's going to be a fruitful visit, and to both of you, it's going to be a fruitful and successful visit to our country. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And now I would like to ask the Vice President of the United States to give his statement, Mr. Michael Pence. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you, President Duda. Thank you for those very kind words and for the warm hospitality that you and the First Lady have shown to my wife Karen and me during our very first visit to Poland. I couldn't be more honored to be here representing the United States of America, to join you here in this beautiful place, in this historic year in the life of this nation, to reflect on and to celebrate the remarkable bond that exists between our peoples and our two nations. And, Mr. President, I'm here today on behalf of a friend of yours who came to this country just two years ago, who welcomed you to the White House last September, and a great champion of the United States, Poland alliance. I bring greetings this morning from President Donald Trump. The United States and Poland have a shared and special bond since the very earliest days of our republic. Today, Polish-Americans are one of the most vibrant threads of the American fabric. We cherish their rich heritage, we admire the great faith of the Polish people, and we continue to draw inspiration from their steadfast love of freedom. Mr. President, our countries are friends because we share the same values , a point that you and I reflected on in all of our conversations today. And in a world that's growing more unpredictable , and, in many ways, more dangerous since the fall of the Soviet Union , our alliance has grown more vital and more important than ever before. That's why, as you and I just discussed, our countries are working more closely together on a wide range of issues, and we will continue to. And thanks to your leadership, Mr. President, and that of President Trump, today the United States, Poland alliance is stronger than ever before. In the last two years, our countries have made unprecedented investments in our common defense and shown the world that our commitment to the NATO Alliance is unwavering. Last March, the United States was proud to support Poland's purchase of the Patriot missile defense system , a battle-tested, NATO-interoperable system that is used by the United States Army and many of our closest allies to protect their people and defend their sovereignty. Last September, I was pleased to join President Trump as he hosted you at the White House. There, the two of you signed a joint declaration of strategic partnership. And under that agreement, our nations are already improving our intelligence sharing, expanding our joint military exercises, and strengthening our collaboration in the fight against cyber threats to ensure that we're prepared to face the security challenges of the future together. And just today, it was my great honor, along with you, Mr. President, to represent the United States at a very special ceremony as your Defense Minister signed a historic agreement to purchase 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers from the United States, as an ongoing testament to our close security cooperation. And now, our two countries are discussing the parameters for increased United States military presence in Poland. And I'll be carrying back your strong convictions regarding that to President Trump and to our leaders in the Defense Department when I return to the United States. Poland is one of only eight NATO Allies who currently meet the commitment to spend at least 2 percent of your gross domestic product on defense. And today, thousands of American soldiers stand guard at the eastern flank of the NATO Alliance along with your soldier-in-arms, as well. Just a few hours ago, I shared that moment that you just described, Mr. President, to address several hundred American soldiers in the presence of hundreds of Polish soldiers stationed near Powidz. These men and women are freedom's first line of defense in Eastern Europe. They have the gratitude of Polish people, the gratitude and admiration of the American people and of freedom-loving people around the world. But just as important to our national security is our economic security. And we spoke much about that today, Mr. President. So last September, you and President Trump also announced a new ""U.S.-Poland Strategic Dialogue on Energy."" And we welcome that. That effort was designed to ensure that neither of our countries, nor any country in Europe, becomes dependent on Russia for its energy needs. Since last October, Poland has signed three separate agreements with American energy companies, which, in four years' time, will allow you to import more than 7 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year. And we welcome this collaboration. Now we look forward to working with you as you develop other energy sources, including nuclear power, as we discussed today. And President Trump and I, and our administration, are truly grateful for your bold stand in opposition to Nord Stream 2. The United States also welcomes Poland's partnership as we work to protect the telecommunications sector from China. The recent action that your government has taken against a Huawei executive and a Polish national accused of cooperating with him demonstrate your government's commitment to ensure our telecommunications sector is not compromised in a way that threatens our national security. We must continue to work together to ensure that all investment review mechanisms protect critical security and economic infrastructure going forward. And, Mr. President, we are grateful for your leadership and your actions. The United States stands behind Poland as it has stepped up and taken a leadership role as well in the Three Seas Initiative. As President Trump said not long ago, ""With the expanded trade and new infrastructure"" between our two countries, ""we [can] unleash incredible energy innovation that's safe, responsible, and environmentally friendly."" And these actions, the relationship between our two nations, will continue to grow stronger, and the future of security in Europe will grow brighter. But we know there is still more work to do on many fronts.No threat looms larger in Poland than the specter of aggression from your neighbor to the east. Despite years of negotiations, Russian forces still occupy large parts of Georgia and Ukraine, and they recently unlawfully detained Ukrainian ships and their crews in the Black Sea. Moscow seeks to divide our alliance, with its oil and gas reserves, with its new arsenal of nuclear weapons, and with its efforts to meddle in elections across Europe and around the world. But in the face of these provocations, and in solidarity with Poland and our European partners, President Trump has done more to confront Russia's actions than any President in modern history. Now, the Polish people need no lecture on the dangers of an aggressive Russia. And our neighbors to the east would do well not to underestimate the capabilities of our combined armed forces or to underestimate the indomitable will of the Polish people. In recent years, Poland has become one of our most crucial allies and a major player in world affairs. Poland sent one of the largest contingents of troops to our allied operations in Iraq and was a valued member of our 79-partner-strong coalition to defeat ISIS. And this week, Poland is taking another leading role of worldwide significance, Mr. President, as your nation hosts the very first-ever ""Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East."" Mr. President, I do want to extend the thanks of President Trump and all the American people to the people of Poland for taking this strong stand in support of peace and prosperity and the advance of human rights across the Middle East. And your willingness to host this conference, historic as it is, is a testament to your commitment to those values and those principles. And today, Mr. President, as you stand with us, we'll stand with you and the people of Poland as we seek to build a brighterfuture in the Middle East and for all freedom-loving people across the world. And today, Mr. President, I'm here just to say thank you , thank you to you and all the Polish people, on behalf of the people of the United States of America. We're allies, yes, but more than that, we're friends. We have an abiding friendship that's grounded in the ideals of freedom and democracy, and it's grounded in generations of heritage. With your leadership in Poland, with the leadership of President Donald Trump in the United States, with the friendship and the unbreakable bond between our two peoples, and with God's help, I know we'll continue to advance the prosperity and security of both of our countries. And together, we will forge a brighter future for all of the world. As the great Polish hero Lech Wałęsa once said, ""We hold our heads high, despite the price we have paid, because freedom is priceless."" Today, we in the United States hold our heads high , just as you do and the Polish people do, Mr. President , as we stand shoulder to shoulder with you for the priceless gift of freedom. So thank you for your hospitality. God bless you. God bless Poland. And God bless the United States of America.

VSMP1322019112	Mike Pence	2019-02-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence to U.S. and Polish Armed Forces of the 33rd Air Base	speech	"VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Duda, Madam First Lady, Minister Błaszczak, and to all the members of the Armed Forces of Poland, all the members of the Armed Forces of the United States of America: Thank you for this inspiring welcome to the great nation of Poland. (Applause.) And before I begin, would you join me in showing your appreciation , I couldn't be more proud of her , my wife of 33 years, a Marine Corps mom, but someone who you just heard is dedicating her time and her energy to supporting military families and spouses. Join me in thanking the Second Lady of the United States of America for her presence and her inspiring words. (Applause.) Mr. President, it's an honor to be here in Poland, a bastion of freedom in Central Europe, to address the Armed Forces of the United States and the men and women of the 33rd Air Base in Powidz. And to the men and women of the Polish Armed Forces who are here today, from the bottom of my heart, on behalf of the American people and on behalf of all the men and women in the uniform of the United States who stand shoulder to shoulder with you, thank you for standing strong in the defense of freedom. (Applause.) I couldn't be more proud of all of the Americans who are serving here. Nearly 5,000 strong deployed here across Poland as a part of our strong and unbreakable alliance through NATO. But I must say, I take particular pleasure, Mr. President, in the fact that there are a number of service members here from my home state of Indiana, my fellow Hoosiers. (Applause.) Deployed six months ago, the men and women of the 252nd Support Maintenance Company of the Indiana National Guard , I'll tell you, the home state is proud of you and so am I. Thank you for your service. (Applause.) And to all my fellow Americans who are here, to all of our friends across Poland, let me bring greetings from a great admirer of Poland and the Polish people, a great admirer and friend to your President. I bring greetings from the leader of the free world and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here in Poland simply to say thank you. First and foremost, thank you to all of you for stepping up to serve, for standing united to defend our freedom and our collective security. You come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us. You are heroes all. And as the Second Lady just said, we're especially grateful to your families back home. They serve as well, and I hope before the day is out, you'll send them word that they have our thanks and our admiration as well. I'm happy to report to my fellow Americans here that, since the first day of this administration, President Trump has been taking decisive action to strengthen the Armed Forces of the United States, to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy. And we have made the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger still. (Applause.) Just in the past two years, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the final days of the Cold War. And if you didn't notice, we gave our troops the biggest pay raise that you received in nearly 10 years. We released a national security strategy advancing peace across the wider world, as well , peace through American strength, and the strength of strong alliances with freedom- loving nations around the world. We initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And just last month, President Trump unveiled our nation's new strategy for missile defense. But I'm here in Poland, and before the week is out, I'll travel to Munich in the coming days to bring a message, on behalf of our President, to the people of Poland, and to freedom-loving people everywhere. And it's simply this: We are with you, we will stand with you, and the United States of America stands with Poland as a part of the most successful mutual defense alliance in the history of the world, and we always will. (Applause.) Under President Trump, the United States will always put the security and prosperity of America first. But as the President has made clear, and as all of you demonstrate each and every day, America first does not mean America alone. And the United States will always stand with the people of Poland , just, frankly, as we've done through the long and storied history of friendship that ties together our two nations together. It's remarkable to think our ancestors fought side by side in my nation's War for Independence more than two centuries ago. To this day, the American people honor the sacrifice of Polish heroes who shed blood alongside American patriots in the cause of our freedom, men like Tadeusz Kościuszko and Casimir Pułaski.Last year marked the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of freedom here in Poland at the end of the First World War. And this year, we celebrate 100 years of restored diplomatic ties between Poland and the United States of America. It is a century of bond and an unbreakable friendship. (Applause.) Thirty years ago, the Polish people cast off their Soviet oppressors and once again reclaimed your liberty. Just 20 years ago, joined the United States and our allies in that historic transatlantic alliance , the NATO Alliance forged to ensure our common defense. And nearly two years ago, President Trump stood in the heart of Warsaw , in Krasiński Square , and declared to the people of Poland and all of the world that the United States will continue to stand, in his word, and defend ""the priceless ties that bind us together as nations, as allies, and as a civilization."" We will always stand with the Polish people for liberty, democracy, the rule of law, and the respect for the dignity of every human life. (Applause.) In so many ways, the world is even a more dangerous place today than it was since the fall of Communism a quarter-century ago. And to confront the threats that we face today, the people of Poland know, and the people of the United States know, that the free world needs the members of NATO to be strong and united. And so we are. We stand together in defense of our alliance and all that we hold dear. And each member nation, we know, has a vital role to play. At the heart of our NATO Alliance is a solemn promise that an attack on one is an attack on all. But to keep this oath requires preparation, it requires investment. And for every NATO member to uphold their commitment to our common defense, we need to work together. And because of your history, the people of Poland understand this all too well , which is why even in our first year in office, Poland was one of only four other NATO members that fulfilled their promise to spend 2 percent of your gross domestic product toward our mutual defense. And, Mr. President, you have our admiration and our thanks. (Applause.) We thank you for your leadership. We thank you for your efforts and your nation's commitment to increase military spending, to provide for our common defense, and to advance the common interest of freedom in our alliance. You know, the United States has long supported this vital alliance. It's a cornerstone of our common defense. And as President Trump said here nearly two years ago, we are once again demonstrating our commitment, as he said, ""not merely with words, but with actions."" Around the world, the United States is once again standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. And there's no better proof than the steps we've taken to strengthen our relationship with the nation of Poland. Last September, President Trump and President Duda signed the Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership to reaffirm our nations' ironclad commitment to our historic alliance. And, in just a few moments, Poland is taking its place among the most capable and formidable nations in the world when we officially acknowledge an agreement by Poland to purchase a battalion's worth of High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers from the United States of America. And, Mr. President, we are pleased to partner with you in Poland's national defense. (Applause.) Mr. President, because of your leadership, this new long-range, precision-fire system will provide a critical new capability to the Polish military. It'll strengthen also the cooperation between our new nations , two nations, and it'll help protect Central and Eastern Europe from air and missile attacks for decades to come. And we are grateful for your vision and your leadership in securing these resources. You know, no matter what threats the future may hold, all of you gathered here today , the Armed Forces of Poland and the Armed Forces of the United States , can be confident of this: The United States will never waver in our commitment to our common defense. (Applause.) We will be strong in arms, strong in resolve, and most of all, strong in our conviction that, as President Trump said nearly two years ago, and I quote, ""The West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph."" (Applause.) This is our cause. It's why NATO exists. It's why the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Poland and the Polish people , today and every day. And standing here today, looking out at all of you, I say with confidence: Our combined military power is unmatched. Our strength-of-arms is unsurpassed. And I know our forces are ready to respond anytime, anywhere. And so today, to my fellow Americans serving here in Poland, I urge you, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief: Be vigilant. Do your duty. Mind your mission. And look after one another, even as you play a role in this vital alliance. And know that the American people and, I'm confident, the people of Poland are grateful to each and every one of you, and know they can count on each one of you every day. As I look out across this hangar, I see men and women in uniform, American and Polish. All of you have answered the call to put on the uniform, to count others' lives more important than your own, and to protect your families and ours, and to preserve freedom. Your burden is heavy, full of uncertainty, for as the Bible says, and we know, the ""soldier does not bear the sword in vain."" And so we know you are prepared. We do not know what challenges lie ahead, but we will be prepared. And I know I speak on behalf of my President and yours when I say that we have confidence that you will confront and overcome whatever tests and trials may arise, just as those who came before you did in their day. Because today, as in ages past, your commitment and ours is unwavering. Our courage is undiminished. And our spirit, in common cause for freedom, is unbreakable. So in the name of the heroes who came before, with confidence in all of you, and with faith in God, I know that, by your service and through this alliance, we will protect our people. We will defend our freedom. And together, we will forge a future of security, prosperity, and peace for Poland, the United States, and freedom-loving nations across the world for generations to come. So thank you for your service. God bless you. God bless Poland. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1322595/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-us-and-polish-armed-forces-of-the-33rd-air-base&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		Warsaw, Poland	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-u-s-polish-armed-forces-33rd-air-base-warsaw-poland/
VSMP1422019111	Mike Pence	2019-02-14	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Warsaw Ministerial Working Luncheon	speech	"Prime Minister Morawiecki, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Secretary Pompeo, Your Excellencies: It's an honor to join you for this first-ever ""Ministerial to Promote a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East,"" and I'm honored to be here with you all. As I begin, allow me to bring greetings , bring greetings from a friend to every nation gathered here and a champion of peace and security in the Middle East. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Two years ago, President Trump made his first overseas trip as President of the United States when he traveled to the Middle East. There, the President convened a historic gathering of leaders from 50 nations across the region at what was the Arab Islamic American Summit. As President Trump said at the time, in his words, ""The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance."" He challenged us to work together to meet, as he said, ""history's great test to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces"" of terrorism. And I'm here today on the President's behalf, standing before another unprecedented gathering of leaders from more than 50 nations, to say that the United States of America stands ready to work with all those gathered here to answer this great challenge and seize our shared destiny of peace. We each come from different nations and cultures. Our people speak different languages. They hold fast to different faiths, from the Abrahamic tradition and beyond. But all of us are united in our mission to forge a brighter future of security and prosperity in the Middle East. For decades, the people of the Middle East have suffered as their homelands have been destabilized and destroyed by security threats that remain with us today , from sectarian-fueled civil wars to murderous dictatorships. And just last night, for the first time in the history of the modern Middle East, representatives from nearly every major country sat down and openly and publicly discussed matters of joint concern. The United States and Poland welcome this outward symbol of cooperation as a hopeful sign of a brighter future that awaits the nations of the Middle East. We gather together today on the promise of a better tomorrow, and we gather together today because of the common threats that we face. And no threat is more dangerous or more urgent than radical Islamist terrorism and the authoritarian regimes that export it across the region and across the wider world. Radical Islamic terrorism knows no borders. It targets the United States, Israel, and nations across the Middle East and around the world. It respects no creed, stealing the lives of Christians, Jews, and Muslims. And radical Islamic terrorism understands no reality other than brute force. For nearly 200 years, stretching back to our Treaty of Amity and Commerce with Oman, the United States has been a force for good in the Middle East. Previous administrations in my country too often underestimated the danger that radical Islamic terrorism posed to the American people, our homeland, our allies, and our partners. Their inaction saw the terrorist attacks from the U.S.S. Cole; to September 11th; to the expansion of ISIS across Syria and Iraq , reaching all the way to the suburbs of Baghdad. But as the world has witnessed over the past two years, under President Trump, those days are over. Since day one, President Trump has restored American leadership on the world stage. And in implementing our National Security Strategy, we've taken decisive action to protect the American homeland, promote American prosperity, advance American interests, and preserve peace through strength. Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is once again putting the security and prosperity of America first. But as the past two years have shown, across the Middle East and across the wider world, ""America First"" does not mean America alone. And in the Middle East, the United States is working to build, as the President said, ""a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God."" And the winds of change can already be felt across the Middle East. Israel's prime minister openly visits Oman. Just last week, Pope Francis visited the United Arab Emirates. Longstanding enemies are becoming partners. Old foes are finding new ground for cooperation. And the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael are coming together in common cause as never before. This historic conference is a testament to the truth that a new era has begun. Together with our allies, the United States has brought the full force of our military to drive radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the Earth. We've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on their terms, on their soil, and on our terms. President Trump gave our commanders in the field the authority they needed to hit ISIS and drive them back. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and the efforts of our 78 coalition partners, we've liberated millions of people: Iraqis, Syrians, Arabs, Kurds, Muslims, Christians, men, women, and children. And very soon, the territory of the ISIS caliphate will be no more. In the wake of these gains, President Trump has announced that the United States will begin to hand off the fight to our partners in the region and to bring our troops home. This is a change in tactics, not a change in mission. The United States will keep a strong presence in the region. We recognize it will not be enough to simply reclaim the territory of the caliphate. As we enter this new phase, the United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of our allies and all those who step up to take a larger role in this campaign. And working with our coalition partners, we will continue to hunt down the remnants of ISIS wherever and whenever they rear their ugly head. And America will continue to stand strong with all our partners in the region to make the Middle East safe for peace, prosperity, and the advance of human rights. And under President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States of America remains fully committed to achieving a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. In Syria, President Trump used American military power, together with our French and British allies, to launch precision military strikes, responding to Syria's use of chemical nerve gas against its people. And the United States and our allies will never tolerate the use of chemical weapons against innocent men, women, and children. And we stand ready to deter any further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. With these actions and positions and many others, the United States has been strengthening old alliances and forging new partnerships. President Trump is a leader who seeks to lead the free world through strength. We will always stand with our allies and defend our values. The United States will never fail to stand with our ally, Israel. We will never fail to call out attacks on innocent civilians or a free and independent press, even as we continue to demand that all those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi be brought to justice. But we're here today because of what unites us: Our shared commitment to the advance of security, prosperity, and human rights in the Middle East , and our shared responsibility to confront the single greatest threat to that bright future. Last night was remarkable. At the outset of this historic conference, leaders from across the region agreed that the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East is the Islamic Republic of Iran. Forty years ago this month, the mullahs seized control of that country. And every year since, they've supported terrorist proxies and militias , Hezbollah and Hamas; exported missiles; fueled conflicts in Syria and Yemen and beyond. The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. They have bombed American embassies, murdered hundreds of American troops, and even to this day, they hold hostage citizens of the United States and other Western nations. Iran has brazenly defied United Nations sanctions, violated resolutions, and plotted terrorist attacks on European soil. As President Trump has said, ""The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people."" The authoritarian regime in Tehran represses the freedom of speech and assembly, it persecutes religious minorities, brutalizes women, executes gay people, and openly advocates the destruction of the State of Israel. The Ayatollah Khamenei himself has said, ""It is the mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to erase Israel from the map."" Later today, my wife and I will lay a wreath at the memorial to the Jewish fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto. And tomorrow, we will pay our solemn respects to the martyrs of the Holocaust as we make our first visit to Auschwitz. From the dark years of Nazi occupation, the people of Poland know all too well that anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism must be confronted, wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. But beyond its hateful rhetoric, the Iranian regime openly advocates another Holocaust and it seeks the means to achieve it. Iran seeks to recreate the ancient Persian Empire under the modern dictatorship of the ayatollahs. As we speak, that regime is attempting to carve out a corridor of influence running through Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, hoping to create an unbroken passage for its armies and its ideology. And it has left a trail of devastation in its wake. In Syria, Iranian troops have propped up the Assad regime, fueling the dictator's brutal war on his people. In Lebanon, Iran's proxy, Hezbollah, has built an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets and missiles, equipped with Iranian-supplied advanced guidance systems. In Yemen, Houthi rebels fire Iranian-made rockets as they wage war against the government, spreading chaos throughout the country. And in Iraq, Iranian-backed militias are operating outside of the Iraqi government's control , targeting American interests, threatening minorities, and stealing vital international aid meant to help Iraq recover from the scourge of ISIS. And of all Iran's meddling, it's only added fuel to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across the region. In Syria, more than 5.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes. In Yemen, more than a million people have contracted cholera, and millions more lack access to clean water. Hunger is so widespread that every ten minutes, a child dies an entirely preventable death. And in Iraq, even though the ISIS caliphate has been decimated, more than 1.8 million Iraqis still haven't returned to their homes. The plight of the oppressed in the Middle East , and the threat posed by their oppressors , has spurred the United States to action. Thanks to the courage of our armed forces, more than 5 million people are now free from the grip of ISIS. And with the generosity of the American people, the United States has provided more than $9 billion in humanitarian aid and civilian assistance to those affected by the multiple crises across the Middle East , more than any other nation on Earth. The United States of America has been a force for good in the Middle East. But under the mullahs' regime in Iran, for their people, it's been 40 years of corruption, 40 years of repression, 40 years of terror, and 40 years of failure. And for too long, America tried wishing away the dangers of a radical Islamism that is poisoning both of Islam's great Sunni and Shia streams; a radicalism that seeks to crush every form of dissent and divergence. The previous administrations' desire for peace at any price drove them to strike a devil's bargain with our common enemy , the enemy of our allies and partners in the Middle East. But since day one of this administration, President Trump promised to stand with the good people of Iran and stand up to their oppressors. And that's just what we've done. President Trump kept his word when he withdrew the United States of America from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action did not prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It merely delayed the day when that vile regime would gain access to the world's deadliest weapons. And remarkably, the universal view of those who spoke last night at this very conference was that Iran has actually become more aggressive since the JCPOA was signed, not less. The United States re-imposed sanctions that should never have been lifted in the first place and we've launched a new campaign to prevent the regime from financing its trademark terror and destruction around the world. And since then, the UAE has canceled its imports of Iranian condensate. Bahrain is exposing the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps proxies active in its country, and is working to stop Iran's illicit maritime activities in the region. And countries across the globe are working toward cutting Iranian oil imports to zero. But sadly, some of our leading European partners have not been nearly as cooperative. In fact, they've led the effort to create mechanisms to break up our sanctions. Just two weeks ago, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom announced the creation of a special financing mechanism designed to oversee a mirror-image transaction that would replace sanctionable international payments between EU businesses and Iran. They call this scheme a ""Special Purpose Vehicle."" We call it an effort to break American sanctions against Iran's murderous revolutionary regime. It's an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU, and create still more distance between Europe and the United States. Some argue that Iran is in technical compliance with the narrow terms of the deal. But compliance is not the issue; the deal is the issue. Today, America's economic sanctions on Iran are the toughest in history and will get tougher still unless and until Iran changes its dangerous and destabilizing behavior. As President Trump has said, ""There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction. Let it end now."" The time has come for our European partners to stand with us and the Iranian people; to stand with our allies and friends in the region. The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and join with us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure necessary to give the Iranian people, the region, and the world the peace, security, and freedom they deserve. We must not let this opportunity slip from our hands. In June 2009, after the Iranian regime stole an election to maintain its grip on power, the previous administration refused to raise its voice when the Iranian people took to the streets in what came to be known as the ""Green Movement."" It wasn't until the Congress acted that the United States declared its support for the Iranian people. As a member of Congress, it was my privilege to introduce a bipartisan resolution that passed overwhelmingly that showed the support of the American people, and only then did our administration follow. But soon, the ayatollahs and their henchmen used the cover of the world's timidity to murder, imprison, and terrify freedom-loving Iranians. The world missed an opportunity last time to confront the regime, but not this time. This time, all of us must stand strong. As Iran's economy continues to plummet, as the people of Iran take to the streets, freedom-loving nations must stand together to hold the Iranian regime accountable for the evil and violence it's inflicted on its people, on the region, and the wider world. So to all of you gathered here who share this vision for peace and security across the Middle East, I make you a promise on behalf of the President of the United States and the American people: If you stand with us in this noble cause, we will stand with you. Together, we will embrace a shared future, building on the best traditions of the past. It's remarkable to think that nearly 4,000 years ago, a man was called to leave his home in the Ur of the Chaldeans and make a long journey north. He wore no crown. He commanded no armies. He performed no miracles. He delivered no prophecies. Yet to him was promised, in those ancient words, ""descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky."" Today, Jews, Christians, and Muslims , more than half the population of the Earth and nearly all the people of the Middle East , claim Abraham as their forefather in faith. And so he is. And as we gather at this historic conference, I believe, on that foundation of that Abrahamic tradition, we can find a firm foundation for a brighter future for all the peoples and all the faiths of the Middle East. And it doesn't just simply have to be a part of our imagination. It's actually happening, even as we speak. We need look no further than the Old City of Jerusalem as an example of what could be true for the region as a whole. There, we see the followers of the three great religions in constant contact with one another. We see each faith come to life in new and renewed ways every day. At Haram al-Sharif, we see young Muslims' heads bowed in prayer. At the Church of the Sepulchre, we see a Christian child receiving the right of baptism. And at the Western Wall, we see a young Jewish boy being bar-mitzvahed. What we see there, we can achieve and live all across the Middle East. That's the vision that President Trump has. And that's the hope and aspiration of peace-loving people in our nation and around the world. So it's an honor to be with you all today. To all of Your Excellencies who are gathered here; and to our host country, Poland, we say thanks. Thank you all again for being here. And to all whoever doubt whether peace could at last come to the Middle East, I think we would do well to look to a promise that was made to that man I referred to who made that journey so many centuries ago. It was a promise in those ancient words, that ""I will surely bless you."" I believe with all my heart we can claim that blessing anew for all the people of this region and the world for ourselves and our posterity. If we claim it with faith and we claim it together, I believe God will surely bless us with peace. So let us begin. Thank you and God bless you. (Applause.)

VSMP1622019110	Mike Pence	2019-02-16	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2019 Munich Security Conference	speech	"Ambassador Ischinger, distinguished guests, it is my honor to join you for the 55th Annual Munich Security Conference. And I'm grateful for the warm welcome. I'm also honored to be joined by an extraordinary delegation of Americans, including Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, and a distinguished delegation of senators and representatives from the United States Congress, led by Senator Lindsey Graham. Would you join me in welcoming the largest American delegation in the history of the Munich Security Conference? (Applause.) It's an honor to be here with them and with Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Madam Speaker, my greetings to you. (Applause.) We're grateful for Senator Graham's leadership of this delegation and grateful for the strong bipartisan American presence represented here. To them and to all of you, it's my great honor to speak to you today, on behalf of a champion of freedom and a champion of a strong national defense, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Two years ago, I stood at this podium and I told you that America's leadership in the free world would not falter, not even for a moment, and that America first did not mean America alone. Later that same year, standing where we stood just a few short days ago, beside the Monument to the Warsaw Uprising, after reaffirming the United States' firm commitment to NATO and our mutual defense, President Trump spoke these words: He said, quote, ""The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive."" He went on to say, ""Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?"" Today, as Vice President of the United States, I'm proud to report, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States has answered that question , not merely with words but with actions. And today, America is stronger than ever before, and America is leading on the world stage once again. (Applause.) With the support of strong bipartisan majorities in the United States Congress, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still, enacting the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We released a National Security Strategy advancing peace through American strength. We initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. And just last month, President Trump unveiled our nation's new strategy for missile defense. A strong military, of course, depends on a strong economy. And under this President, we've taken decisive action to strengthen the American economy. We enacted the largest tax cuts and tax reforms in American history, rolled back regulation at a record pace, forged reciprocal trade deals, and unleashed American energy as never before. And the results for our country have been remarkable. In just over two years, our nation has created 5.3 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate has reached its lowest point in nearly 50 years. Our stock market is soaring to new heights. And we've become the world's largest producer of oil and gas. With this renewed American strength, both military and economic, President Trump has also been leading our NATO Allies to renew their commitment to our common defense. And we've seen extraordinary progress. At President Trump's urging, in the past two years, the number of NATO members spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense has doubled, and the majority of NATO members now have plans in place to meet their financial obligations by 2024. As Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said, thanks to President Trump's leadership, NATO has seen, quote, ""real money and real results."" When I was at this conference two years ago, I remember a meeting I had with a leader of one of our NATO Allies. He was very candid with me. He told me he was worried that our new administration might represent a moment where America would pull back from our commitments. I remember he said that Europe needed America to be the leader of the free world. I told him I respected his opinion and I appreciated his candor. And then, I told him that when you hear President Trump ask our NATO Allies to live up to the commitments they've made to our common defense, that's what we call being leader of the free world. The truth is, many of our NATO Allies still need to do more. And the United States expects every NATO member to put in place a credible plan to meet the 2 percent threshold. And, by 2024, we expect all our allies to invest 20 percent of defense spending on procurement. With that renewed strength, America and our allies have stood strong. We've stood against efforts, as well, to divide our alliance through political interference or the use of energy resources. And the United States commends all our European partners who've taken a strong stand against Nord Stream 2. And we commend others to do the same. We've also made it clear that we will not stand idly by while NATO Allies purchase weapons from our adversaries. We cannot ensure the defense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East. The United States has also been very clear with our security partners on the threat posed by Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies, as Chinese law requires them to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their network or equipment. We must protect our critical telecom infrastructure, and America is calling on all our security partners to be vigilant and to reject any enterprise that would compromise the integrity of our communications technology or our national security systems. And so, with President Trump's leadership and a clear focus on our security, our transatlantic alliance is being defended and renewed. And with that renewed strength, we've taken the fight to radical Islamist terrorists on our terms, on their soil. In Iraq and Syria, President Trump gave American commanders in the field the authority they needed to hit ISIS and drive them back. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and the efforts of our 78 coalition partners, the ISIS caliphate has been decimated, and our troops , (applause) , have liberated 5 million Iraqis, Syrians, Arabs, Kurds, and Muslims , men, women, and children. As I stand before you today, at this very hour, along the Euphrates River, the last mile of territory where the black flag of ISIS once flew is being captured. In the wake of these gains, President Trump has announced that the United States will begin to hand off the fight to our partners in the region and to bring our troops home. But this is a change in tactics, not a change in mission. The United States will keep a strong presence in the region. We recognize it will not be enough to simply reclaim the territory of the caliphate. As we enter this new phrase phase, the United States will continue to work with all our allies to hunt down the remnants of ISIS wherever and whenever they rear their ugly head. (Applause.) Beyond Iraq and Syria, in the fall of 2017, President Trump announced our South Asia strategy. And with a renewed commitment of United States Armed Forces and our NATO Allies, we've taken the fight with renewed vigor to the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS Khorasan, and other Islamic extremist groups in Afghanistan. And thanks to their courageous efforts, the Taliban has come to the table and are in negotiations to reach a lasting political settlement that could bring peace and ensure that Afghanistan is never again used by terrorists to launch attacks against the United States, our allies, or any sovereign nation. Under President Donald Trump, the United States will seize every opportunity to achieve peace. But we will approach every challenge with our eyes wide open. We will deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. For instance, under President Trump, we've been holding Russia accountable for its attempts to redraw international borders by force, approving the largest defense sale to Ukraine in years. The United States has expelled 60 diplomats following a chemical weapons attack on a Russian exile on British soil. And after years of Russian violations of our decades-old treaty, the United States announced plans to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We've also taken decisive steps to confront the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Iran has supported terrorist proxies and militias, Hezbollah and Hamas; exported missiles; fueled conflicts in Syria and Yemen; plotted terrorist attacks on European soil; and openly advocated the destruction of the State of Israel. Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism must be confronted wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. (Applause.) Yesterday, my wife Karen and I paid our solemn respects to the martyrs of the Holocaust in our very first visit to Auschwitz. It was a scene of unspeakable tragedy but also a scene that marks the triumph of freedom. As a close friend whose grandparents survived the Holocaust said to me, as we walked those grounds , the grounds of the Birkenau camp , he whispered, ""Good always triumphs over evil."" And so it did, but at horrendous cost. One lesson of that dark chapter of human history is that when authoritarian regimes breathe out vile anti-Semitic hatred and threats of violence, we must take them at their word. The Iranian regime openly advocates another Holocaust and it seeks the means to achieve it. The Ayatollah Khamenei himself has said, ""It is the mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to erase Israel from the map."" Two years ago, President Trump made his first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia, where he convened a historic gathering of leaders from 50 nations across the region at the Arab Islamic American Summit. As President Trump said then, and I quote, ""The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance."" He challenged the nations gathered there to work together, as he said, to meet ""history's great test to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces"" of terrorism. This week, it was our privilege to travel to Poland to meet with many of those same leaders who came together around that great purpose. We gathered to discuss our mutual commitment to confront Iran and make the Middle East safe for peace, prosperity, and the advance of human rights. It was remarkable to see leaders from across the region agreeing that the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East is the Islamic Republic of Iran. As I said at that gathering, the time has come for all of us to act. The time has come for our European partners to stop undermining U.S. sanctions against this murderous revolutionary regime. The time has come for our European partners to stand with us and with the Iranian people, our allies and friends in the region. The time has come from our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and join us as we bring the economic and diplomatic pressure necessary to give the Iranian people, the region, and the world the peace, security, and freedom they deserve. (Applause.) So while we're standing with our allies, strengthening NATO, and standing up to aggression, President Trump's leadership is also bringing about historic change in the Indo-Pacific. The United States seeks an Indo-Pacific where independent nations boldly pursue their own interests, respecting their neighbors as equals; where societies, beliefs, and traditions flourish side by side; where individuals exercise their God-given liberties to pursue their dreams and chart their destinies. But as President Trump has said, for years the United States has faced ""tremendous tariffs"" in our trading relations with China. Those actions have contributed to a $375 billion goods trade deficit with the United States last year alone. To address that, at the President's direction, the United States has taken decisive action. We've put tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and made it clear that we could more than double that number. But as President Trump has made clear, we hope for better.As we gather here, negotiations are underway in Beijing to redefine our trading relationship. And our negotiations are not simply about the trade imbalance. Under President Trump's leadership, the United States has also made it clear that China must address the longstanding issues of intellectual-property theft, forced technology transfer, and other structural issues in China that have placed a burden on our economy and on economies around the world. President Trump has great respect for President Xi, and so do I. And the President remains hopeful that, as those negotiations continue, we'll be able to make real progress and establishing trade between our two countries that is free, fair, and reciprocal. Now, other issues will remain: the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, debt diplomacy, interference in domestic political affairs, and the rights of religious minorities in China. And Beijing knows where we stand. And while America will keep standing strong, we'll also keep remaining hopeful, as these discussions continue, that we'll be able to take this first step to redefine our relationship based on reciprocity and mutual respect, and in so doing, make it possible to address other issues to the benefit of the United States and China, and the world. China has an honored place in our vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific if it chooses to respect its neighbors' sovereignty; embrace free, fair, and reciprocal trade; and uphold human rights and freedom. The American people want nothing more, and the Chinese people and the entire Indo-Pacific deserve nothing less. In one other respect, it's remarkable to think how far we've come under President Trump's leadership in the Indo-Pacific. When I stood at this podium two years ago, North Korea was engaged in regular nuclear tests, launching missiles over Japan, and threatening the United States and our allies. Faced with this threat, President Trump rallied the world around an unprecedented pressure campaign. And the world has witnessed the results: No more nuclear tests. No more missiles being fired. Our hostages are home. And Karen and I had the privilege to be present in Hawaii as the remains of our fallen Korean War heroes began to come home. And then, last year, at their historic summit in Singapore, President Trump received a commitment from Chairman Kim to achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. Now, as we speak, President Trump is preparing for another summit with Chairman Kim in Vietnam in just a few weeks. And, again, President Trump is hopeful. He believes peace is possible. But our allies may be assured: We will not repeat the mistakes of the past. All nations must continue to stand together, enforce all U.N. Security Council resolutions, and hold North Korea to the commitments it made in the Singapore declaration. And I can promise you, America will as well. And while we work for peace, we will continue to stand firm until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea. We owe it to our children, to the Indo-Pacific, and to the world. And so while the challenges before us loom large, with renewed American leadership on the world stage, together we're demonstrating every day that we can make the future of the free world brighter than ever before. And as we rise to meet these challenges in the days ahead, we should never underestimate our power to change the world for the better. For when we're strong and when we're united, there's nothing we can't achieve together. In recent weeks, we've seen what happens when the free world and freedom-loving people unite around a single cause, as so many of the nations represented in this room have stood with us, and shoulder to shoulder with the Venezuelan people, in their struggle to reclaim their libertad. The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy. Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go. Maduro's socialism has shrunk their economy by nearly half. More than 9 out of 10 people live in poverty, in what was once one of the wealthiest countries in our hemisphere. The average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition. Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving at this very hour. And rising desperation has fueled a mass exodus. More than 3 million Venezuelans have abandoned their beloved country. And if things don't get better, another 2 million are expected to follow them out before the end of this year. Karen and I saw the hardship facing families in Venezuela firsthand when we traveled through the region last year. We met with families in a little church in Manaus, Brazil. And the compassion of that faith community and the compassion of the world was meeting the needs of people fleeing tyranny and deprivation. We spent time with those families. We hugged their children. We heard of their hardship and their plight. And I'll , I'll never forget the father, standing beside his wife and two little boys, who told me how hard it was after a long day's work to return home and look your little children in the eye, and tell them, ""We're not going to eat today."" It is a tragedy that demands a response from the whole world. Fortunately, as we gather, freedom is breaking out in Venezuela. (Applause.) This week, Interim President Juan Guaidó and his government hosted an international humanitarian conference at the Organization of American States, where 30 nations recommitted themselves to supporting the Venezuelan people and providing relief. Responding to this call, the international community has already pledged over $100 million in humanitarian assistance. And in the days ahead, the people of Venezuela will again take to the streets to raise their voices on behalf of democracy and the rule of law. At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first country in the world to recognize Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate President. To date, 52 nations, including 30 of our European allies, have followed America's lead. But it's time for the rest of the world to step forward. Once more, the Old World can take a stand in support of freedom in the New World. All of us must stand with the Venezuelan people until freedom and democracy is fully restored. So today, we call on the European Union to step forward for freedom and recognize Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate President of Venezuela. (Applause.) And so, under President Donald Trump's leadership, America is leading the free world once again. Thank you for the honor of participating in this important event. And thank you for this opportunity to reflect on the progress that we've made and the ties that unite freedom-loving people everywhere. As President Trump said in that very same Poland speech in 2017, ""Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory."" And they also depend on a foundation of faith. And on that faith, I know, as the President concluded, in his words, ""The West will never ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive. And our civilization will triumph."" For I have faith in our people and in freedom-loving people everywhere. And I also have that faith, in those ancient words, that where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. And when we hold fast to our faith in freedom and its eternal Author, freedom always wins. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

VSMP2122019109	Mike Pence	2019-02-21	Remarks by Vice President Pence After Touring an Opportunity Zone	speech	"(Laughs.) Record must have skipped. (Laughter.) Thank you, all. Thank you for the warm welcome. Please be seated. It is a real joy to be with each and every one of you. And to Bishop Freeman, and to all of the wonderful people at the Meeting Place Church , he told me 19 years ago he had a Bible and a barstool and three people, and now you are transforming this community for your members and for everyone in [northeast] Columbia. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. We're just so inspired by the example of the Meeting Place Church. And I want to thank you all for coming out today. Thanks for coming out and helping us all collectively celebrate what Columbia and what South Carolina are doing in partnership with local businesses, in partnership with this great ministry, and in partnership with leaders at the state and local level. It's truly inspiring. And I'm here with some of my favorite people. Chief among them is my wife of 33 years. She's a Marine Corps mom. She's an advocate for military families and spouses all across the nation. And she actually teaches art at a Christian school. Bishop, my wife, Karen Pence, is with us today, the Second Lady of the United States. (Applause.) She had to be here. And it's also a real joy , I think you can probably tell from the way we talk about each other , the bond that I have come to share with your senator. I first met him when he was a state legislator and I had made my way down to South Carolina. I sensed his quality. I sensed his integrity and his faith from the first time that we spoke. Little did I know that we would serve together in the United States House of Representatives. And you can imagine how inspired I was to see him take his role and be reelected as the junior senator for the great state of South Carolina. Would you stand up and join me in thanking Senator Tim Scott for his presence and his great leadership? (Applause.) I can honestly say I was for Tim Scott before it was cool. (Laughter.) And I hope you people in South Carolina know that his leadership inspires not only people all across this state, not only in Washington, D.C., but all across the nation. And we're all grateful for your support for him. And as we get started today , speaking of friends of mine, let me bring greetings from another friend of mine. The Senator and I spoke to him on the way here, and he was excited to hear that we were coming to see one of the Opportunity Zones that he signed into law become a reality. I bring greetings from a great champion of opportunity for every American, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I was excited to be here with you today, and particularly to be here this month, to see the way this community is pulling together the extraordinary entrepreneurial energy that's gathered here, the way your political leadership at the national level has rallied around making new opportunities available for people all across northeastern Columbia. And it's also meaningful to be here, in this community, particularly since it's Black History Month. It's a month, each and every year, where Americans pause to celebrate the extraordinary accomplishments and contributions of African Americans to the life of this nation, from business to the arts, to sciences, to politics, to armed forces, to law enforcement, and every field and endeavor. As President Trump said in issuing his proclamation this year, and I quote, ""The examples of heroism, patriotism, and enterprise"" of African Americans throughout our history ""have given people of all backgrounds courage, confidence, and faith to pursue their dreams."" And we celebrate Black History Month with all of you. (Applause.) And in this time, it's incredibly exciting to be here not only, Bishop, to see the growth in this community, but to see a growing American economy. It's inspiring to think that, since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small have created 5.3 million new jobs all across the United States. Wages are rising at a faster pace than any time in decades. They're growing fastest for blue-collar workers across the country. And in this rising economy, in just two years, nearly 5 million Americans have lifted themselves off food stamps. This economy is growing. (Applause.) And it's the result of the energy of our people and the policies we've advanced. And South Carolina is no exception to this boom. South Carolina has added nearly 80,000 jobs over the last two years, and South Carolina is now enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in the history of the great state of South Carolina. (Applause.) And it is incredible to see it. But as Senator Scott knows, and I expect many of you appreciate, it's been a result of , not of good timing, but it's been a result of good policies from the outset of this administration, under President Trump's leadership, with your senator's strong support. We've been cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy, negotiating better and fairer trade deals, opening up opportunities for American exports as never before. And in the midst of all of those reforms, we passed legislation that included what has come to be known as ""Opportunity Zones"" that's expanding opportunities here in northeast Columbia and all across America. And Senator TimScott was the champion of this transformational reform. (Applause.) It's true. One of the things Senator Scott and I bonded on early on is our affinity for a guy by the name of Jack Kemp, who was a mentor of mine. And he actually was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the first Bush administration. And it was then that he first began to talk about this concept. But your senator managed to bring it to the floor of the United States Senate. And when tax reform rolled through the Congress of the United States , historic tax reform , I mean to tell you, he was in there every step of the way making sure that when tax reform would come, that it would benefit every American and every community. And, Senator Tim Scott, this community, this state, and this nation are in your debt. Thank you so much. (Applause.) Opportunity Zones , those of you not fully aware , are areas of the country that for too long have been left behind. Many of the nearly 35 million Americans who live in these places still struggle to find work, to make ends meet. Tim and I were talking on the way here of a time that we had both traveled to Philadelphia. We were there for a conference. We were both members of Congress, and , but we were in inner-city Philadelphia, and so we made a time to stop by a local ministry , a homeless shelter. And I'll just never forget the conversation that I had with an African American man, about my age. I remember he looked at me, and he said, ""Mike, you know, it's just not like it was when you and I were growing up."" And I said, ""Well, how do you mean?"" And he just looked , he looked at me and he just said, ""Well, you know, when I was growing up,"" he said, ""sure, there were some people that didn't want to work, but you could always find a job if you wanted one."" But he looked at me and he said , in 2010, he looked at me and said, ""There's just no jobs."" He said, ""Young people today are faced with a lack of opportunity, not a lack of will."" And I have to tell you, we reflected on that experience. And to see the progress that we've been making in our economy, broadly, but also in this transformational idea of Opportunity Zones, it's all about making sure that, as the American economy expands, it's going to expand for every American. And that's exactly what we've done here. This program encourages private new investment in areas that start business, rebuild infrastructure, unlock hidden potential. And not like I need to tell the people of this area anything about that, because the men and women of this great congregation and businesses in the area have come together for one of the very first Opportunity Zones to roll out in America since this legislation was signed into law. And after 11 years of abandonment, the Capital 8 theater is a reality. And it's creating jobs and opportunity and energy in this growing community. (Applause.) I mean, it is amazing to me, Bishop, to think about , think about what you've accomplished here. And the leaders of this church saw that potential and saw the opportunity to put people to work, but also to create a magnet , a magnet for more investment in this area, bringing people into the community and bringing new businesses into the community, and rebuilding it bigger and better than ever before. The truth is, Opportunity Zones help address unique needs by forming partnerships between the federal government with regard to tax benefits, state and local leaders, and local investors to create that incentive that makes it even more possible for people to invest at the point of the need. As President Trump said just a few months ago, when he established what came to be known as the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council , which is going to be coordinating efforts and identifying Opportunity Zones all across the country , as the President said, and I quote, ""No citizen will be forgotten, no community will be ignored no American will be left on the sidelines."" We ""must unlock the potential of all our people, not just some of our people."" And that's what Opportunity Zones are doing right here in Columbia. (Applause.) The generosity and the dedication, the ingenuity, the entrepreneurial spirit , and not only of Bishop Freeman and this great congregation, but of the businesses that are represented here , is truly inspiring. You know, one of my wife Karen's favorite verses is that verse that speaks about how the Lord says He waits in Heaven, ready to pour out blessings , to pour out blessings on His people, until you won't have room enough to take it all in. And I truly do believe, looking at what's happening here, looking at this spectacular facility and the banquet facility, and the theaters that have come together, and looking at the businesses that are coming back to this region, that those blessings have just begun , just begun for northeast Columbia. And the truth is, after years of a neighborhood that's been struggling, and because of the vision that Senator Scott brought here, because of the ingenuity and determination of this great community, you're all coming back. But I know there's one other reason that I leave here with a tremendous amount of confidence and enthusiasm about what I've seen, and that's because not only do you have the business acumen to bring this region of northeast Columbia back, not only do you have public officials that understand how to create incentives that will create jobs and opportunities for every American in every community, not only do you have the strong public support, but also it's evident to me everywhere I've gone, since I arrived here at this place, is the faith of the people in this community. It radiates from everybody I've spoken to. (Applause.) And it's deeply inspiring. And the truth is, you know, unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain. And I know that you all are building on a foundation of faith here. And it's on that foundation that, throughout our nation's history, it's always been on that solid foundation that we've been able to bring people together , to bring people together around the point of the need to ensure that opportunities and blessings reach everyone in our community. And so I want to thank you for your inspiring example. Mr. Freeman, I want to thank you for your warm hospitality today and for the inspirational example of the Meeting Place Church. Senator Scott, I want to thank you for your tenacious advocacy of Opportunity Zones as we debated tax reform just a few years ago. And lastly, I just want to thank all of you here across the Columbia community and across South Carolina who are gathered here to really celebrate what is great, great progress. But I think it's just the beginning, because I really do believe that with the strong leadership of President Trump, Senator Scott, and your other representatives in both parties in Washington, D.C. championing policies that create opportunities for all; with your strong state and local leadership; with this great business community with such large hearts and generous spirits; and with a community of faith; and with God's help, the best days for northeast Columbia, for South Carolina, and America are yet to come. And they'll be days of opportunity for all. Thank you very much. God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP2522019108	Mike Pence	2019-02-25	Remarks by Vice President Pence to the Lima Group	speech	"President Duque; President Varela; President Morales; and especially the Interim President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, President Juan Guaidó; Vice President Mourão; Your Excellencies: It's an honor to address this gathering today at a momentous hour for the people of Venezuela and for the progress of freedom in this hemisphere. And before I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of freedom, of liberty, in Venezuela and across this hemisphere. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Just days ago, as the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen burned truckloads of food and medicine, and murdered civilians. Saturday was a tragic day for the families of those who lost their lives. And we mourn with those who mourn. It was also a tragic day for the suffering people of Venezuela. But it was also just one more day in Venezuela's long and inevitable journey from tyranny to freedom. As President Trump said one week ago today, so I say to all of you: Despite the brutality that the world witnessed this weekend, ""a new day is coming in Latin America In Venezuela and across the Western Hemisphere, socialism is dying, and liberty, prosperity, and democracy are being reborn"" before our eyes. And, President Guaidó, President Donald Trump asked me to be here today to deliver a simple message to you and to the people of Venezuela: Estamos con ustedes. We are with you 100 percent. We stand with you in America, along with all the nations gathered here today, and we will keep standing with you until democracy and your libertad are restored. As President Trump said, in his words, ""There will be no [turning] back."" And the events of the last two days have only steeled our resolve. Two years ago, leaders from 12 nations across the Western Hemisphere gathered in Peru and took a bold stand for freedom when they signed the Lima Declaration and created this group that now bears its name. The Lima Group has proudly led hemispheric efforts to call out the Maduro regime for its slide into dictatorship. And today, thanks in large part to the leadership represented here today, more than 50 nations have joined us in recognizing Interim President Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate President of Venezuela. You've heard the voices of Venezuelan patriots crying out for freedom. You've supported their courageous effort to face down the brutal dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. And for that, to all those gathered here, I say you have the thanks and the greatest respect of the United States of America, and I know you have the gratitude of the Venezuelan people. To the countries represented here today, and especially to our friends, Colombia and Brazil, the United States is grateful for the way you've stepped forward to help the Venezuelan people in their hour of need. President Duque, your country has accepted more than a million Venezuelans with open arms and fought the drug smugglers, gangs, and human traffickers that have overrun your sister republic. And for your country's leadership, you have the deepest gratitude of the United States. And let me take this opportunity to say to all those who would threaten our friend for taking a bold stand in defense of democracy in Venezuela, know this: Colombia is our strongest partner in the region, and any who would threaten her sovereignty or security would do well not to test the commitment to our ally or the resolve of the United States of America. Vice President Mourão, as I saw firsthand in Manaus, the Brazilian people as well, have shown great compassion in providing aid to the Venezuelan people. And that compassion was, again, on display this weekend in the midst of the tragic events that unfolded before the eyes of world. And you have our thanks. What brings us together today is the recognition, by all the nations gathered here, that Nicolas Maduro is a usurper with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go. The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, between oppression and freedom, between the suffering of millions of Venezuelans and the opportunity for a ""new future"" of freedom and prosperity. It was utterly unconscionable that Maduro blocked hundreds of tons of aid from reaching impoverished people across Venezuela. But he literally danced while truckloads of aid with food and medicine burned. The reality is that, today, more than 9 out of 10 people in Venezuela live in poverty. The average Venezuelan has lost 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition, and the economy has shrunk by half. Thousands of children are starving this very hour. And, for months, food, medicine, and other supplies provided by the United States and our allies across this hemisphere have piled up along the border, even as Maduro sent aid to his puppet masters in Cuba. The Venezuelan people continue to suffer deprivation. By contrast, the Venezuelan people's true leader took decisive action to put an end to their suffering. Interim President Juan Guaidó issued a direct order to the armed forces of Venezuela to allow all humanitarian aid to enter the country on Saturday, February 23rd. And he called on the Venezuelan people to show their resolve by holding peaceful protests outside military bases across the country. In response, thousands of Venezuelans gathered outside La Carlota Air Base in Caracas to raise their voices in support of liberty. And many of the military's rank-and-file showed their loyalty when they refused to fire on their fellow countrymen. So far, nearly 200 members of the armed forces of Venezuela have chosen to stand with the citizens of Venezuela, and defected from the Maduro regime. And even in the midst of the tragic events of this last Saturday, some aid was able to cross the border into Venezuela from Brazil. As one of the servicemen who defected to President Guaidó's government said this weekend, and I quote, ""It's millions versus 30 or so of them."" Thirty usurpers must not be allowed to deny liberty to 30 million people. As President Trump has said, ""The fight for freedom has begun."" But Maduro's loyalists turned on their own people. As the world watched, they set fire to trucks loaded with food and medicine desperately needed by the Venezuelan people. Cuban-trained thugs in ski masks, known as ""colectivos,"" went roaming about border towns, shooting randomly at innocent civilians. More than 300 people were injured, and at least five Venezuelans lost their lives, including members of the Pemon indigenous tribe. What we've seen in the last two days wasn't a bold stroke by a triumphant leader; it was the desperate act of a tyrant clinging to power with violence and intimidation. Since day one of this administration, I'm pleased to report that the United States has recognized the threat that Nicolas Maduro posed to the Venezuelan people and to nations across the region, including ours. And our administration has taken decisive action to stand with the people of Venezuela as they seek to reclaim their freedom. The United States has imposed sanctions on more than 50 top officials, as well as on Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, to stop Maduro's cronies from enrichening themselves at the expense of the Venezuelan people. Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly in 2017 and in 2018, President Trump called on all nations to stand with us in condemning and isolating Maduro's dictatorship. And on January 23rd, when the Venezuelan people took to the streets to march for freedom and democracy, the United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Juan Guaidó as the rightful President of Venezuela. It's been my honor to travel to Latin America five times, on the President's behalf, to strengthen the coalition of support for a free Venezuela, to strengthen the ties that bind freedom-loving people all across this hemisphere. And I'm proud to report that America has kept our promise to stand with the suffering people of Venezuela. We've stood with resolve and generosity, and so we will continue to stand. Under President Trump's leadership, the United States has provided more than $139 million in aid to the people of Venezuela already , the most of any nation on Earth. Just in the last two weeks, we've sent five military transport aircraft with 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil. And as President Duque and I discussed today, our efforts to date will not only continue, they will be increased. Despite Maduro's brutality, we will press on. As we speak, we are identifying new areas along the border where we can pre-position additional aid for the struggling people of Venezuela. Today, also, it's my privilege to announce that the United States will provide an additional $56 million to support our partners in the region as you come to the aid of the Venezuelan people fleeing from the deprivation and oppression of the Maduro regime. In the days and weeks ahead, the United States will continue to deliver life-saving food for the hungry, medicine for the desperately ill, and shelter for those displaced by the brutality and deprivation of the regime. And while we stand with the Venezuelan people, we will also continue to stand up to all of those who would oppress them. Many of your countries , such as Panama, Canada, and Colombia , have frozen the assets of military officials still loyal to Maduro, and we commend their action. These are important steps , cutting off the regime from the millions that they've stolen from the Venezuelan people , and we urge other freedom-loving countries to do the same. But as we stand here today, for all that we have done before, it's time to do more. Many of your countries have pledged to crack down on the regime's money-laundering and other corrupt activities, and to cut off the worst offenders from the financial system completely. As the people of Venezuela take to the streets to reclaim their liberty, it's time to make good on those promises. And so, today, with great respect, the United States calls on all the nations gathered here to intensify efforts to deny the Maduro regime access to financing and take the following actions to isolate the Maduro dictatorship. First, we call on all Lima Group nations to immediately freeze the assets of PDVSA. Second, we urge you to transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets in your country from the Maduro's henchmen to President Guaidó's government, and to do so immediately. We also urge all nations present to restrict visas for Maduro's inner circle, and vote to recognize President Guaidó's representative at the Inter-American Development Bank. These are important steps that the members of the Lima Group should endorse today and your nation should implement tomorrow. It's time. And to support you in these efforts, at President Trump's direction, effective today, the United States will impose additional sanctions on regime officials, including three border-state governors implicated in last weekend's violence and a member of Maduro's inner circle. These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests while their tyrant danced in Caracas. Their actions will not go unpunished. In the days ahead as well, the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime's corrupt financial networks. We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they've stolen and work to return it to the Venezuelan people. As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy. But as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table. And to those members of Venezuela's armed forces who continue to back Maduro, I have a message from the President of the United States. In words he first spoke one week ago, I say to the members of Venezuela's armed forces: ""You can choose to accept President Guaidó's generous offer of amnesty, to live your life in peace with your families and your countrymen."" But if you ""choose the other path: continuing to support Maduro,"" you ultimately will be held accountable. And as the President said one week ago to those same military, ""You will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out. You will lose everything."" President Guaidó does not seek retribution against you, but to be clear, neither does the United States of America. To all of those in the armed forces of Venezuela today, we say: If you take up the banner of democracy, President Guaidó's government and the United States government will welcome your support and grant relief from the sanctions that have been placed. Now, we know that what's holding many of you back is not loyalty to Maduro, but fear , fear for your families whom Cuban-trained secret police have kept under constant surveillance. But the truth is, after years of oppression and poverty, after this weekend's unspeakable brutality, Maduro's regime grows weaker by the day. So again, to those members of the Venezuelan armed forces, for yourselves, for your families, for your country, we say: Make the right choice. Accept President Guaidó's sincere offer of amnesty and an inclusive transition to democracy. As President Trump said last week, ""Now is the time for all Venezuelan patriots to act together as one united people."" And so it is. And to the leaders around the world, we also say, ""It's time."" There can be no bystanders in Venezuela's struggle for freedom. The United States calls on every freedom-loving nation in this hemisphere , including Mexico, Uruguay, and the nations of the eastern Caribbean , to join with us in recognizing Interim President Juan Guaidó and his government, and join us by stepping forward to support the Venezuelan people's struggle to reclaim their libertad. And to those nations that have been supporting the Maduro regime, in the wake of the brutality that the world witnessed this weekend, we urge you to reconsider. Reconsider your support for the tyrant. Join nations around the world to stand with the Venezuelan people. Withdraw your support for the Maduro regime. Those who continue to endorse this regime will only isolate themselves further on the world stage. We gather here to reaffirm our commitment to freedom in this hemisphere. And as President Trump said, ""The people of Venezuela are standing up for freedom and democracy, and the United States of America is standing right by their side."" As the people of Venezuela prepare to take to the streets again, we say, from our hearts, to the freedom-loving people of Venezuela: Know that you do not go alone. You go with the support and the prayers of the American people, the people of the nations gathered here, and with freedom-loving people all across the world. And I also believe that, as you stand for freedom, you go with the grace of the author of freedom who said, in those ancient words, ""Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."" Freedom springs from the hearts of all the people across this new world. And as Simón Bolívar said, ""A people that loves freedom will in the end be free."" And with faith in that great promise and in all who have joined us in the cause of freedom in Venezuela, faith in the resolve of our President and the American people, and faith in the courage and strength of the Venezuelan people and those who have stepped forward for her freedom, I believe with all my heart the day is coming soon when Venezuela's long nightmare will end, when Venezuela will once more be free, when her people will see a ""new birth of freedom"" in a nation reborn to libertad. To the good people of Venezuela: Seek your freedom. We will go with you. You go with God. Vayan con Dios.

VSMP262201920	Mike Pence	2019-02-26	Remarks by Vice President Pence During Visit with Venezuelan Migrant Families	statement	VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you all for taking time to meet with us. And I'm here to say, on behalf of the people of the United States of America: We are with you, and we will stay with you until your libertad is restored. The American people are proud to work with Colombia to provide assistance to you and your families as you fled from the oppression and the deprivation that has fallen upon Venezuela. The people of the United States will continue to support you and your families. But we will also stand strong with the only legitimate President of Venezuela, President Juan Guaidó. So I encourage you to have faith. Have faith in this courageous family and all the leaders for freedom in Venezuela that they represent. Have faith that, under President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States of America and freedom-loving nations around the world will stand with you. And have faith that you will someday go home and that Venezuela will one day be free. I believe it with all of my heart. For where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. PARTICIPANTS: Amen. (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT: With that, it's my great honor to stand here with the Interim President of Venezuela, President Juan Guaidó.

VSMP532019107	Mike Pence	2019-03-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the National Association of Manufacturers Board of Directors Meeting	speech	"Well, thank you, David. Thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you all for the warm welcome. It is good to be with you. To Governor Ducey, to Jay Timmons, to business leaders, distinguished guests: It is my honor and privilege to be back with one of the most remarkable organizations in America that's been leading innovation, creating opportunity, and pursuing progress since 1895: the National Association of Manufacturers. Thank you for having me at this 2019 Board Meeting. (Applause.) And as I get started, I know you've had a busy couple of days, and I wanted, nevertheless, to begin by bringing greetings from a friend of mine , a businessman who now is in a different line of work but I know has made a great connection to all of you in this room and to business leaders around the country. I want to bring you greetings from a man whose leadership has helped bring American manufacturing back. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I want to also ask you to join me in thanking a great leader in our administration. He's been a champion for manufacturers and hardworking entrepreneurs all across America. I know you've already heard from her at this 2019 Board Meeting, but join me in thanking Linda McMahon, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, for her great work for American jobs and opportunities. Thank you, Linda. (Applause.) We got a lot to talk about today. But before I begin, allow me to address the tragedy that was caused by more than 30 tornadoes that ripped through Alabama, Georgia, and Florida this past Sunday. I know the families of that region are on the hearts of everyone here, as they are on the hearts of every American. We mourn the 23 lives that were lost in Alabama, and our prayers are with the more than 30 people who are still missing, and the families of all of those affected by these terrible storms. At the direction of President Trump, FEMA has already deployed teams to Alabama and Georgia. And I can assure you they will continue to assist state and local search-and-rescue operations until we find and recover all who are missing. Our administration is in constant contact with state and local officials. The President and I have both spoken to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. The governor has now requested a major disaster declaration, and the President will soon sign it into effect. But to all of those who have been impacted by these tornadoes, let say to each and every one of you, not just on behalf of our administration but on behalf of all of the American people: We are with you. We stand with you. And we will stay with you until you recover bigger and better than ever before. That's our solemn promise. So thank you for that. But today, I'm here simply to say thanks to the great leaders in this room. Thanks to the leaders in the National Association of Manufacturers. It's amazing to think, for more than 120 years, this association has served faithfully as a champion of America's manufacturers in the halls of Washington, D.C. and in state capitols around the country. You have promoted pro-growth, pro-jobs policies that have benefitted American workers and American jobs for generations. And thanks to NAM and your leadership, American manufacturing is back in 2019. (Applause.) It's true. The men and women in this room are not only a testament to the difference that you can make in the public square when you advance free-market principles but you also , you also really personify the American Dream. You represent the success of American manufacturing. And the stories in this room are too numerous to recount from one podium. But let me mention a few, of people like Charles Sukup, the President of Sukup Manufacturing in Sheffield, Iowa. His father, Eugene, founded the company more than a half a century ago with little more than an idea to dry corn a little bit faster. I had the privilege to meet Charles and his family just two years ago. And to you, Charles, and to your family, we want to express our condolences on your father's passing last summer. Today, Charles and his company help feed people around the world as the world's largest family-owned manufacturer of grain bins, dryers, and other farm equipment. In fact, Sukup Manufacturing hired over 200 new workers in 2018 alone. And I think that leadership and that legacy of job creation is worth a round of applause. Thank you, Charles, and thank you to Sukup. (Applause.) We also have with us John Williams, the Chairman and CEO of Jamison Door Company in Hagerstown, Maryland. Jamison Door Company was founded more than a century ago by three men with, I'm told, a little bit of money and a lot of determination. Since then, this family-owned business has produced more than a million doors for homes and businesses all across America. They've grown to more than 120 employees and recently broke ground on a new 50,000-square-foot manufacturing plant. Last year, thanks to the tax relief we'll talk more about in a moment, John Williams and Jamison Door actually was able to offer a raise to every single one of their employees even after they had given two separate bonuses worthy of a week's salary. That's what we call sharing the wealth and growing the American way. (Applause.) Thank you so much to Jamison and to the whole team. It's great. John stood with us in the Rose Garden at the White House last April when the President highlighted the incredible boost those tax cuts have given to manufacturers across the country. And the truth is, for the past two years, business leaders, like Charles and John, and all of you in this room, have been lending your support to advance the agenda the President and I were elected to bring to Washington, D.C. because you knew it would make a difference not just in our companies but in your communities, in your state, in your nation. From tax relief to new trade deals to deregulation, I wanted to come here to say ""thank you."" Thank you for standing with us as we have fought for American jobs and American workers. Because of you, we have unleashed prosperity for the American people and revitalized our nation's great manufacturers. We truly have. And just as we're grateful to each of you , (applause) , and just as we're grateful to each and every one of you for your support, let me assure you that America's manufacturers have no greater champion than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) This is a President whose family lived the American Dream. Came up in a small business of his own , a small family business. Watched his father build an enterprise. He had a bigger dream. He wanted to go across the river and build the big builds on Manhattan Island and eventually build a national and an international name and reputation in construction and hotels and hospitality. But this is a President that understands that a nation grows if a nation builds. He understands that manufacturing is vital to our nation. You, in the room here, build our roads and bridges. You make the cars and trucks that make America run. You forge the planes that travel our skies. You discover and develop life-saving medicines. You deliver affordable energy that powers our homes and businesses. You produce the food that feeds the nation and the world. And when it's all said and done, you make our families stronger, our lives more prosperous, and American manufacturing makes America succeed. (Applause.) You also create good-paying jobs that are really the foundation of the American Dream for millions of our fellow citizens. You know, I come from the state of Indiana where, back when I was governor, I used to say, ""In the Hoosier State, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things."" And I know the strength that manufacturing is in my home state and is in states all across this country. You, actually, at this very moment , manufacturers , employ more than 12 million Americans in all 50 states. And as President Trump wrote , President Trump said when he spoke, rather, to you in our first year in office: The drive and dedication of your workers ""makes this country run,"" and their ""creations power our communities and protect our nation."" The truth is, American manufacturing and American manufacturing workers are the backbone of America. It's the truth. (Applause.) And all told, manufacturers contribute more than $2 trillion to our economy, and the overwhelming majority are small businesses. And this President understands the critical role that manufacturers play in the life of our nation. And since day one, as you've observed and partnered with us, we've been fighting to make it easier for you to make the products that make America and easier for the men and women who work on your shop floors to succeed. Since the 2016 election, I'm proud to report to you that, with your strong support for the policies that we've advanced, businesses large and small across this nation have created 5.3 million new jobs. And that includes good-paying manufacturing jobs all across America. (Applause.) You know, it's amazing to think, under the last administration, more than 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost every single month on average; 210,000 jobs lost to manufacturing over the eight years of the past administration. In fact, the truth is, the last administration all but gave up on manufacturing in America. I'll never forget, at a town hall meeting in 2016 , right after my running mate had promised that we would bring back manufacturing jobs , then President Obama memorably asked, quote, ""What magic wand do you have?"" Remember that? He couldn't believe it. He said, quote, ""What exactly are you going to do?"" Adding, quote, ""There's no answer to it."" The words of the last President of the United States. But you in this room knew we did have an answer: less government, less taxes, less regulation, and President Donald Trump. And we thank you for your leadership and support. (Applause.) The truth is, in our first year in office, we more than made up for the loss of manufacturing jobs under the last administration. And today, thanks to your hard work and this President's leadership, there have been 480,000 new manufacturing jobs created since Election Day. No magic wand; just commonsense American ideals put into practice. And manufacturing is roaring back. (Applause.) In fact, I'm told 2018 was the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years. Last year also marked the highest level of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. Just a few months ago, NAM announced that more than 92 percent of American manufacturers have a positive outlook on the future. And I can just tell looking at all of your faces that that statistic is holding even through today. But, you know, it's not just manufacturing. Under our administration, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low. We've seen the lowest unemployment rates on record for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. And just last week, after the previous administration and countless experts said it couldn't be done, our administration announced that, for the first time in 13 years, we achieved over 3 percent economic growth for an entire calendar year. The American economy is roaring again. (Applause.) Now, this is a testament to all of you who are gathered here , to job creates in businesses large and small all across the country. And it's a testament to all the hardworking Americans that you employ. The truth is, the reforms that we've brought about have meant more money to invest in your business. A growing economy also means more money for your workers and for their families. And one of the most encouraging statistics to the President and me is that after years , years where we saw wages, you know, stubbornly stuck at a modest level of growth, today are rising at the fastest pace in more than 10 years, and they're growing fastest for blue-collar workers, the backbone of the American economy. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. And working Americans are prospering as they haven't done so for more than a decade. (Applause.) And, you know, I don't have to tell you in this room , this hasn't just happened. It's a direct result of the leadership and policies that President Trump and our administration have been advancing and that you've been fighting for , literally fighting for since day one of this administration and throughout the long tenure of this great association. But just look at what we've done in the area of regulation alone. The National Association of Manufacturers actually studied this issue, and I'm told that you found that federal red tape costs manufacturing businesses an astounding $19,500 per employee, per year. And for those of you running small manufacturing firms with fewer than 50 employees, the burden of federal regulation almost doubles to nearly $35,000 per employee, per year. It's amazing. That's why President Trump promised on the campaign trail, and every day since, to roll back the heavy hand of government. And we set a goal at the start of this administration to cut two regulations for every new federal regulation that we put on the books. But we didn't quite hit that mark, because the truth is we blew right past it. In the last year alone, I'm pleased to report to you that thanks to the President's leadership, our administration has cut 12 federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. We're cutting federal red tape as never before. (Applause.) In fact, this President has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. And since our election, we've actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners. And under President Trump's leadership, we've also been busy unleashing American energy, the lifeblood of our economy, manufacturing, and the entire nation. We withdrew from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. He approved, early on, the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines. He opened up Alaska National Wildlife Region, one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world. And thanks to these collective actions and the ingenuity of our energy producers, the United States is now the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. (Applause.) And of course, with the strong support of NAM, before the end of our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes across the board for working families, family farms, and businesses large and small, and manufacturers just like those gathered here. We slashed the corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to below the average. We eliminated the death tax for nearly every American small business owner. And we gave businesses like yours the ability to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your new equipment for the next five years. For decades, jobs and investment poured overseas, but in the past two years, company after company have been making record investments right here in America. Because under this President and this administration, we will always promote and protect what the President calls those four beautiful words: Made in the USA. (Applause.) But with all we've accomplished in these first few years, as this President likes to say, that's just what we call a good start. If you haven't noticed, the American people actually elected a builder to be the 45th President of the United States. And I'm here to tell you that this President and our administration are absolutely committed to rebuilding the infrastructure of America. It is time for a major bill from the Congress to rebuild the roads and bridges and ports and highways of America. (Applause.) As the President said in that State of the Union Address, ""Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."" And so they should. We're committed to working with the Congress to make historic investments in our infrastructure so that businesses can get your goods to market quicker and more efficiently than ever. You know, I've always said that roads mean jobs. And I don't just mean road jobs. I mean, the truth is, those of you in manufacturing understand that the right infrastructure makes it possible for you to deliver your goods not only across your state, across the nation, but across the world. And we're going to make sure , we're going to make sure that you have the infrastructure to support a growing economy. And to make sure that you can hire the workers you need to keep growing your business and investing in workers, this President is also making it easier than ever for the American people to get the training they need for the manufacturing jobs of the future. Recent studies show nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs are going to be created by businesses like yours in the next decade. But some 2.4 million of those jobs could go unfilled. Seventy percent of manufacturers are already seriously concerned about finding workers. And I hear it all the time, as I travel around the country, about the need for workers and the need for job training and workforce development. The skilled trades in particular, I'm told, are increasingly hard to come by. Electricians, welders, and machinists are in high demand, and too few Americans pursue these valuable paths. You know, the President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable. And that's why, in our first year, the President signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and vocational education to help all Americans adapt to the constantly changing needs of the 21st-century America. We will make sure that we have the best-trained workforce in the world. And we'll work with each and every one of you to accomplish that. (Applause.) But it's not just here at home where we've been fighting for Americans manufacturers. This President has also been busy forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we're negotiating deals that are built on the principles of free, fair, free, and reciprocal trade. And let me take this moment to thank all the leaders of this great organization for your strong support of our administration last year when the President negotiated and signed a replacement for the outdated NAFTA deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has arrived. (Applause.) The USMCA, as it's known more briefly, is going to impact, we believe, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs that depend on exports [to] Canada and Mexico. And the USMCA will finally give workers the level playing field that we need to compete and win on a global stage. But now , now that the agreement has been signed and it's going to be considered in the Congress, let me take this opportunity to encourage your renewed energy and support. Governor Ducey and I were just speaking about this a few moments ago, about the importance of us hearing from business leaders and from state officials him, about the importance of swift congressional approval of the USMCA. The truth is, we'd done our jobs. We've negotiated a deal that puts American jobs and American workers first. And it's time for Congress to do theirs. So we urge you to send a strong message to members of Congress in all 50 states that it's time to approve the USMCA, and we must see it approved by Congress this year. (Applause.) While we've been forging new trade deals, we've also been standing up to unfair trade practices where we've encountered them around the world, and that most especially applies to the relationship and the challenges that we face in our economic trading relationship with China. For too long, China has pursued policies that are inconsistent with free and fair trade. And we all know it. As President Trump has said, for years the United States faced, in his word, ""tremendous tariffs"" in trading relations with China. In fact, in 2017 alone, Beijing's trade abuses contributed to a $375 billion trade deficit between the United States and China. But as President Trump made clear, those days are over. You know, I'll never forget one of the early meetings, in the first year of our administration, with Chinese officials that came to the Oval Office in the White House. The business leaders in the room would have loved to have been there. You know, this President has a way of negotiating the way you all do over business deals every single day. There's a friendliness about it. There's a cordialness about it. And then there's a directness about it. And I'll never forget when we sat in the Oval Office with the Chinese , one of the Chinese officials that has come over. The President told him, you know, things have to change; that three-, four hundred billion-dollar trade deficits was no longer acceptable. Business as usual had to change. But he started it out by saying, ""Look "" , he looked at them and said, ""Look, you all have done your thing."" And he said, ""That's the past. This is now the future."" He said, ""I'm not looking backwards; I'm looking forwards."" But he did look at this Chinese official , I got to tell you , and he said , he look at him, and he referred to a trade barrier, Governor, that had been erected sometime in the early part of the last decade. And the President looked at him across the Oval Office and he said , he said, ""Well, you all put that trade barrier up."" And he said, ""Yeah, we did."" And he said , and he said, ""Do you mind if I ask you, how did you get away with that?"" And the Chinese official looked at him rather shyly and said, ""Nobody ever called."" And the President just said, ""Well, there you have it."" Well, I'm here to tell you, men and women of the National Association of Manufacturing [sic], those days are over. This President is picking up the phone. He is traveling the world. He is fighting for trade deals that are free, and fair, and reciprocal. And we're going to have trade that wins for America and wins for American manufacturers. (Applause.) Now, two weeks ago, I'm pleased to report, a delegation of Chinese officials came to Washington, D.C. to continue our ongoing negotiations. And as the President reported there, that we made substantial progress, most especially on structural issues , things like intellectual property and forced technology transfers. All the kinds of things that have beset American manufacturers seeking to do business in that part of the world. The President said, and we all recognize, that, for the first time, America has put ourselves in a position of strength, having imposed tariffs of some $250 billion. And I can assure you that negotiations are going to continue. The President has actually announced that he's making plans to meet with President Xi in the near future to resolve outstanding issues. And, in fact, we're so encouraged that, because these discussions have been so productive, the President decided to delay an increase in American tariffs that had been scheduled for just a few days ago. But I want to promise each and every one of in this room: President Trump and our administration will continue to stand strong until we establish trade between the United States and China that is free and fair and reciprocal. (Applause.) Finally, as we gather here in Arizona , and I know you're here from all over the country , the people here of Arizona appreciate more than most we have a crisis on our southern border. And this President has stepped forward to provide leadership to address that crisis. And the truth is, despite what you may hear from some of those that opposed the President's border security on Capitol Hill, this is a crisis the likes of which we've never seen before. I mean, for the first time ever, the majority of illegal immigrants coming into our country are unaccompanied minors and families, people who are being exploited by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north through our southern border. And just today, the Department of Homeland Security announced that during this fiscal year to date, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of family units apprehended compared to the year ago. And we saw an incredible rise in the number of large groups who are attempting to cross the border. Two years ago , and the Governor knows these numbers well , two years ago, Border Patrol only encountered two groups of 100 or more individuals. But today, Secretary Nielsen announced that more than 70 large groups have been apprehended, a total of more than 12,000 people. Now, Democrats in Washington say this is a manufactured crisis. But the only thing manufactured is their outrage. Every day we don't secure our border, we allow the crisis to worsen, more lives to be endangered on both sides of the border, and more drugs to flow into our country, and more harm to come to American jobs and American workers. And that's why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security. We've already started to build the wall. We've secured some $23 billion for border security funding. And the President used his authority under the law to declare a national emergency on our southern border. Now, some in Congress are trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address this very real crisis. So, today, allow me to call on each and every one of you to join us in calling on members of the Senate to support the President's emergency declaration, stand up for border security, and put the safety and security and wellbeing of America first. (Applause.) Now, before I close, know this: In the days, and weeks, and months ahead, we're going to continue working to ensure that our nation's manufacturers grow and thrive, because we know that when you succeed, America succeeds. The stakes could not be higher, and the choice we face could not be clearer. As I said this weekend at another gathering, it is remarkable to think that as we gather here today, leading Democrats are openly advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of what's called Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, Democrats in Washington, D.C. and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that impoverished nations and has stifled the liberties of millions over the past century. That system is socialism. What they're actually offering is just more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more government, and less freedom. I've said before; I'll say it again: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that is moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union and extend the blessings of liberty to every American. It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever actually pass it into law. The truth is, Margaret Thatcher has it right: ""The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people's money."" The truth is, we want to make poor people richer, and they want to make rich people poorer. We want to make poverty more rare, and they want to make poverty more comfortable. I mean, that really is the choice that we face today. For all the progress that we have made over the last two years, as we look at the days ahead and I look at this gathering of extraordinary business leaders and job creators from all across the country, I hope you'll see that choice before us, as well. It is a debate between freedom and socialism; a debate between personal responsibility and government dependence. The President said it well in his State of the Union Address. In his words, ""America was founded on liberty and independence, and not [on] government coercion, domination, and control."" And so, I say, the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. So I say to all the leaders gathered here today, for the sake of our economy and our jobs, for the sake of all the hardworking people that are living the American Dream, working in great companies like yours, or aspiring to work with you and work in your enterprises freedom; for all of those that have a dream and want to live it out; and for the sake of our freedom: Let's say no to socialism. Let's say yes to freedom and prosperity and the pro-growth agenda that we know will make America strong. (Applause.) And I promise you , I promise you the President and I are going to keep fighting , keep fighting for all the things that you've supported over the last two years that have revived American manufacturing and are reviving this economy. But the truth is, it's going to take all of us in the days ahead. So I want to encourage each one of you to do your part. Keep promoting pro-growth policies, pro-jobs policies in Washington, D.C. and all around the country. And promote the policies that you know are going to not only make your company stronger but make our states and our nation stronger. By that I mean talk to your employees. Talk to your workers. Go meet with people in the cafeteria. Talk about the larger issues of the day. Talk about how we've been able to roll back taxes and regulation; how we've been able to fight for free and fair and reciprocal trade in ways that are contributing to their livelihood and the opportunities that they and their family have. Tell them how we've been rolling back the heavy hand of government so that your company can innovate, give them job security, and create more opportunities for more people in the community in the years ahead. I mean, tell them how we're putting Washington, D.C. back to work for them. And tell them that we're going to keep fighting for each and every one of them. Talk to your suppliers as well. Talk to your business associates. Send out an email. I mean, the truth of the matter is, those of us who serve in public office , whether it be the President, whether it be the Governor, whether it be Linda McMahon, or this Vice President , we can only do so much. You're the leaders in your communities and your state and all across this nation. And we want to encourage you today to let your voice be heard. On all these major issues, just know that sending an editorial to your local paper, sitting down for a local interview, talking to your employees, or speaking at a local Rotary Club makes the difference all across this country. And we encourage you to let your voice be heard. And I truly do believe that with your continued support, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with support all across this country for policies that are making American manufacturing and American economy strong, and with God's help, we will make this country more prosperous than we could ever possibly imagine. We will make this country safer than it's ever been before. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. (Applause.) And God bless the United States of America. It's an honor to be with you."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1327183/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-national-association-of-manufacturers-board-of-directors-meeting&speechType=1	National Security Foreign Affairs Trade Immigration		Scottsdale, AZ	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-national-association-manufacturers-board-directors-meeting-scottsdale-arizona/
VSMP632019106	Mike Pence	2019-03-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence at The Latino Coalition Legislative Summit	speech	"Well, thank you, Hector. Thank you for that kind introduction. And join me in thanking Chairman Barreto , (applause) , for so many years of leadership in business and public life. It is an honor to be with you today. To Alfredo Ortiz, Ambassador Barcena, to all the business leaders and entrepreneurs gathered here today, it's an honor to join The Latino Coalition, the Job Creators Network, and to say to all of you, buenas tardes , (laughter) , and congratulations on ""expanding the power of U.S. Latinos."" (Applause.) It's great to be at the Latino Coalition's 2019 Summit. And as I get started, let me bring greetings from a great champion of Hispanic Americans and a champion of expanding opportunity for all the people of this country. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it's great to be back with all of you. It was my privilege to speak at this summit for the first time as Vice President just two short years ago. As gather here today, it's really remarkable to think about all that we have accomplished with the support of all of you in this room. As the President himself said at last year's summit, this administration is ""committed to unleashing the full potential of the Latino community by removing government burdens restoring safety and security to our neighborhoods, and by defending America's interests so that all our citizens can prosper."" And that's exactly what this President and this administration have done over the last two years. (Applause.) President Trump promised to roll back the heavy hand of government, and last year, our administration actually cut 12 federal regulations for every new federal rule on the book. In fact, this President has already signed more bills cutting back federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) And like all of you in this room, in this administration, we know small businesses are the engine of the American economy. And that's why we've been working tirelessly to help make it possible for you to invest in your workers and grow your businesses. We've made it easier for you to create association health plans. And all told, since taking office, we've delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and small-business owners in America. That's what we call promises made and promise kept. (Applause.) And finally, as all of you well know, with the support of so many of you in this room and the millions that you represent, before the first year of administration was even done, this President kept his word to the America people when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) We cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and businesses large and small all across this country. We cut the corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to below the average. We eliminated death taxes for nearly every American small-business owner so death is no longer a taxable event in America. (Applause.) And we gave business owners, like so many of you gathered here at this summit, the ability to deduct 20 percent of your business income, and 100 percent of the cost of your new equipment for the next five years, making it more possible for you to grow your equipment , grow your property, plant, and equipment, and hire more Americans and create more jobs. (Applause.) That's the difference that having a businessman in the Oval Office is making for Americans. And the results of this pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda, frankly , I don't have to tell all of you in this room , it's been nothing short of remarkable. In just over two years, under the leadership of this President and with all of your support, businesses large and small have created 5.3 million new jobs all across America. (Applause.) Unemployment is at a 50-year low. And the unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans has reached the lowest level ever recorded in American history. (Applause.) The American Dream is roaring back for every American. And, in fact, wages for American workers , after years of being stuck in with little or no growth in wages , wages today are rising at the fastest pace that they've risen in nearly a decade. And most exciting of all, they're growing fastest , wages are growing fastest for blue-collar workers, the backbone of the American economy. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) It's true. I mean, everywhere you look, confidence is back, jobs are coming back. In a word, America is back. And we're just getting started, my friends. It's true. (Applause.) And, you know, what brings us all here today is you all know that that's nowhere more true than in the Latino community. As President Trump has said, Latino business leaders are ""living proof that the American Dream is back [bigger] and stronger than ever"" before. Today, more Hispanic Americans are working than ever before in American history. Latino-owned businesses employ more than 2 million Americans and contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to our economy every year. Now, all of you business leaders gathered here today are part of an integral story of success in America. People like Cici Rojas. Where are you Cici? (Applause.) Stand up, Cici. We just said ""hello."" (Applause.) She's the owner of Tico Productions in Kansas City, Missouri, and one of the reasons why Latina-owned small businesses are the fastest-growing sector in our entire country. Cici's company provides Spanish-language broadcasts for two NFL teams: her hometown Kansas City Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders. And thanks to the President's tax cuts, Cici has been able to grow her business and pick up two new NFL clients, the Jaguars and the Ravens. And in our first year in office, I actually had the privilege to meet Cici at the Naval Observatory when we were celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. And, Cici, let me just say thanks for being such a great example of American success in this growing American economy. (Applause.) Take another bow. We're also joined today by Rafael Cuellar. Where's Rafael hiding out? Rafael, stand up. Good to see you. (Applause.) Rafael is a veteran of the United States Navy, and we are grateful for your service to America in uniform. Rafael told us that he inherited his entrepreneurial spirit from his dad, who opened a small bodega in New Jersey when Rafael was just a kid. And after he retired from the Navy, Rafael took over the family business , a chain of Shop Rite grocery stores, which has grown tremendously under his leadership. And thanks to the President's tax cuts, Rafael told us he's been able to open another store and continue growing the family business. Join me in congratulating Rafael and Cici on living the American Dream and proving that success is happening in this country like never before. (Applause.) Thank you, Rafael. And thank you, Cici. You know, the President said not long ago, in his words, ""The Latino community embodies the pioneering spirit of America."" We believe that's why Hispanic Americans are starting new businesses at nearly three times the national average. And under President Trump's leadership, Hispanic business owners are confident about the years ahead. I was just told, according to a survey that just came out, in the next 12 months, 87 percent of Hispanic business owners are planning to expand their business, and more than half of them are planning to hire more Americans. (Applause.) That's a record and a promise of even more success. You know, the truth is, as you all know, the Hispanic community is one of the most dynamic in our entire country, and your success is America's success. But as the President likes to say, everything I just described , all the momentum in this economy , that's just what he calls a good start. I mean, the truth is, we're fighting for America's job creators not only here at home with new policies for less taxes, less regulation, expanding access to American energy as never before, but we've also been forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we're negotiating deals that are free, fair, and reciprocal, and put America first. (Applause.) You know, it's been my honor to travel to Latin America five times since becoming your Vice President to strengthen our partnerships in the region , like, in December, when I attended the inauguration of the new president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. And all across the Western Hemisphere, this administration is continuing to work to expand opportunity for American businesses, and we're going to continue to do just that. And let me take a moment , let me take a moment to thank all of you who stood so strongly with this President and this administration when we finally renegotiated and signed a replacement for the outdated NAFTA deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has arrived. (Applause.) And you made a difference. Your voices, your engagement with your elected representatives, your willingness to go out and give voice to the need for a new deal between the United States and Mexico and Canada, standing firm with this President while he drove a hard bargain, has put us in a position for a fresh start , a fresh start in North America. The truth is, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs depend on exports to Canada and Mexico, and the USMCA will finally give these workers the level playing field they need to compete and win on a global stage. But we've negotiated a new deal, but now we need your help again to build momentum to have the Congress get behind this agreement. And so I encourage each and every one of you to reach out to your representatives in the Congress of the United States, reach out to the congressmen and senators, and tell them that we need to ratify the USMCA and we need to do it this year. (Applause.) So we've made great progress. The American economy is booming. With less taxes, less regulation, more affordable American energy, innovation is expanding all across the Latino community and all across the American economy. And the truth of the matter is we're going to continue to build that momentum with the kind of trade deals across the world that will put our jobs and our economy first. But we all know, to sustain economic growth, we have to strengthen the foundations of our prosperity. We have to uphold freedom and the rule of law. And the time has come to fix our broken immigration system once and for all. (Applause.) You know, like many of you, I'm an American because of legal immigration. My grandfather immigrated to this country from Ireland when he was just about my daughter's age. The legend in my family is that my grandmother walked my grandfather up the hill across the street from their house in Ireland and looked out to the West and said, ""You have to go to America because there's a future there for you."" And the truth is, she was talking about me. (Laughter.) His name was Richard Michael Cawley. And that's how his grandson Michael Richard Pence got to be Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) What a country. What a country. It's amazing to think. Sometimes I tell people that, when they say, ""What were you thinking about on Inauguration Day, standing there in the cold taking that oath of office?"" And I'll be honest with you, I had my wife and my kids at my side, and I was really , I was thinking a lot about my grandfather and thinking about what he would think looking down from glory. And I'm convinced of two things. Number one, we were very close; he knew me very well. And I know he would be very surprised. (Laughter.) But the other thing I thought, in my heart of hearts, was that, as he looked down from glory, that he just thought he was right to come. And this is a country where anybody can be anybody. If you work hard and play by the rules, and keep your promises, you can live the American Dream. And that's really why we've got to take on this system. We've got to take on this broken immigration system. We need a legal immigration system so that more people can live the dream that my family has lived and is living today, and that many of your families have lived, as well, and are living as we speak. We need a system that is built on merit, on opportunity for all. But the truth is, men and women, that all begins with border security. Because as the President has said many times: If you don't have a border, you don't have a country. (Applause.) It's true. (Applause.) And the truth is, after months of Democrat denials and claims of a manufactured crisis on our southern border, today's headlines across the nation tell a different story, don't they? The New York Times headline reads: ""Border at ""Breaking Point' as More than 76,000 Migrants Cross in a Month."" In the Washington Post, the headline reads: ""Family migration, already at record levels, rocketed to new high in February."" And the Wall Street Journal's headline: ""Record Immigration Surge at the Border."" It's just like the President and I have been saying: We have a crisis at our southern border, and the time has come for America to act. (Applause.) And the truth is, it's a crisis like we've never seen before. And the Wall Street Journal said it well today, and I quote, ""More migrant families crossing into the United States illegally have been arrested in the first five months of [this] federal fiscal year than any prior full year."" The reality is, what's happening at our southern border is different than it's ever been before because, for first time, a majority of people attempting to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north to take advantage of our porous border and loopholes in our laws. And the truth is, as the President has said, it's hurting , it's hurting innocent people on both sides of the border. And the truth is, on the journey north it's reported that 70 percent of illegal immigrants report being victims of violence. Nearly one-third of women traveling to our southern border from Central America are sexually assaulted on the journey, according to Doctors Without Borders. Just yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that, in the last five months, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of families apprehended compared to the same period the year before. Every day we don't secure our border, we are allowing the crisis to worsen and more lives to be endangered and exploited. And as I saw firsthand at the Phoenix Field Division of the DEA just yesterday, despite the incredible work that our men and women in law enforcement are doing, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this crisis at our southern border to flood drugs into our country, harming our children and our families and our communities. Mexican and Central American drug cartels are the principal wholesale sources for drugs for street-level gangs and dealers across this country, and their deadly trade has brought untold suffering to millions of American families. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years old. In 2016, across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. We're talking about families. I had a senator just last week say to me , he said, ""We don't have a crisis on our southern border."" He says, ""We have a crisis in all 50 states that's being driven to what's happening on our southern border."" Opiate abuse and addiction. Now, this is all why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security. It's why the President used his authority to declare a national emergency on the southern border. But despite the fact that he has clear statutory authority under the National Emergencies Act, as I stand before you today, some in Congress are trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress actually gave him to address what is an undeniable humanitarian crisis at our border. So let me say this from my heart: A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote against border security. A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote to deny the real humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. And so we call on every member of the United States Senate: Set politics aside. Stand up for border security. Stand with this President. And put the safety and security of the American people first. (Applause.) So we've been standing up for the rule of law, for prosperity and security in our country. But as I stand before you today, I couldn't be more proud of an administration that's been upholding the rule of law and expanding prosperity all across our hemisphere. We've been standing for freedom and prosperity in this hemisphere of freedom. It is remarkable to think what's occurred in Venezuela in recent years. Venezuela was once one of the richest and most vibrant democracies in the Western Hemisphere. But under the socialist rule of the dictator, Nicolas Maduro, it has become one of the poorest and most despotic. Today, it's remarkable to think that than 9 out of 10 people in Venezuela live in poverty. More than 3 million Venezuelans have already abandoned their homes to flee the brutality and deprivation of the Maduro regime. From early in this administration, President Trump has led the effort to isolate the dictator Maduro through economic and diplomatic means. And just last week, I went to Latin America to deliver a message to our partners in the region and to the people of Venezuela: Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go. (Applause.) The United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela. (Applause.) And now, more than 50 nations on Earth have followed us. And it was my honor to meet with President Guaidó and his wife Fabiana in person just a week ago in that trip to Colombia. Remarkable and courageous people who love their country deeply and are committed to restoring democracy. We discussed our shared effort to provide humanitarian relief to the long-suffering people of Venezuela. And we made it clear to leaders around the world: There can be no bystanders in the struggle for Venezuela's freedom. And the United States calls on every nation on Earth to recognize Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's President, and take the side of freedom. (Applause.) But I promise all my fellow Americans in the room, we'll continue to stand strong. In fact, today, the State Department is announcing that the United States will revoke 77 visas, including many officials of the Maduro regime and their families. We will continue to hold the Maduro regime accountable until libertad is restored in Venezuela. (Applause.) But the truth is, as many of you know, and the Venezuelan people know, their oppressors do not act alone. Under this President, we've also stood strong and stood up with those that , stood up to those who've aided and abetted the dictatorship in Venezuela. The truth is, the only way Maduro clings to power is with the brutality of his supporters and with the help he receives from communist Cuba. As President Trump said in his speech to Venezuelan exiles in Miami not long ago, ""Maduro is not a Venezuelan patriot; he is a Cuban puppet."" The people of Venezuela know Cuba's leaders are the real imperialists in the Western Hemisphere. For decades, Cuba has tried to create client states across the region under the guise of providing assistance by sending abroad doctors that are barely more than indentured servants. While normal countries export goods, Cuba exports despotism and strong-arm tactics. Cuba's influence has driven Venezuela's failure, and the time has come to liberate Venezuela from Cuba. (Applause.) The truth is, it's just one more reason why President Trump kept his promise when he reversed the failed policies of the last administration toward Cuba, because the Cuban people have the same birthright of liberty that God gave us all. And in this White House, I promise you it will always be que viva Cuba libre. (Applause.) So, under President Donald Trump, I promise you we're going to continue to stand with the people of Venezuela and all those across this region who are standing for freedom. And we'll continue to stand strong for freedom here at home. Because the American people have a choice to make in the next 20 months, and the stakes could not be higher, and the choice could not be clearer. It's a choice between more growth, prosperity, and opportunity for every American, or a return and an acceleration to the direction and the failed economic policies of the past. It's increasingly obvious in the public debate it's a choice between freedom and socialism. Today, many leading Democrats openly advocate an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions. What they're actually offering is just more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more government, and less freedom. So let me say from my heart, to all my fellow Americans gathered in this room, to all of you living the American Dream: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. (Applause.) It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope in the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that is moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union for every American, regardless of race or creed or color. And it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and has improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. You know, the truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. (Laughter.) And the only thing green about the so-called Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost taxpayers and job creators if they ever pass it into law. (Applause.) You know, Margaret Thatcher probably said it best: ""The trouble with Socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money."" (Laughter.) The President said it very well in that State of the Union Address, though. He said, ""America was founded on liberty and independence not [on] government coercion, domination, and control."" The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. So I say to all of you , job creators, entrepreneurs, people living the American Dream and advancing it all across this country: For the sake of our jobs, for the sake of our prosperity, for the sake of the American Dream, all of us need to say, as the President has said, with one voice, ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) So thank you all. Thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today. I leave here today with renewed confidence. I truly do. I look at the bright and shining faces of all of you that are making such a difference, creating jobs and opportunity for people in the Latino community, and growth and prosperity for communities all across this country, and advancing policies that expanding the American Dream to everyone. And I'm confident that we've only just begun. But as we steer America toward that True North of freedom and opportunity for all, that we've just begun to explore the boundless potential of the American people. And I know we'll claim that future, because I have faith. I have faith in the American people , that if we go out and speak freedom to them; if we lay out a vision for the future of boundless opportunity based on timeless American principles; if we lay out a choice between more freedom or more government, the American people will choose freedom every single time. And I believe with all my heart that, in the days ahead, if all of us in this room and all looking on hold the banner of freedom high; if we put into practice those words that were inscribed on the Liberty Bell so long ago , those ancient words to ""proclaim liberty throughout all the land [and] unto all the inhabitants thereof,"" just as they have always done before, the American people will rally to this cause. We'll keep on winning. America will keep on growing. We will preserve freedom for this generation and the next. So, as you leave this place, I hope you go with confidence as well , confidence that you have a President and an administration that's fighting every single day to expand opportunities for the Latino community and every community all across this nation, and build on the ideals and the values that are at the heart of American greatness. I hope you also have confidence in the boundless potential of the American people and the opportunity to embrace the cause and the principles that have made this nation great. And confidence, as I do, that if we will but ask for the blessings of He who established this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores, that we cannot fail. For as the Bible says, ""Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."" (Applause.) So that means freedom always wins. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the Latino community across America. And God bless America.

VSMP632019105	Mike Pence	2019-03-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence After Receiving a Briefing and Tour of a DEA Facility	speech	"Well, Governor Ducey, thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your presence here today. And to Special Agent Coleman, and to all the courageous men and women who are part of the Phoenix Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration, it's an honor to be here , an honor to be here on behalf of President Trump and on behalf on a grateful nation to say thank you. And thank you for the work that you do here on the frontlines of our efforts to prevent the flow of illegal drugs across our southern border. We're standing in a vault, and all the drugs that have piled here did not make their way to our children, our families, and our communities. The lives that you saved don't make it in the newspaper. But I want to assure you that the American people know that the men and women of the DEA save lives every day. And here at the Phoenix Field Office, you're doing work that is important to the life of this state and to the life of this nation. And I came here to learn more about it. But I came here also just to say thank you. Thank you for your dedication. As President Trump has said, there's nobody that deserves respect more than the men and women of law enforcement. And all of you gathered here today represent literally tens of thousands who serve in law enforcement across this country and then some 9,000 men and women who serve in the Drug Enforcement Administration. Here at home, and in 69 other nations around the world, the DEA is out protecting the American people and interdicting the nefarious drug trade from impacting our families and our communities. As I said, every American is grateful. And we're especially grateful in the midst of a crisis on our southern border. The efforts that you are putting in here, dealing with an unprecedented challenge on our southern border, for the first time ever, the majority of people crossing our border illegally are families and unaccompanied children. In fact, the statistics just released today from the Department of Homeland Security demonstrate that Customs and Border Protection has seen more than a 300 percent increase since last year in the number of families units apprehended. A 300 percent increase. It's being driven , as men and women of the DEA know, it's being driven by the drug cartels and by human traffickers who exploit vulnerable families in Central America, entice them to make the long and dangerous journey north. They exploit them and they exploit their presence to bring even more illegal drugs into our country. It's what Special Agent Coleman described to me today. The challenge that we face between our ports of entry in the midst of this crisis on southern border is what our DEA agents face every single day. The truth is, the crisis on our southern border today is overwhelming our system, and transnational criminal organizations in Mexico and Central America recognize it as an opportunity to peddle more of their poison into our country. Here in this sector, you are on the frontlines. You play a critical role in stopping their efforts. Last year alone , I commend you for the fact that you seized 27,000 pounds of methamphetamine in the Phoenix Field Division, 4,700 pounds of cocaine, 2,700 pounds of heroin, and enough fentanyl to kill one-third of the entire population of the United States , was seized by the Phoenix Field Division. You save lives every day in the work that you do here for the America people. And just yesterday, Special Agent Coleman , I'm informed that the field division announced the results of your most recent bust, working with state and local law enforcement here in Arizona , you seized $28,000 in cash; more than dozen weapons, including stolen firearms, high-capacity magazines; and arrested six suspects, including an admitted MS-13 gang member. And I think that deserves a round of applause. (Applause.) It's incredible work, and the people of Arizona and America are grateful , grateful to you and to your entire team. But the truth is, for all the progress that you make, for the difference that you make here every day, in the midst of the crisis that we face on our southern border, the reality is that your job is harder than ever before. And that's why I want to assure you that President Trump and our entire administration are continue , are going to continue to stand strong until we provide you with the resources and the support to secure our border and protect our families from the flow of illegal drugs. The nation saw the President's commitment when we recently secured $23 billion from the Congress for border security, in addition to funding for a physical barrier and a wall. But given the crisis at our border, the President, using his authority under the law, declared a national emergency and is in the process of identifying additional federal resources that can be reprogrammed and reassigned to border security and for the construction of a wall on the southern border. Speaking with Special Agent Coleman today, he pointed out to me that while there is a great deal of discussion about the number of drugs that are interdicted at our points of entry , and I'm paraphrasing your statement , but he said, ""Anybody that tells you that drugs are not coming over our border between our ports of entry doesn't know what he's talking about.' The reality is that, because of the good work of the DEA, because we're driving much of the drug trade to our points of entry, the efforts that are being made there still , because of our porous border, because of the crisis on our southern border of large groups of families and unaccompanied children , that drugs are still coming across our border between those points of entry, in large numbers, to harm our families. And let me be clear: We're going to continue to fight to make sure that we secure our border, that we build that wall, that we give our Customs and Border Protection, and all of you here at the DEA, the resources and support you need to do your job and to protect our nation. The truth is, after the President declared a national emergency, some in Congress are trying to stop the President from exercising his legal authority to confront what is a real crisis at the southern border. We're grateful for the support that we received in the House of the Representatives, but the majority still passed a bill disapproving of the President's declaration. And now it goes to the United States Senate. Any vote against the President's national emergency declaration is a vote against border security. And we call on every member of the Senate, and your senators from here in Arizona, to stand for border security, stand with President Trump, and uphold the President's call for a national emergency and additional resources to secure our border. In the days ahead, I promise each and every one of you that you'll continue to see this President standing firm, and our entire administration, to make the resources and the tools you need to do your job available, and to provide the resources to secure our border. But let me end where I began, and that is simply to say ""thank you."" It is humbling to be among heroes. And the men and women of this Phoenix field office are heroes. You save lives every day. And the truth of the matter is, you do so by confronting some of the most evil people in our hemisphere, people who literally profit from drug abuse addiction and human suffering; who apply their trade with violence. And so as I express the gratitude of the American people for what each and every one of your do, and let me also assure you of the prayers of the people of this country for your service. And we will prayer, as the Good Book says, that ""no harm would overtake you, no disaster would come near,"" that He would guard you in all your ways as you guard and protect this great nation. So with your continued courage; with this President's strong leadership for border security and our partners in law enforcement at the local level and the state level; and with the support of the American people; and with God's help, I know we will end this crisis at our southern border, we will secure our border for this generation and the next, and we will confront the flow of illegal drugs and save more lives in that, so help us God. Thank you very much. (Applause.) And God bless you for the work that you do (inaudible). (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1327178/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-after-receiving-a-briefing-and-tour-of-a-dea-facility&speechType=1	National Security Drugs Immigration		Phoenix, AZ	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-receiving-briefing-tour-dea-facility-phoenix-az/
VSMP832019104	Mike Pence	2019-03-08	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2019 Oil and Gas Association Annual Meeting	speech	"Well, thank you all for that warm welcome. And thank you, John. Thank you for that kind introduction, and congratulations to you and Governor DeWine on delivering a great victory for the people of Ohio last year. (Applause.) We couldn't be more proud. Your Lieutenant Governor , I have followed his career for many years. We got to know each other on the campaign trail. And throughout his career in public service. And John and his family have demonstrated a character, a commitment to the values that make Ohio great. Would you all join me in thanking Lieutenant Governor John Husted for a lifetime of service? (Applause.) Thank you, John. Really, it's great to be with you all. To Speaker Householder, to Senator Obhof, Steve Downey, and to all you pioneers and visionaries of Ohio's oil and gas industry: It is an honor to be here, in the great state of Ohio, at the annual meeting of an organization that is proving every day that you are fostering and promoting and advancing American energy. And American energy is prospering again. Ohio Oil and Gas Association, give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) You're making a difference for American energy. And while you're still clapping, why don't you join me one more time. John was nice enough to mention her, but she's a Marine Corps mom, she's a champion for military families. She's traveling all across this country, all across the world, representing our country with such dignity. My wonderful wife of 33 years, our Second Lady, Karen Pence, is with us today. (Applause.) Thank you all for that. It really is great to be here. You know, before I got on the plane this morning, I checked in with a friend of mine who loves the state of Ohio and who loves American energy. So as I begin, let me bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President is on his way to Alabama to be with families that were affected in Lee County, Alabama, by those devastating tornadoes that struck earlier this week. But he wanted me to convey his regards, and his great admiration and appreciation, to all you in this extraordinary record of innovation and production that all of you who are members of this great industry and in this great region are delivering for the country. You know, on the wall of the House of Representatives, where I served for 12 years, there's just a few quotes. Right above the flag, it says, ""In God we Trust."" On the ceiling, it says, ""E pluribus unum."" But then just above the flag, near the ceiling, are the words of Daniel Webster. And they read: ""Let us develop the resources of our land, [and] call forth its power, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether also, in our day [we] may not perform something worthy to be remembered."" ""Let us develop the resources of this land and call forth its power "" Throughout the early days of this nation's history, leaders in America understood that the source of American greatness was our faith and our freedom and our vast natural resources. And I'm here to tell that America, once again, has a leader who understands that our natural resources are at the heart of American greatness. And that leader is President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's true. Since early in our administration, the President promised the American people that we were, in his words, going to start a new ""energy revolution,"" one that celebrates American production on American soil. And President Trump delivered. We approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines; withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord; eliminated the hydraulic fracking rule; rolled back methane; we're ending the Clean Power Plan; scrapped the Stream Protection Rule; and now, under President Donald Trump, the war on coal is over. American energy is booming. (Applause.) In fact, it's remarkable to think that the United States of America is now the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And you make that happen every day. (Applause.) And as all the business leaders in here know, it hasn't just been just about energy. This President has been busy getting this economy moving again since the day we walked off that platform on Inauguration Day, back in 2017. The President promised to roll back the heavy hand of government. In fact, as I stand before you today, President Trump has actually signed more bills repealing federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) Since Election Day, all told, we've actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings to business owners and people that are creating jobs all across this country. And with the strong support of so many of you in this room, before the end of our first year in office, President Trump delivered again when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) We cut taxes for working families, small businesses, and family farms. We slashed the corporate tax rate from the highest in the developed world to below the average. And under this President, with the strong support of Republican majorities in the Congress, we eliminated the death tax for nearly every American small-business owner. Death is no longer a taxable event in the United States. (Applause.) And to spur growth, we gave businesses, like those gathered here, the ability to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your new equipment for the next five years. And the results have just been remarkable. His commitment to renewed American energy, to renewed American growth, to less government, less regulation, less taxes, has been truly amazing. In just over two years, businesses large and small have created 5.3 million new jobs across America. The stock market is soaring, and the unemployment rate is at a nearly 50-year low. (Applause.) In fact, the unemployment rate for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans has reached the lowest level ever recorded. And as the job report confirmed again today, wages are rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade, and more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of our country. (Applause.) And everywhere you look, confidence is back. I sense it in this room. Jobs are coming back. In a word, America is back, and we're just getting started, Ohio. (Applause.) And the energy revolution President Trump promised is going strong. Today, I'm here to report on that revolution, but mostly to say thank you. Thank you to all of you who are the foot soldiers in that revolution , the great oil and gas producers of the great state of Ohio. You're doing the work that's bringing American energy back. And there are too many stories to tell all of them here today, but I'll mention a few of them. People like David Hill, from Cambridge, Ohio. Where are you, David? Stand up. (Applause.) David is an independent producer and President of David R. Hill, Incorporated. He's a Boy Scout Council Citizen of the Year. He serves on the Cambridge Regional Airport Board. He's the past Chairman of Byesville Community Development Corporation. And David is an active member of his community, and he's a leader in this industry. In fact, David told us that he used his savings from that recent tax cut to reinvest in his business. And David is hiring more people here in Ohio again. David, congratulations. It's great to have you here. (Applause.) And then there is Jack Miller, from Wooster, Ohio. Where's Jack at? Jack Miller, stand up. Thank you, Jack. (Applause.) Jack is Chairman of the Board at Ken Miller Supply, a chain of oilfield supply stores you all are very familiar with. Over 50 years they've been providing tubular goods and also production equipment , port equipment for producers, pipeline contractors, utility companies; everything you need in this industry. Since the start of our administration, sales across their state operations, David tells us, have increased and grown by 18 percent. David's company is growing again because of the policies that we've been advancing in this administration. (Applause.) Now, David and Jack are just emblematic of all of you in this room. You're living the American Dream. You're renewing American energy. You're creating jobs and opportunities. So give them another round of applause. (Applause.) Thanks. Thanks for being who you are and being a great example to everybody here. You know, the truth is, I don't need to tell any of you how innovation can suddenly breathe life into long-forgotten towns. It's amazing to think how much the Appalachian Basin has changed in just over 10 years. It's something the Lieutenant Governor and Steven and I were talking about backstage before I came up. In 2008, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia produced 2 percent of our nation's natural gas. Today, they produce 27 percent of the natural gas produced in the United States of America. (Applause.) That's an incredible record of success. By 2025, there's one study that says that you'll produce 20 times what you did just five years ago. I'll tell you, that's American ingenuity on display, isn't it? In just over a decade, thanks to that ingenuity, the Appalachian Basin has gone from being the 32nd to the 3rd largest natural producing regions in the world. Only one country in the world produced more natural gas than the Appalachian Basin. In fact, this region produced more natural gas than entire continents, like Africa and South Africa [America], and even OPEC countries. Give yourselves a round of applause for leading the world in natural gas production. (Applause.) Ohio itself is home to more than 65,000 wells that pump out 26 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas every year. Those wells, most importantly, support some 200,000 jobs , good-paying jobs with an average salary of over $88,000 a year. Energy is growing this economy. It's making America stronger, and it's strengthening the foundation under families here in Ohio and all across this nation. (Applause.) You know, it's a testament to the risk-taking and entrepreneurship represented in this room that a majority of those wells, I'm told , like nearly 91 percent of the wells across the country , are drilled by independent operators. And thanks to you, despite all the talk of peak oil and energy shortages of just a few short years ago, the Utica and Marcellus shales are producing such an abundance. It's incredible to watch. Thanks to your daring and your grit, rather than learning to live with less, next year the United States of America will become a net energy exporter for the first time in nearly 70 years. (Applause.) Incredible. You all made this happen. And as the President has said, in his words, your ""full potential can only be realized when government promotes energy development."" And that's exactly what we've been doing. If you want proof, just look at the , look at the two states to your east. When the fracking revolution was just beginning, the state of Pennsylvania decided to embrace it, and , while the state of New York decided to reject it. The Empire State put a moratorium on fracking in 2008 and then banned it outright in 2014. You all know the story. And the people of New York have suffered as a result. From 2006 to 2017, natural gas production fell by 80 percent. And in those counties that stood to benefit most from energy development , the most in income, the most in wages, the most in jobs and prosperity, benefitting their entire community in every respect , the truth is, property values fell by more than 20 percent because of the decisions that were made. In Pennsylvania, by contrast, natural gas production expanded over 30 times. And in those counties that were allowed to develop their energy potential, jobs went up, wages went up, and now the oil and gas industry is booming like never before. Energy is a source of prosperity for American communities and American families. And you need look no further than those two examples and yours to prove it. (Applause.) It's true. And the oil and gas industry, I want to promise you, has no greater friend than President Donald Trump. And as the President said, in his words, our administration will not only seek American energy independence but will seek American energy dominance. He promised to ""eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production, like never before."" And that's exactly what we've done. Because we've streamlined liquefied natural gas terminal permitting in the first year of our administration, the United States became a net natural gas exporter. And just last month, I had the honor, on the President's behalf, to visit Poland. Karen and I traveled over there to attend a national conference, but we're directly benefitting , Poland is directly benefiting, rather , and we are , from the energy revolution. Since last October, Poland has actually signed three separate agreements with American energy companies, which, in four years' time, will allow it to import more than 7 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year. (Applause.) So our ally in Poland is benefitting by your innovation, and American jobs are benefiting by your exports. Your work is not only strengthening economic opportunities here at home, but it's strengthening the ties that bind us freedom-loving nations around the world. So American energy is soaring, and the American economy is booming. But to ensure continued growth, we all know that we've gotten to strengthen the foundations of our prosperity. And nothing is more important to this President or to the American people than the safety and security of our families and our communities. You know, the President said it many times: If you don't have a border, you don't have a country. And the truth is, as I stand before you today, my fellow Americans, it's important for you to know, despite what you may hear from many voices in the national media, that we have crisis on our southern border. It's a crisis that sees the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs, dangerous criminals, human trafficking across the border. And most importantly, you deserve to know, it's a crisis like we've never seen before. For the first time ever, a majority of people attempting to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north to take advantage of our porous border and loopholes in our immigration laws. As the President has said, ""These are heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every day on both sides of the border."" Seventy percent of illegal immigrants report being victims of violence on that long journey north. According to Doctors Without Borders, nearly one-third of women traveling to our southern border from Central America are sexually assaulted on the journey. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that, in the last five months, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number apprehended at our border compared to the same period a year before. Every day we don't secure our border, we're allowing the crisis to worsen and lives to be endangered and exploited. Just a few days ago, I saw firsthand at the Phoenix Field Division of the DEA that, despite the incredible work our men and women of law enforcement are doing every day, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this humanitarian crisis to flood more drugs into our country, harming our children and our families and our communities. The Lieutenant Governor knows well: Mexican and Central American drug cartels are the principal wholesale sources for street-level gangs and dealers across this country, here in Ohio and all across America. They've brought untold suffering to millions of families. It's amazing to think drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under the age of 55. Let me say that again: Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under the age of 55. In 2016, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. And the numbers don't really tell the tale. But I can see from the look on your faces, and the quiet nods as I speak, that you know it's about families. There isn't a community in Ohio, there isn't a community in America, that hasn't been impacted by the flood of drugs into our streets, the enormous majority of which come across our southern border. I had a senator from the northwest say just last week say to me , he said, ""Mike, the President is right. We don't "" But he said, ""We don't just have a crisis on our southern border. We have a crisis in all 50 states because of what's happening on our southern border, and it's time for America to act."" (Applause.) It's true. The scourge of opioid abuse and addiction is tearing families apart and tearing communities apart. I saw it in Indiana when I was governor; I see it across the country. It's happening here in Ohio. And the people of the Buckeye State have seen it firsthand. And I want to take the opportunity to thank Senator Rob Portman for his extraordinary leadership in the national effort to combat opioid abuse and addiction. Senator Rob Portman has made a difference. (Applause.) Because the truth of the matter is, you can see the statistics of the enormous flow of drugs that come across our southern border. We'll continue to support law enforcement at the local level. We'll continue to support treatment and remedies. But, men and women, it's also why this President has taken such a strong stand for border security. It's why President Trump declared a national emergency on our southern border, to gain the resources that we need to construct a wall on our southern border and provide all of our personnel with resources and the support they need. But despite the fact the President had clear statutory authority under the National Emergencies Act, as I stand before you today, some in Congress, next week, are going to make an effort to try and stop the President from exercising the authority that the Congress actually gave the President to confront this undeniable humanitarian crisis. So let me be clear: A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote against border security. A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote to deny the real humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. So we call on every member of the United States Senate. We call on Senator Sherrod Brown and every member of the United States Senate: Stand up for border security. Stand with this President. Put the safety and security of the American people first. (Applause.) It's an urgent crisis and one that we all need to be attending to. As I close, let me just say thank you again and also leave you with a charge and a challenge. Thank you for all you've done to renew the prosperity not just of the energy industry in America, but the prosperity of this country as a whole. The strength of this country is derived, I will always believe, from our faith, our freedom, and our vast natural resources. And as this industry prospers and grows strong, America grows strong. But know this: In the days and weeks ahead, we're going to continue to work to ensure that our nation's energy producers grow and thrive, because we know that when you succeed, America succeeds. But the stakes in the days ahead could not be higher. And as you watch the headlines and the debates taking place on cable television, it's probably becoming obvious to you too that the choice we face could not be clearer. As I said a few short days ago, it is remarkable to think that as we gather today, many liberals in Washington, D.C. are openly advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of what's called Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, liberals in Washington, D.C. and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and have stifled the liberties of millions. And that system is socialism. What they're actually offering is just more of the same: it's more taxes, more spending, and more government, and less freedom. But I say from my heart what Americans have known for generations: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. (Applause.) It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that's moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union and extend the blessings of liberty to every American. And it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. So we must say, as the President has said, America will never be a socialist country. (Applause.) The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever pass it into law. (Laughter.) You know, the truth is, Margaret Thatcher said it best, ""The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people's money."" (Laughter and applause.) So in the days ahead, I want to challenge each and every one of you in this room to do two things. Number one, keep growing and keep prospering. Keep taking risks. And know that, from the Oval Office on down, in this administration, we're going to keep fighting every day to give you the freedom and the flexibility to continue to develop the resources of this land in a responsible way, to benefit our nation, to strengthen the foundations of our country, and to prosper the communities across Ohio and across this region. Just keep doing what you're doing. We don't often talk enough about , simply growing a business and raising a family is a civic contribution. So grow your business. Work with one another. Compete with one another. And stay on this fast track to American , not just American energy independence, but as the President said, ""American energy dominance"" in the days ahead. Because I know Ohio is going to lead the way. Ohio is going to lead the way. And the second thing I'd leave you with is simply this: And that is, as we look at that choice that we face in the next 20 months , and I see the response that each of you have to all of the , what we've laid before you today , the progress that we've made not just in energy, but in advancing freedom, lowering taxes, rolling back regulations, negotiating free and fair and reciprocal trade deals that are benefitting American jobs and American workers, is just go out and tell somebody. Recognize that you're leaders in your communities, not just in your industry. Give voice to the progress that we have made. I mean, the truth of the matter is that the choice the American people are going to face in the next 20 months , as I said before, I'll say again , could not be clearer. And Ohio has always played an outsized role in decisions this nation has made. Ohio chose this President, this administration, and a new direction for America in 2016. And we need all of you to stand with us and make sure Ohio chooses four more years of freedom and prosperity and President Donald Trump. (Applause.) But I leave here today with just a thankful heart. Karen and I are on our way to Kentucky and then on to Georgia before the day is gone. As the poet wrote, ""We have miles to go before we sleep."" But I have to tell you, it's great to be with all of you today and, really, to celebrate what you all are accomplishing not just for your families and your businesses, but I want you to know what you're accomplishing, you're accomplishing for America. And I leave here today with renewed confidence that each and every one of you are doing , doing more than just growing a business. It's , you're doing what those words Daniel Webster spoke on the floor of the Congress more than a century ago. You're developing the resources of the land, yes, but you're calling forth its power. You're supporting its great institutions. And I just want to assure you all, you're doing something worthy of your time, worthy to be remembered. And as you continue to do all that you do to strengthen the foundations of this country, grow this economy, and support the ideals and the principles, I promise you we'll stand with you. We'll keep fighting with you. And with your continued support, with this great leadership at the state level in the great state of Ohio, with renewed conservative majorities at every level of government, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help, the best days for Ohio and America are yet to come. Thank you very much. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

VSMP1232019103	Mike Pence	2019-03-12	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Credit Union National Association's Government Affairs Conference	speech	"Well, hello, CUNA! (Applause.) And I want to say thank you to Jim Nussle. Thank you for your kind introduction. He's been my friend of many years. In our time together in the United States Congress, he served with great distinction as our Budget Chairman. He served an administration as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. And now leading this vital organization in the life of this nation, Jim Nussle has made a difference expanding opportunities for American families. Would you join me in thanking my friend, Jim Nussle, for his great leadership? (Applause.) And it's an honor to be here with all of you men and women who work hard every day to help Americans achieve the American Dream for their families, for their businesses. You build local communities. Credit unions are a part of everything good that is happening in cities large and small across this country. And it's my great honor to be here at the 2019 Government Affairs Conference of the Credit Union National Association. Thank you so much for welcoming me here today. (Applause.) And I want to give a special welcome to some great friends of mine from my time in the Congress, my time as a governor of the great state of Indiana. We've got some Hoosiers in the house. (Applause.) John McKenzie, Dave Abernathy, all of you who are here with the Indiana Credit Union League: I am just delighted to see you all again. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a great friend of credit unions and a great friend of all of you, and a man whose leadership has revived the economy of the United States of America. I bring greetings from President Donald Trump to each and every one of you. (Applause.) And I'm here today, on the President's behalf and on behalf of our entire administration, really just to say, ""thank you."" Thanks to all of you for the vital role that you play in our nation, for the work you do to help millions of Americans build stronger families and build stronger businesses and stronger communities. The truth is, people that know members of this great association know you make it possible for American families to buy that next car, to send a child to college, buy that dream home. You make it possible for countless entrepreneurs to start a small business and to help drive our economy. The men and women who run America's credit unions , each one of you and all those you represent , you really do incredible work every day. There's really too many stories to tell today, but let me mention a few. Sara DeLance is here from Rutland, Vermont. Sara, are you in the house? (Applause.) Fifteen years ago, I'm told, Sara took her first job as a part-time teller at her local credit union. But today, because of her hard work, skill, and determination, Sara is a Senior Vice President at Heritage Family Credit Union. And just last year, she was recognized for her outstanding service when Sara was named one of Vermont Business Magazine's Rising Stars. Now let's hear it for Sara. (Applause.) I'm also told that with us today is Maurice Smith, CEO of the Local Government Federal Credit Union in Raleigh, North Carolina. In more than two decades of experience with credit unions, Maurice has earned many awards for his success. But the impact of his work reaches far beyond the balance sheet. I'm actually told that Maurice makes a special effort to help credit union members whose incomes are more modest, like all of you do every single week across the country. He treats every one of his clients, I'm told, as if they were his only client. In fact, a longtime member of Maurice's credit union recently said that, even years after she first joined, she, in her words, still feels like she's the credit union's ""most important member."" That's the difference the personal impact , the personal touch that America's credit unions make every single day in communities across America. And I know each one of you are emblematic of that outstanding service. So join me in thanking Sara, Maurice, and every single one of you and your employees for your care and your diligence on behalf of the communities you serve. (Applause.) It really is remarkable to think about the difference that credit unions make nationwide. You serve 115 million Americans, with more than a stunning $1 trillion worth of loans. Over the past two years, you've also stood by the side of this President and this administration as we've fought to advance a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda. And just as we're grateful to have you as our allies, you can be assured: The American credit unions have no greater champion than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's true. You know, over the past two years, President Trump has signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) Since Election Day, we've actually delivered more than $33 billion in regulatory savings for working families and business owners. And, as all of you know, that also included their fundamental reform of the Dodd-Frank law. (Applause.) As all of you know, Dodd-Frank restricted your members' choices that limited the freedom of the American people to make financial decisions that were the best for them. Dodd-Frank made Washington bureaucrats more powerful and less accountable, giving them ever-more control over the work that you do every single day. It was, in every sense, a failed law that resulted in tens of thousands of pages of burdensome regulation , a mountain of red tape that created a tremendous burden on America's credit unions and ultimately on the families and businesses that you serve. Since Dodd-Frank was passed into law nine years ago, the number of credit unions in America actually declined by more than 25 percent. It was an average loss of one credit union each day. That's why President Trump took action. And with the support of majorities in the Congress, this President signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act into law, rolling back some of Dodd-Frank's most damaging regulations. (Applause.) And you all were a part of that. And your support in that effort made a tremendous difference, and you have our thanks on behalf of the American people that you serve. Now, credit unions understand the needs of your members far better than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. ever will. And you showed that in the fight for that reform. And under President Trump's leadership, I want to promise you: Under this administration, we are going to continue to empower you to do what you do best: serving your members and serving growing communities across America. (Applause.) But the truth is, we haven't just been rolling back red tape on institutions like yours and on businesses large and small. Under this President's leadership, we've unleashed American energy as well , the lifeblood of our economy that fuels small businesses and family farms that credit unions support so much. And thanks to our actions today, and thanks to the leadership of this President and the ingenuity of American energy entrepreneurs, today the United States is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. And next year, we will be a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) Under this President's leadership, we're also forging new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we're negotiating deals that are free, fair, and reciprocal so working families and business owners can serve and can compete on the world stage. And, of course, with the support of all of you in this room and people all across the country, this President kept his promise to the American people before our first year was out when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) With the strong support of credit unions and your members around the country, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, family farms, and businesses of every size that credit unions serve. And we made it possible for families and businesses to keep more of what they earn. And the results of this agenda, as I'm sure you've witnessed on Main Street America, has been nothing short of extraordinary. Since Election Day, businesses large and small across America, in cities and towns, have seen businesses create 5.3 million new jobs, including 490,000 manufacturing jobs. The American economy is roaring again. (Applause.) Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. And today, unemployment has hit a nearly 50-year low. We've actually seen the lowest unemployment rates ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The truth is, the American Dream is working for every American once again, and credit unions are a part of making that happen. (Applause.) It's amazing to think more Americans are working today than ever before in our nation's history. A growing economy means more money for the families that you serve. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade. And it's truly meaningful to the President and me that the most rapid growth of wages in America today is among blue-collar workers, the backbone of America. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) So we've made great progress. The American economy is booming, and you all are a part of that extraordinary story of progress. But as we gather here today in our nation's capital, I want to assure you: In this administration, we understand that security is the foundation of our prosperity. That's why our administration has taken decisive action from our very first days to promote the safety and security of the American people. Yesterday, President Trump submitted his budget request to the Congress. It called for fiscal discipline in discretionary domestic programs and a record investment in national defense and border security. As the President has said many times, ""If you don't have a border, you don't have a country."" So as I stand before you today, all of you gathered here from all 50 states across this country, you deserve to know , whatever you hear in the national media , the truth is, we have a crisis on our southern border. It's a crisis of illegal immigration, drugs, dangerous criminals, and human trafficking. And you also deserve to know that it's a crisis like we've never seen before. For the first time ever, a majority of people attempting to come into our country through our southern border illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey from Central America by drug cartels and human traffickers who take advantage of our porous border and loopholes in our laws to encourage people to pay cash to be taken up to our border. As the President has said, in his words, ""These are heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings on both sides of the border."" The truth is, 70 percent of illegal immigrants report being victims of violence on their journey to our southern border. And according to Doctors Without Borders, nearly one-third of women traveling to our southern border report being sexually assaulted on the journey. Now, just last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced that, in the last five months alone, Customs and Border Protection has seen a more than 300 percent increase in the number of families apprehended compared to the same period one year ago. My fellow Americans, every day we don't secure our border, we are allowing the crisis to worsen and more lives to be endangered and exploited. And despite the incredible work that our men and women in law enforcement are doing, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this crisis at our southern border to flood drugs into our country, harming our children and our families and the communities where you live and lead. It's heartbreaking to acknowledge that, today, drug overdose is the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. In 2016, all across America, some 174 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. These statistics don't tell the story better than I know you already know it, because I know the role that credit unions play in your communities. You're involved in every worthy cause, in every charity. You are an integral part of your communities. And so when the stories are told of heartbreak, you've already heard those stories. A member of the United States Senate from the American northwest told me not long ago , he said, ""Mike, I'm standing strong with the President for border security."" He said, ""Because we don't have a crisis on our southern border."" He said, ""We have a crisis in all 50 states of opiate abuse and addiction, and it's time for America to act."" (Applause.) The crisis on our southern border is affecting us all. It's affecting every community in America. That's why President Trump has taken such a strong stand for border security, declared a national emergency on our southern border. Despite the fact that he has clear statutory authority under the National Emergencies Act, some in Congress are actually trying to stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress gave him to address what is an undeniable humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Now, we're grateful for senators who are working to find a way to address this crisis and support the President's emergency declaration for border security. And after I leave you today, I'll travel to Capitol Hill to continue those discussions. But let me say this: A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote against border security. A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote to deny the real humanitarian and security crisis that is happening at our southern border. And so we're calling on every member of the United States Senate: Set politics aside. Stand up for border security. Stand with this President. And put the safety and security of the American people first. (Applause.) And I know many of you are headed to Capitol Hill in the days ahead. When I was a member of Congress, I always looked forward to my credit union leaders coming in. I know you'll be talking about economic issues in your community. But you serve families. It's one of the things that makes credit unions so special. And so I encourage each one of you, as you meet with representatives in the House and Senate, just encourage them to take a stand for border security. Encourage them to stand with this President as he's taking such decisive action to secure our border. And once we've secured our border, I promise you we will work with Congress to fix our broken immigration system once and for all. (Applause.) We'll do it. So as I close, let me just say ""thank you"" once again to all of you for all you've done to bring opportunities and prosperity to American families. I know what you do. You know, I'm a small-town guy from southern Indiana. I know the difference that credit unions make in communities large and small across this country. In my hometown, you know, there was never a Little League Baseball game, there was a never a high school function, there was never a local charity, or a church event where you didn't see the local credit union banner hanging back on the fence. You all are always there and you make a difference. And you're to be commended for that. And in the days ahead, I just want to assure you that we're going to keep working to make sure this nation continues to grow and thrive; that you continue to sit down with those members and help them achieve their dreams for themselves and for their family, and their children and their children's children. And at this time in the life of our nation, I have to tell you, the work that each one of us are doing couldn't be more important. And, frankly, the choice we face couldn't be clearer. You know, it is remarkable to think , as we gather in the midst of this extraordinary prosperity, in the most prosperous nation on Earth, built on free enterprise, built on that American Dream , many of the leading voices in the other party are actually advocating an economic system that has impoverished millions around the world. Under the guise of what's called Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, liberals in Washington and in the national debate are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and have stifled the liberties of millions. That system is socialism. The truth is, what they're actually offering is more , just more of the same: more government, more taxes, more spending, and less freedom. The truth is, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever pass it into law. (Applause.) You know, Margaret Thatcher had it right. She said, quote, ""The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people's money."" (Applause.) You know, President Trump said it well in his State of the Union Address. He said, ""America was founded on liberty and independence, and not [on] government coercion, domination, and control."" (Applause.) And so in the days ahead, I urge each and every one of you who make the American Dream happen, go out there and also tell members why it's happening. It's because of freedom, free enterprise that gives us the opportunity to live our dreams. I believe with all my heart the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America. So we must say, with one voice, as President Trump said before the Congress, ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) So to all the leaders gathered here today: Thank you again. Thank you for what each and every one of you do to come alongside families in your communities, to be there and to strengthen everything that makes America strong and prosperous. You stand alongside hardworking people that are living the American Dream. You build great communities. And I just encourage you in the days ahead, whether it be standing for border security or standing up for those timeless American ideals, let you voice be heard. And I'll promise you, the President and I are going to keep on fighting for all the principles and policies that you've supported not just over the last two years, but as so many of you have supported throughout your lifetimes and the lifetime of this movement. The truth is, it's going to take all of us in the days ahead to keep America growing, to keep America on the pathway of the principles that are restoring American greatness each and every day. And so I want to encourage each and every one of you, as I go, to let your voice be heard not just on Capitol Hill this week, but when you go back home. Recognize that you're leaders in your community. You know, I'll always believe that all the cable TV shows in the world, all of the social media, all the mail pieces and TV ads in political campaigns don't matter a hill of beans than when somebody that you know and respect in a community speaks up about issues that are important to your family, or to the community, or the state or the nation. So we encourage you, just let your voice be heard in the days ahead. And lastly, just continue to stand with those families. I've seen it firsthand. It has always been touching to me that credit unions don't have clients; you have members. They're communities, and they're born of the great tradition of associations that's always been the heart of America. People coming together to find solutions with one another, to build on the principles of free enterprise and opportunity and individual responsibility. And so just keep doing what you're doing. Keep believing in the communities that you're serving. Keep believing in those people that come in nervously with their hands wringing, and they sit across the table from you and they tell you about their dream. And keep investing in the American Dream. In a word: Have faith. Have faith that, when given the opportunity and the freedom, the American people demonstrate each and every day that this is a nation where dreams come true. Credit union members make that happen. But also, I encourage you to continue to demonstrate the faith that I've seen characterized in so many credit union leaders over the years, and faith that each and every one of us are precious in the sight of God. Each and every one of us, when given the opportunity, can achieve our dreams. Because those words written so long ago are still just as true today for each and every person you meet. They're over the mantle in our house at the Vice President's Residence, and they continue to guide our little family. For I know the plans I have for you , plans to prosper you, not to harm you; plans to give you a hope and a future. With faith in Him who promises a hope and a future to all our people, I say ""thank you."" Thank you for your service. Keep up the great work. And God Bless you all. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1328862/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-credit-union-national-associations-government-affairs-conference&speechType=1	Finance and Banking		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-credit-union-national-associations-government-affairs-conference/
VSMP1332019102	Mike Pence	2019-03-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence at U.S. Customs and Border Protection Advanced Training Facility	speech	"Well, thank you all. Thank you for the warm welcome. And would you join me in thanking Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for her tremendous leadership of the Department of Homeland Security? (Applause.) Couldn't be more proud and couldn't be more grateful. Please be seated. As I begin, let me , let me also say thank you to another great supporter of this administration and a great supporter of Homeland Security and the men and women of Customs and Border Protection. Congressman Alex Mooney, thank you so much for your leadership. It's great to be in your great congressional district. (Applause.) Thanks, Alex. Great guy and a great champion of all of you. To Commissioner McAleenan, Assistant Commissioner Hall, and to all of you who serve to protect the safety and security of the American people on our borders and throughout this nation: It is my great honor to be able to be here to address all of you who represent the more than 240,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Thank you for what you do every day to keep the American people safe. (Applause.) And it's an honor to be here at this Advanced Training Center of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. We had an extraordinary tour and to see the way that you are training the trainers here. You know, the Good Book tells us that ""iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."" And thank you to those of you who are the trainers, those of you who are here being trained to be better equipped as leaders. Thank you for being here and for all you do to make the men and women who protect our borders and enforce our immigration laws and see to the security of this nation in departments across this country even more effective and more successful. Join me in thanking all the trainers here at this Advanced Training Center. (Applause.) We're proud of you and grateful to you. And to all of them and to all of you, allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of the men and women of law enforcement across this country and especially the extraordinary men and women of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I spoke to the President when I arrived here at the advanced training facility today. We had a few moments to touch base. And when I told him I was in West Virginia and that I was with the men and women of Customs and Border Protection, I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) But he wanted me to make sure you knew how grateful he is, how grateful we all are, for the service that all of you provide to the people of this country. You make a difference each and every day. And I'm really here on the President's behalf and on behalf of not only our administration, but on behalf of all of the American people to make another installment on a debt of gratitude that our nation owes to all of you and to your families. Would you join me in giving a round of applause to the families that support the work of the men and women who wear the blue, who wear the green, who wear the tan? (Applause.) You know, the men and women of CBP and DHS do extraordinary work every day to protect our country. I've heard today, in briefings with your senior leadership, that they couldn't do it without the world-class instruction that you have here at the Advanced Training Center. It truly is remarkable to have witnessed. For 14 years, this training center, I'm told, has given specialized training to senior Border Patrol and federal law enforcement personnel. Some of you who are with us today are receiving that training, and I have no doubt you'll use it , use the lessons that you learned here to make the men and women that you lead even more effective, make our nation more secure, and make it more possible for them to do their jobs and come home safe. It's remarkable to think that, every year, more than 17,000 Border Patrol and law enforcement agents come to this facility to train, attend classes, receive hands-on instruction. You use state-of-the-art technology, virtual reality, live combat exercises to replicate conditions and threats that Border Patrol and law enforcement face every day in the field. It's important to remember that, as you confront the challenges on our border , including the humanitarian crisis that we're facing on our southern border , each and every day, the men and women of Customs and Border Protection are also dealing with dangerous criminals, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and violent gang members like MS-13. And the training that you receive here is all evidence of the commitment the American people have to making sure that you have the resources and the support and the training to be able to accomplish your mission in that challenging and dangerous environment. I just saw today, at the facility, you teach Border Patrol and law enforcement agents how to use every available tool, from K-9s to physical barriers, to prevent the illegal entry of criminal aliens and drugs at our ports of entry and on our border. And the American people deserve to know that your hard work and training is making a real difference on our border and all across this country. It's amazing to reflect that, just a month ago, that the Nogales Port of Entry in Arizona Customs and Border Protection prevented more than 250 pounds of fentanyl from entering the United States of America. (Applause.) Tremendous. That was enough fentanyl to kill nearly one-third of the entire population of our country, and it was the largest fentanyl bust in CBP history. And the team at Nogales has our congratulations and our thanks. Last month, working with state and local partners, CBP agents stopped a shipment of illegal drugs from passing through the Port of Newark, ultimately seizing more than 3,200 pounds of cocaine worth $77 million. That's worth a round of applause too. (Applause.) These drug busts save lives all across the country. You know, the President and I always reflect on the fact that the lives you save every day don't make it in the headlines. But I want you to know the American people know it. It's not just the interdiction that's reported in newspapers and on television, but it's the recognition that what you stop at our ports, what you stop at our border doesn't make it into our communities and doesn't tear apart families across this country. These drug busts and what's happening all across this country every day are a testament to the exceptional training here at the Advanced Training Center. So to all of you , the men and women of DHS and CBP , all of you are helping all of our agents on the frontlines do their job and come home safe. You all deserve one more round of applause. We are truly proud and truly grateful. (Applause.) Despite all the success and the work that you enable here at this Advanced Training Center, the American people deserve to know that your work is more important and, frankly, more challenging than ever. Because, as all of you know, our nation today faces an undeniable security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border. It's a crisis of illegal immigration, drugs, dangerous criminals coming into our country, and human trafficking. And it's unlike any crisis we've seen at our southern border before. For the first time ever, a majority of those attempting to come into our country illegally are families and unaccompanied minors that are being enticed by drug cartels and human traffickers to make the long and dangerous journey north to our southern border to exploit our porous border and loopholes in American law. As President Trump has said, in his words, ""These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every day on both sides of [our] border."" And that's why this President has taken decisive steps to act to end this crisis on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) And the facts are really appalling on both sides of the border. As all of you at CBP know, 70 percent of illegal immigrants apprehended at our border report being victims of violence on the journey north. Nearly one-third of women from Central America, according to Doctors Without Borders, have been sexually assaulted on the journey north. It's extraordinary to think of these criminal syndicates and drug cartels that are taking advantage of vulnerable populations in Central America, not just to gain the cash that they require people to pay to take the long and dangerous journey, but to literally use groups of vulnerable people to draw attention of border protection away from the movement of drugs in another part. Last week, this very department reported that, in the last five months, Customs and Border Protection has seen a 300 percent increase in the number of families apprehended compared to the same time last year. More than 2,000 illegal immigrants are being apprehended each day at our southern border. Border Patrol has apprehended more than 268,000 people since the beginning of the fiscal year. That's 100 percent increase from last year. And every day we don't secure our border, we're allowing this crisis to worsen and lives to be endangered and exploited. And despite the extraordinary work of all of you and those you represent in law enforcement, drug cartels and smugglers are exploiting this crisis to flood drugs into our country, tearing apart our families, claiming American lives. It's remarkable to think drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for adults under 55 years of age. As the President will discuss with law enforcement leaders at the White House later today, in 2017, across this country, 192 people lost their lives to drug overdose every single day. As one senator said to me, standing up at a meeting on Capitol Hill just a few short days ago , a senator from the American northwest , he said, ""I'm standing with this President for border security because,"" he said , he said, ""Mike, to be honest with you, we don't just have a crisis at our southern border. Because of what is happening at our southern border, we have a crisis in all 50 states."" And that's why the President is right to act. (Applause.) It's a humanitarian crisis. It's a crisis of drug abuse and addiction and human trafficking across this country. I stand before you today, and I'm very humbled by the courage represented in this room. Because the truth is, in the midst of this crisis, it's our law enforcement personnel who bear the burden of the crisis that we face, as well as American families. I'm informed today that assaults on CBP agents rose by nearly 50 percent in the last year. And CBP agents put their own lives at risk to rescue some 4,300 people from serious injury or death as they were making the dangerous trek north to our border. The commitment to law and order and compassion of Customs and Border Protection is a source of great pride for the American people. We're proud of your work. (Applause.) So as I said, this crisis is affecting every community in America. And President Trump and our entire administration are determined , are determined to confront it to make sure that you have the resources and the support that you need to accomplish the mission that each of you has stepped forward to achieve for the American people. You know, this nation saw in high relief earlier this year when President Trump took a strong stand for border security for 35 days, worked with members of Congress to demand that we had the resources and the support that Homeland Security told us that you needed to build a wall, to secure our border, to provide additional personnel and technology to accomplish your mission. The President and I are grateful for the men and women of CBP, DHS, and all who enforce our laws. Especially, I want to say thank you to all of you who stood tall and stayed on mission through those 35 days. You've never wavered. And the American people and this President and I are grateful. (Applause.) At the end of that impasse in Washington, we did secure more than $1.3 billion to build 55 miles of physical barrier along our southern border. But as the President made clear from the very beginning, after getting the counsel from the Department of Homeland Security, CBP, the Commissioner, and all of the experts, we made it clear that wasn't nearly enough. That's why, earlier this week, President Trump submitted a budget request to the Congress. It called for fiscal discipline in discretionary programs, a record investment in national defense, and it called for $32.5 billion for border security, including additional $8.6 billion to finish building that wall in the next year. (Applause.) I'm pleased to report the President is also calling for nearly half a billion dollars to hire additional CBP and ICE law enforcement officials , more than 1,700 personnel on the frontlines to give reinforcements to all of you who are in the fight for law and order at our borders in this country. Help is on the way. (Applause.) But to ensure that all of you have the resources you need to do your jobs as we confront this crisis, President Trump declared a national emergency at our southern border. Now, we're grateful to members of Congress from the great state of [West] Virginia who've stood with this President in his emergency declaration. We're grateful to Congressman Mooney; we're grateful to Senator Shelley Moore Capito and others in the West Virginia delegation. But despite the fact that the President has the clear statutory authority under the National Emergency Act, as I stand before you today, some in Congress are actually poised to try and stop the President from exercising the authority that Congress actually gave him to address this crisis. Now, we're grateful for senators who are continuing to work to find a way to address this crisis and support the President's emergency declaration. I was on Capitol Hill yesterday for productive discussions with many of the senators who are looking to address this crisis and support border security. But I told them, and I'll tell all of you: A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote against border security. A vote against the President's emergency declaration is a vote to deny the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. So today, before all of you brave Americans, we call on every member of the United States Senate: Stand up for border security. Stand with President Trump and put the safety and security of America first. (Applause.) And I'll make you a promise to all of you who enforce our laws: Once we've secured our border, we're going to work with members of Congress in both parties to fix our broken immigration system once and for all. You know, this administration will always stand with the men and women who enforce our laws all across this country. And the men and women of Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security are cherished members of our law enforcement community. I actually learned today the Department of Homeland Security has the largest law enforcement contingent in the United States of America. Being here, looking out at all of you, let me say to you and all the men and women of law enforcement across this country: In this White House, under this President, we will always have your back. (Applause.) And just as every day you fight to keep our nation safe, I'll promise you: This President and our entire administration are going to keep fighting for you. We're going to keep fighting for all of you to have the resources that you need and the respect that you deserve. Now, I remember, in recent years, it became fashionable for some in the national media to reflexively criticize men and women of law enforcement when moments of tragedy happened. We all remember those days. And we hear the , we hear harsh comments about the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection still too often, and of the extraordinary men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But let me assure each and every one of you: The support you receive from this President and his Vice President is just emblematic of how the American people feel. I was out there on the range today, and I went in and watched a wrestling match , (laughter) , in the training center. And I told , I told those extraordinary trainees and trainers , I said , I said, ""Look, we're with you, but you need to know the American people are with you."" I hear it everywhere I go. The President hears it everywhere he goes. So just be confident of that. Just be confident the American people appreciate the fact that, when you put that uniform on every day, you're counting their lives as more important than your own; that you're answering a calling to serve this country. Something larger than yourself defines your life. I mean, you have no ordinary job. You don't put on your business attire and go into work every day and your family is absolutely confident you'll be home for dinner. They know it's different. My uncle was a police officer in Chicago for 25 years. And to this day, the men and women who put on a uniform, put on a sidearm every day, are my heroes. And I just want to assure you that's how the American people feel. Whatever might be happening in Washington, D.C., whatever the debates might be happening on cable television, just know the American people are with you, because they know the sacrifices that you make. Last month, I was visiting CBP personnel at the Port of Baltimore, and we reflected on the sacrifices that you make and the risks that you take. We remembered a fallen member of the federal law enforcement family, Border Patrol Agent Donna Doss. Donna lost her life doing her duty in a traffic stop along the southern border. But her sacrifice is simply emblematic of the sacrifices others have made, whose names will forever be enshrined in the hearts of the American people under this great department. But it's also proof of the danger and the risk that you take every day. So as you continue in your work, just know that this President, his Vice President, our entire administration, and the American people are grateful. We recognize the threats that you face on our behalf every single day. We're grateful for the work that you do to protect our families and our communities. And we're going to keep fighting to make sure you have the resources and the support and the wall and the technology you need to accomplish your mission. (Applause.) It's no ordinary job. I think law enforcement is a calling. And I can see on your faces and the quiet nods that there are people in this room that see it just that way. Every day, you serve with courage, you serve with distinction, you make America proud. But I also want to assure you: You have our gratitude. You have our support. You have our determination to make sure that you have the resources that you need to accomplish your mission. But also, I'm very confident when I tell you, you also have the prayers of millions of Americans. You know, the sweetest words the President and I ever hear as we travel across this country is when people will reach out and grab a hand and say, ""I'm praying for you."" This is a praying nation, and the American people pray for the men and women of our law enforcement community every day. And so will I. My prayer will simply be that , in those ancient words, that in the days ahead, as you train here and as you prepare to return to the frontlines of enforcing our laws and securing our border, that ""no harm [would] overtake you no disaster [would] come near you and that He will guard you in all your ways"" as you guard and secure this great nation. And I know, with your continued courage and service, with our President's leadership and the support of the American people, and with God's help: We will secure our border, we will end the crisis at our southern border, and we will make America safer and stronger than ever before. So thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

VSMP1432019101	Mike Pence	2019-03-14	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Breakfast with Prime Minister Varadkar of Ireland	speech	"Well, top of the morning. (Laughter.) And welcome to the official residence of the Vice President of the United States. This is an extraordinary tradition, and it is a great, great honor, for our third time, as a family in this historic residence to welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland, Leo Varadkar back to Washington, D.C. (Applause.) There's a distinguished group of guests here, and, Mr. Taoiseach, I thank you for continuing what's become a tenured tradition of beginning your visit to our nation's capital as St. Patrick's Day approaches this coming Sunday here at the Vice President's Residence. And we are so honored to be able to extend the hospitality of this home to you. But we're also really honored to be joined by your partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett. He does great work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. And, Matt, it's an honor to have you here with us as well. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. If you're enjoying the hospitality this morning, the credit goes to the Second Lady of the United States, who unfortunately couldn't be with us today because she's representing our country at the International Special Olympics in Abu Dhabi. But she asked my Irish sister, Annie Poynter, to represent her here today. So, Annie, thank you so much for coming today and for representing our family. (Applause.) But to the Taoiseach, I would say you've got a great group of Americans here, and we want to welcome them all. To Ambassador and Mrs. Mulhall, thank you for your presence. To Congressman Fitzpatrick, Congressman Byrne, great members of the Congress of the United States , where you will be a little bit later today for the annual luncheon , join me in thanking these distinguished members of Congress who are with us today. (Applause.) These are great Irish Americans, and there is one more member of Congress who takes great pride in his Irish American heritage. He's here with his wife, Denise. Congressman Greg Pence is with us as well. (Applause.) But to Carl Anderson, to Tom Donohue, and to my friend of many years, Father Jenkins , who is President of the University of Notre Dame , thank you all for being here this morning. (Applause.) This is a beautiful morning, and it put my mind to my very first trip to Ireland. Right after my grandfather , who emigrated from Ireland in 1923 , right after he passed away, we had actually planned to go to Ireland together. And it was June, and we traveled all around to all the communities where my great-grandparents had grown up, where my grandfather had grown up in Tubercurry and in Doonbeg. But I have to be honest with you: It was a little rainy that June , (laughter) , and I know that's rare in Ireland. (Laughter.) A little rainy. A little cold. And , but I'll never forget, one Sunday morning we were in Galway, the sun came out, the temperature rose to 70 degrees, and I went to a pub later that day and I'll never forget, a fellow behind the bar looked at me and he said, ""It's a glorious day."" He said, ""Summer came on a Sunday this year."" (Laughter.) And I thank , I want to thank the Taoiseach for bringing this glorious weather with us today to begin this great St. Patrick's Day weekend on this beautiful morning. And I know President Trump is very much looking forward to welcoming you back to the White House today for what we know will be substantive conversations. I spoke to the President this morning and he wanted me to extend his warmest greetings to you. The President said on your last visit, Ireland is a great country and the relationship is outstanding. And with your leadership, his leadership, the relationship has only grown more strong. And today is actually a perfect time to dwell on that relationship and everything that the Irish have done for America. Thirty-two million Americans trace their heritage back to the Emerald Island. Me included. The Irish people's contributions to the American story stretch all the way back to the Revolutionary War and long before. The contribution of Irish Americans to the life of this nation extends to our armed forces, to science, to sports, to business. And it's incalculable to think of the incredible contribution that Irish Americans have made and continue to make to this great nation. The Irish have given so much to America. And today, the partnership between our two countries, as the Taoiseach knows, has never been stronger. When it comes to prosperity, more than 700 U.S. companies employ 150,000 people in Ireland. And our two countries trade nearly $130 billion in goods and services every year. And I want to assure the Taoiseach that this administration is committed to growing these economic ties and making them stronger than ever before. The United States also stands with the Irish Republic as the United Kingdom continues to work through the issues of Brexit. And we look forward to the day that we can even begin talks about expanded trade and a new trade agreement to grow our two economies and prosper both of our peoples. So it's an honor to be with you today. Thank you for coming here and honoring us with your presence. But thank you also for the invitation to make an official visit to Ireland. You did say the one condition was that I had to bring my mother. (Laughter.) And I'm happy to report to Taoiseach Varadkar that I have spoken to Mom , (laughter) , first-generation Irish American mother of mine, and she has now confirmed that she will travel with us , (laughter) , to Ireland and we are making plans to return to my grandfather's homestead as we speak. So we're looking very much forward. (Applause.) You know, I'll close by way of introduction by saying it really is a joy to share this moment with you for the second year in a row. And people often ask me what I thought about on Inauguration Day when I raised my right hand. And to be honest with you, I was surrounded by my family, and I felt a great sense of humility about the opportunity that we'd been given to serve in this capacity in our nation. But as I looked out at that vast throng of Americans and took that oath, I thought about my grandfather. I thought about April 11, 1923, when a young man came through Ellis Island, traveled to Chicago, where Matt lives, and built a future. And he was proud to be an American, and he was proud of his American family, but I can still hear that Irish brogue in my heart , the way my grandfather used to speak when he talked about the old country, when he talked about his life across the pond. And to Taoiseach Varadkar, I would tell you that I've inherited a lot from my grandfather and I hope all of his best qualities. But I want to assure you, his love for the Irish people, his love for his Irish heritage is bone-marrow deep for me and for my family. And so it is such a great honor to be able to begin this celebration in our nation's capital with you here at the Vice President's Residence. With that being said, would you all join me in welcoming the Taoiseach of the Irish Republic, Leo Varadkar, to the home of the Vice President of the United States. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1328855/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-a-breakfast-with-prime-minister-varadkar-of-ireland&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs Arts, Entertainment, and History		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-breakfast-prime-minister-varadkar-ireland/
VSMP243201919	Mike Pence	2019-03-24	Statement from Vice President Mike Pence	statement	Today is a great day for America, President Trump and our entire administration. After two years of investigation, and reckless accusations by many Democrats and members of the media, the Special Counsel has confirmed what President Trump said along; there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. The Attorney General also confirmed that there was no obstruction of justice. This total vindication of the President of the United States and our campaign should be welcomed by every American who cherishes the truth and the integrity of our elections. In the days ahead, the American people can be confident that the President and our entire administration will continue to focus where we always have, on the issues most important to our country. We can only hope that Democrats, who have spent so much time on these discredited allegations, will join us to advance an agenda that will make our nation even more prosperous and more secure for every American.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1330322/statement-from-vice-president-mike-pence&speechType=6	Government Operations Criminal Justice Elections			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-vice-president-mike-pence-3/
VSMP2532019100	Mike Pence	2019-03-25	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2019 AIPAC Policy Conference	speech	"Well, hello, AIPAC! (Applause.) Thank you for that warm welcome. What an amazing turnout. And how about a round of applause for the great AIPAC team that put this extraordinary 2019 Policy Conference together? (Applause.) AIPAC President Mort Fridman, and my good friend, Howard Kohr. (Applause.) To members of Congress, Israeli ministers, members of the Knesset, to the 18,000 friends of Israel who have come from near and far: It is great to be back at AIPAC, the largest gathering of pro-Israel Americans in the United States. (Applause.) And speaking of pro-Israel Americans, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine , (laughter) , and someone history has already proven to be the greatest friend of the Jewish people and the State of Israel ever to sit in the Oval Office of the White House. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We gather here today as Americans to speak about the progress that we've made and the strength of our alliance with our most cherished ally. But I just have to say yesterday was a great day for our country, our President, and every American who cherishes the truth. (Applause.) After two years of investigation and reckless accusations by many Democrats and members of the media, the Special Counsel confirmed what President Trump said along: There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. And the Attorney General confirmed there was no obstruction of justice. (Applause.) Make no mistake about it, my fellow Americans: This was total vindication of the President of the United States and our campaign, and it should be welcomed by every American. And even if some Democrats want to spend more time on discredited allegations, the American people can be confident the President and I are going to continue to focus where we always have , on the issues that are most important to our country: on a stronger and more prosperous America and on a safer world. And that's exactly what we've done since the first day of this administration. (Applause.) I mean, think about it: President Trump promised to rebuild our military, and he signed into law the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) With that renewed American strength, he promised to take the fight to radical Islamic terrorism, on our terms, on their soil. And as the Department of Defense confirmed Friday, thanks to the courage of our armed forces and our partners in the region, the last inch of ground controlled by the Islamic State in Syria has been captured. (Applause.) Five years after ISIS controlled nearly 35,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq, and nearly 5 million people lived under their brutal regime, the ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) President Trump also promised to revive the American economy, to cut taxes, to roll back regulation, and unleash American energy. And he did it. (Applause.) Since Election Day, we've created 5.3 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low. And more Americans are working today than ever before in the history of the United States. (Applause.) No matter how you measure it , record jobs growth, record investment, record employment , the American economy is once again the envy of the world. President Donald Trump is a man of his word, and with respect to our most cherished ally, he's more been more than a man of his word. (Applause.) Under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.) You know, it's the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President alongside a President who cares so deeply about the state of Israel. Thanks to the President's leadership, our alliance has never been stronger. Our friendship has never been deeper. We stand with Israel today for the same reasons the American people have always stood with Israel. We stand with Israel because her cause is our cause, her values are our values, and her fight is our fight. (Applause.) We stand with Israel because we believe in right over wrong, in good over evil, in liberty over tyranny. We stand with Israel today, tomorrow, and we always will. (Applause.) But it's not just been talk. President Trump promised that Israel will have the resources and tools to defend itself, by itself. And, today, in the wake of the rocket attack near Tel Aviv, I'm proud to report that American support for the security of the state of Israel has never been stronger. (Applause.) And the military of the state of Israel is stronger than ever before. (Applause.) President Trump also promised to shut down the PLO office in Washington if the Palestinian Authority refused to take immediate steps to stop funding terrorists who murder innocent Israeli civilians with American tax dollars. And when the PLO refused, President Trump shut their office down. (Applause.) And today, thanks to so many of you, the Taylor Force Act is the law of the land. (Applause.) And when President Trump promised to cut off funding to anti-Israel agencies at the United Nations, he meant it. (Applause.) And last year, the United States ended all U.S. contributions to UNRWA. (Applause.) Beyond all that, the President promised to stand up to the world's leading state sponsor of terror, and he withdrew the United States of America from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. (Applause.) There'll be no more pallets of cash to the mullahs in Iran! (Applause.) And last year, President Trump did what no American President before him had the courage to do when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. (Applause.) And as though all this wasn't enough, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said just last week, ""He did it again."" (Applause.) You know, for 20 years after Israel's rebirth, Syria held the Golan Heights. And with its massive artillery, it held Israel hostage. This crucial region changed hands only after Israel won a war that was forced upon her. Years later, when Israel's enemies attacked her on the holiest day of the Jewish year, thousands of patriots stepped up to defend their homeland, including a young tank commander who singlehandedly kept a fleet of enemy tanks at bay, the great Zvika Greengold. (Applause.) It's an amazing story. Late one night, all alone on the Tapline Route, as enemy tanks rolled into Israel, a miracle happened. Captain Greengold moved his lone tank back and forth in the darkness, firing in different directions to confound and delay a far larger enemy force. His actions not only helped turn the tide of the battle in Israel's favor; they secured the Golan Heights from enemy control and, with it, saved the state of Israel from the brink of disaster. (Applause.) But for generations, leaders have recognized the Golan Heights are critical to the strategic security of the state of Israel. But President Trump took action. And today, for the first time in 52 years, with Prime Minister Netanyahu at his side, the President of the United States will formally recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. (Applause.) Our President made these decisions in the best interest of the United States. But he also believed they were in the best interest of peace, because a lasting peace can only be built on a foundation of truth. So we will work for peace, and we will pray for the peace of Jerusalem that those who love her will be secure. And peace cannot be imposed. To be lasting and to be real, peace must be negotiated. But peace can only be negotiated with partners who are committed to peace. And today's rocket attack by Hamas proves that Hamas is not a partner for peace. Hamas is a terrorist organization that seeks the destruction of Israel. And the United States will never negotiate with terrorist Hamas. (Applause.) And while any peace will undoubtedly require compromise, you can be confident of this: The United States of America will never compromise the safety and security of the state of Israel. (Applause.) In February, it was my great honor, along with my wife, Karen, to travel to Poland on the President's behalf. We represented the United States at an unprecedented gathering of leaders from more than 60 nations , leaders who sat down and openly discussed their joint commitment to peace and security in the Middle East. It was a remarkable gathering. And it was amazing to see leaders from across the region agree that the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East is the Islamic Republic of Iran. (Applause.) You know, the President's critics predicted disaster when he withdrew from the Iran deal, but the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action didn't prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It merely delayed the day when that vile regime would gain access to the world's deadliest weapons. Since then, the United States has implemented a maximum-pressure campaign to change Iran's malign behavior and hold the regime accountable for its destructive actions. And the campaign is working. The Iranian people are protesting against the regime. The Iranian economy is reeling under unprecedented U.S. sanctions. And now Iran must choose between caring for its people and continuing to fund its proxies who destabilize the region and threaten Israel. The Iranian regime openly advocates another Holocaust and seeks the means to achieve it. But I can assure you, under President Donald Trump's leadership, America will continue to stand strong. We will continue to oppose Iran's malign influence. And under this President, America will never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. (Applause.) Now, when authoritarian regimes breathe out vile, anti-Semitic hatred and threats of violence, history teaches that we must take them at their word. Last month, Karen and I stood and prayed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp in Poland. It was a deeply moving experience. As we walked about those deserted grounds, as I looked at the gas chambers, the piles of suitcases, the piles of little shoes, it reinforced my resolve that our answer to this unspeakable tragedy for this and every generation must be: ""Never again."" Never again. Never again! (Applause.) Now, my friends, we've reached a fateful moment in our history. All over the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise , on college campuses, in the marketplace, even in the halls of Congress. You know, there was a time when support for Israel was not a partisan issue here in Washington. I'll never forget the day in 2007 that I, a conservative Christian Republican, was asked to co-found the Congressional Anti-Semitism Task Force by the only Holocaust survivor ever to serve in Congress , the Democrat Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the late and great Tom Lantos. (Applause.) Support for Israel, as was reflected in that moment when Chairman Lantos came by my office, has been a long and bipartisan tradition in the Congress, spanning generations. But how things have changed. It's astonishing to think that the party of Harry Truman, which did so much to help create the State of Israel, has been co-opted by people who promote rank, anti-Semitic rhetoric, and work to undermine the broad American consensus of support for Israel. Recently, a freshman Democrat in Congress trafficked in repeated anti-Semitic tropes; alleged congressional support for Israel reflected an ""allegiance to a foreign country."" Said that Israel had, and I quote, ""hypnotized the world."" And she accused Americans who support Israel of being bought off by campaign contributions. Anti-Semitism has no place in the Congress of the United States of America. (Applause.) And, at a minimum, anyone who slanders those who support this historic alliance between the United States and Israel should never have a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives. (Applause.) The party that has been the home of so many American Jews for so long today struggled to muster the votes to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism in a resolution. You know, as governor of Indiana, I was proud to sign the toughest anti-BDS legislation of any state in the Union. (Applause.) But remarkably, today, all but one Democrat running for President voted against the Combatting BDS Act in the United States Senate. And as I stand before you, eight Democratic candidates for President are actually boycotting this very conference. So let me be clear on this point: Anyone who aspires to the highest office in the land should not be afraid to stand with the strongest supporters of Israel in America. (Applause.) It is wrong to boycott Israel, and it is wrong boycott AIPAC. (Applause.) President Trump and I couldn't be more proud to stand with all of you today, tomorrow, and always, to strengthen the ties that bind America and Israel. We here, in the United States, admire Israel and her success. In fact, we marvel at it. The Jewish people have turned the desert into a garden, scarcity into plenty, sickness into health. They've turned hope into a future of security and prosperity. A tiny land , a land with no natural resources, no rushing rivers or verdant valleys. A nation that, despite not knowing a single day of true peace, has in two short generations become one of the world's most vibrant and successful nations. Israel is an inspiration to the world. (Applause.) And the United States of America is proud to stand with Israel and her people as allies and cherished friends. Providence entrusted the United States to be the guardian of liberty, and that's a trust we will never forsake. That they shall sit, every man and woman ""under his vine and under his fig tree, and that none shall make them afraid,"" shall be our anthem. (Applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, Israel and the United States will always stand together because America and Israel are more than friends. We're more than partners or allies. My friends, the United States and Israel are family. (Applause.) We're mishpucha. (Applause.) We are a family, descended from a common tradition of faith. We're a family that upholds common values. And together, we share a common destiny. The American-Israeli alliance is stronger than ever. Our friendship is greater than ever. And together, our future can only be brighter. And as President Trump has pledged: Our administration will always stand with our cherished friend and partner, the State of Israel. And so thank you. Thank you for the honor of addressing you today and for your support. It is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President at such a time as this. And I thank you. (Applause.) But permit me to close with a blessing to all my fellow Americans who love this country, and to all those gathered here who cherish Israel and the people of Israel: May the Lord bless you and keep you.May His countenance shine upon you and be gracious unto you. And may all your ways be paths of peace. With the unwavering support of all of you and all of those who call these two great nations home, with the leadership of President Donald Trump, and with God's help, I know the best days for Israel and the United States of America are yet to come. (Applause.) Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. And God bless the United States of America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1332215/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-2019-aipac-policy-conference&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-2019-aipac-policy-conference/
VSMP263201999	Mike Pence	2019-03-26	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Fifth Meeting of the National Space Council	speech	"Well, thank you all. To Governor Ivey, Secretary Ross, Secretary Chao, Secretary Wilson; to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine; to all the members of the National Space Council and the Users' Advisory Group; to Dr. Deborah Barnhart and the great team here at the Space and Rocket Center; honored guests; and especially to all the dedicated the men and women of the Marshall Space Flight Center: It is great to be back in Rocket City. (Applause.) Thank you for joining us for this fifth meeting of the National Space Council at an enormously important time in American leadership in space. And while you're at it, join me in thanking our host today, the men and women of the United States Space and Rocket Center, who keep the great tradition , past, present, and future , of American space leadership alive every day. (Applause.) And speaking of space enthusiasts, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a man who is committed to securing American leadership here on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, the United States has always been a nation of restless pioneers, ever striving to explore uncharted territories, reach new horizons, and venture into the unknown to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. And as President Trump has said, in his words, ""It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our [own] adventure into the great unknown."" And over the past two years, we've begun writing the next great chapter of that adventure with American ingenuity and American industry. And, you know, it's especially fitting to gather here, in Rocket City, as we prepare to celebrate later this year the golden anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, which carried the first men to the Moon and was powered by rockets developed right here in Huntsville, Alabama. (Applause.) And as we approach that anniversary, I can tell you it's a special honor and a privilege for us to be joined in this effort by one of those two courageous astronauts whose lunar module set down on the Sea of Tranquility. Ladies and gentlemen, would you mind getting on your feet and helping me to welcome and thank Apollo 11 astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, for a lifetime of service and heroism. (Applause.) Fifty years ago, ""one small step for man"" became ""one giant leap for mankind."" But now it's come the time for us to make the next ""giant leap"" and return American astronauts to the Moon, establish a permanent base there, and develop the technologies to take American astronauts to Mars and beyond. (Applause.) That's the next ""giant leap."" (Applause.) And as we'll hear today from these members of the National Space Council and our distinguished panelists, under the leadership of President Trump and with the strong support of NASA's 13th Administrator, we've made great progress toward renewing America's proud legacy of leadership in space. We have been updating out-of-date regulations to unleash America's pioneering space companies and forge the technologies to blaze new trails into space and create American jobs for the future. We've been implementing the first-ever policy of space traffic management to enable commercial enterprise and protect our nation's asset in a [congested] orbital environment. And to meet the growing security threats in the war-fighting domain of space, at the direction of our Commander-in-Chief, this year, working with the Congress, we will establish the sixth branch of our armed forces: The United States Space Force. (Applause.) In fact, I'm proud to share with all of you that the President has announced his nominee to lead the new unified combatant command, the United States Space Command, today. Four-star Air Force General John Raymond will lead U.S. Space Command. (Applause.) And while we're mentioning people that we admire, I know she'll soon be returning to the academic world, but let me take this moment to thank Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson for her tireless work and the historic role she has played in helping the Air Force launch the United State Space Force. Thank you, Heather, for your service to the nation. (Applause.) Today we stand at the dawn of a new era of space exploration , an era that will bring untold new challenges and opportunities, and it will demand the best of us. It will demand new ideas, renewed energies, courage, and bold action. After spending more than 45 years in low-Earth orbit, President Trump and our entire administration believe that it is time to push onward to new horizons and new destinations. And that's why, under the President's leadership, we've taken decisive action to propel human space exploration missions further into the depths of our solar system, and we've unleashed America's private pioneers to cultivate the vast expanses of low-Earth orbit. Last year, NASA and American innovators began designing the precursor to outposts on the Moon and the mission to Mars, the Lunar Gateway. And we are rallying the world to join us in this vital work. This month, Canada became our first international partner and announced a 24-year commitment to cooperate on the Lunar Gateway. (Applause.) And, as we speak, we're working with Congress to provide $500 million to get an American crew aboard this lunar-orbiting platform in the coming years. We've also made great progress on the Commercial Crew Program. This month, the Crew Dragon's successful mission was the first time since the last space shuttle flight in 2011 that we launched an American rocket from American soil, designed to send humans to space orbit. And as President Trump said not long ago, before the year is out, ""American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets."" (Applause.) You know, I had the chance to talk to one of the Americans who was aboard the International Space Station when the Crew Dragon docked there. She's an American patriot, a combat veteran, a United States Army aviator who recently traded her Army uniform for an American spacesuit, Anne McClain. And today, we're honored to be joined by two other pioneers of space flight who helped blaze the trail for Anne and for every young American who dreams of one day leading her nation in space. So join me in thanking these American heroes for their service and leadership: Colleen , Colonel Eileen Collins and Dr. Sandy Magnus. These are two great American heroes. (Applause.) So, we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold new vision for space , a vision to push our nation farther and faster than ever. And unlike the last few administrations, we've had the budgets to match it. In fact, with the strong support of leaders in Congress, like the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Alabama's own Senator Richard Shelby , (applause) , the President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget since the days of the Apollo program. And we've fully funded the Space Launch System and the Orion space capsule. (Applause.) And, of course, in December of 2017, the President signed Space Policy Directive-1 to return Americans to the moon and prioritize crewed missions to the lunar surface. SPD-1, as it's come to be known, marked a watershed moment for America's space enterprise. Since the disastrous decision to cancel the Constellation Program in 2010, the truth is NASA's exploration efforts were left adrift with no clear direction, focus, or mission. To your great credit, the men and women of the Marshall Space Flight Center never gave up. You persevered with distinction through a time of indecision at the highest levels of our national government. And you continued to do your best, which is to build the greatest and most powerful rockets ever known to man. Give yourselves a round of applause for persevering here at Marshall , (applause) , and developing the rockets of the future. With Space Policy Directive-1, President Trump finally gave NASA the clear direction and clear mission that it needs. And as President Trump said, we will return ""American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use."" And as he said, not only to, quote, ""plant our flag and leave our footprint[s],"" but to ""establish a foundation [on the Moon] for an eventual mission to Mars."" (Applause.) Now, over the past two years, I've had the privilege to travel across this country and meet with many of NASA's more than 18,000 scientists, engineers, astronauts, and contract officers. Everywhere I go, I see renewed energy and excitement that the President's commitment to American leadership in space has inspired. But to achieve our objectives, I came here today to say that NASA must meet that new spirit with new urgency and the focus that it all deserves. Just a few moments ago, Buzz Aldrin was reflecting on his time in the Apollo program. He talked about that fabled Apollo 11 mission. He said, in 1962, we had an objective; we had time, but we didn't have a plan. In Space Policy Directive-1, the President directed NASA to create a lunar exploration plan. But as of today, more than 15 months later, we still don't have a plan in place. But Administrator Bridenstine told me, five minutes ago, we now have a plan to return to the moon. (Applause.) The truth is, despite the dedication of the men and women who are designing and building and testing the SLS, you all know the program has been plagued by bureaucratic inertia, by what some call the ""paralysis of analysis."" The nation actually learned, with great disappointment, in recent weeks, that the date for its first flight for the SLS has been pushed back yet again, to 2021. You know, after years of cost overruns and slipped deadlines, we're actually being told that the earliest we can get back to the moon is 2028. Now, that would be 18 years after the SLS program was started and 11 years after the President of the United States directed NASA to return American astronauts to the Moon. Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not good enough. We're better than that. It took us eight years to get to the Moon the first time, 50 years ago, when we had never done it before, and it shouldn't take us 11 years to get back. You know, it's been 47 years since American astronauts last walked on the Moon. And ironically, America's first generation of space pioneers knew that it would likely take time for the next generation to return to the Moon, including one of the founders of Rocket City, Dr. Wernher von Braun. Just as it took the development of the airplane for the United States Navy to reach the South Pole, 45 years after an expedition of Norwegian explorers made history and got there in 1911, Dr. von Braun believed it would take what he called, in his words, ""enabling technology"" for us to return to the lunar surface, and that it might take just as much time to develop it. The good news is, as we will hear from our distinguished panelists today, those enabling technologies have arrived and we are going back to the Moon. (Applause.) Because of your work, because of the ingenuity, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit reflected in this room and throughout the American space enterprise, since the end of Apollo 11, we have forged incredible breakthroughs in our technology that have allowed us to go further, more safely, in space than ever before. We have the technology to return to the Moon and renew American leadership in human space exploration. What we need now is urgency. Now, make no mistake about it: We're in a space race today, just as we were in the 1960s, and the stakes are even higher. Last December, China became the first nation to land on the far side of the Moon and revealed their ambition to seize the lunar strategic high ground and become the world's preeminent spacefaring nation. And for more than seven years, without a viable human space launch program of our own, Russia has been charging the United States more than $80 million a seat every time an American astronaut travels to the International Space Station. But it's not just competition against our adversaries; we're also racing against our worst enemy: complacency. And the truth is, we've been here before. Nearly 62 years ago, the race for space began, and the Soviet Union took an early lead. But the sight of Sputnik blinking across the October sky spurred the American people to action. We refused to accept a future in space written by the enemies of freedom. We vowed to claim our rightful place as the undisputed leader in the exploration of the heavens. And 12 years later, the ""one giant leap"" occurred. We achieved our goal of American leadership in space. Now, more than 50 years later, we gather here today to say that it's up to this generation to meet the challenge of our time. And with the recommendations of this National Space Council, the recommendations that will be approved today, I believe that we are rising to meet that challenge head on. (Applause.) Just as the United States was the first nation to reach the Moon in the 20th Century, so too will be , we'd be the first nation to return astronauts to the Moon in the 21st century. And I'm here, on the President's behalf, to tell the men and women of the Marshall Space Flight Center and the American people that, at the direction of the President of the United States, it is the stated policy of this administration and the United States of America to return American astronauts to the Moon within the next five years. (Applause.) And let me be clear: The first woman and the next man on the Moon will both be American astronauts, launched by American rockets, from American soil. (Applause.) But to accomplish this, we must redouble our efforts here in Huntsville and throughout this program. We must accelerate the SLS program to meet this objective. But know this: The President has directed NASA and Administrator Jim Bridenstine to accomplish this goal by any means necessary. In order to succeed, as the Administrator will discuss today, we must focus on the mission over the means. You must consider every available option and platform to meet our goals, including industry, government, and the entire American space enterprise. Our administration is committed to this goal. And this President, this administration, and the American people are committed to achieving that goal at the Marshall Space Flight Center. (Applause.) But the truth is, we're committed to Marshall, the incredible history that you have here. But to be clear, we're not committed to any one contractor. If our current contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones that will. If American industry can provide critical commercial services without government development, then we'll buy them. And if commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the Moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be. Urgency must be our watchword. Failure to achieve our goal to return an American astronaut to the Moon in the next five years is not an option. As we will discuss today, this will require renewed focus and a relentless will to achieve our mission. And that's exactly what you have in abundance here in northern Alabama. You know, urgency has always been in the DNA of Rocket City. And the men and women of the Marshall Space Flight Center know exactly what it takes to be first , to be first in space because you've been doing it for generations. It was here where you built the Jupiter-C rocket that carried into orbit America's first satellite, Explorer 1. It was here you spent 15 grueling months executing over 200 tests of the Redstone rocket that launched America's first astronaut into space , Alan Shepard , on the Mercury 7, the ""Freedom 7″ Mercury capsule. And it was here you answered the call of the nation and stunned the world. In less than eight years, you built a rocket that carried the first men to the Moon, the mighty Saturn 5 that we see before us today. The hardworking men and women of Rocket City have always embodied the American pioneering spirit: restless energy, urgency, national pride, and impatience with anything less than the best. And we know that it will be here, in Rocket City, where America will build a new generation of rockets that will carry American astronauts back to the Moon, on to Mars, and to worlds beyond. For more than 60 years, Huntsville, Alabama, has built the finest rocket propulsion systems in the world. And we want to ensure it remains that way for the next 60 years. As we continue to push farther into our solar system, we'll need innovative new propulsion systems to get us there, including nuclear power. (Applause.) And the President and I know there's no place on Earth better equipped to lead the world in pioneering these new propulsion technologies than Rocket City, U.S.A. Now, the conventional wisdom says that we'll need more time to do what President Trump has challenged us to do: landing American astronauts on the Moon within the next five years. Some will say it's too hard, it's too risky, it's too expensive. But the same was said back in 1962 when President Kennedy boldly declared that we, in his words, ""choose to go to the Moon in this decade."" Our space program was still in its infancy then. NASA was barely two years old. And yet, President Kennedy knew that history is not written by those who stubbornly cling to the status quo. History is written by those who dare to dream big and do the impossible. (Applause.) Then, as now, the United States didn't have a rocket capable of sending a spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. But now, as then, the United States has a President who is a dreamer; who understands that this is a challenge that, once again, ""we are unwilling to postpone"" and ""one which we intend to win"" again. President Trump knows that meeting this challenge will require a great national investment of time, talent, and resources. But the costs of inaction are greater. The United States must remain first in space, in this century as in the last, not just to propel our economy and secure our nation, but above all because the rules and values of space, like every great frontier, will be written by those who have the courage to get there first and the commitment to stay. And as Americans, and as heirs of this great nation dedicated to life, to liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it's nothing less than our duty to ensure that our most cherished values are the foundation of mankind's future in space. (Applause.) President Trump is committed to building a space program worthy of our great nation. And we're going to continue to work with leaders in Congress and Senator Shelby and others to provide the Marshall Space Flight Center and all of NASA the resources they need to meet to the goal that we articulated today. But, as I said, mission success will require more than just money. And that's why, today, the National Space Council will send recommendations to the President that will launch a major course correction for NASA and reignite that spark of urgency that propelled America to the vanguard of space exploration 50 years ago. As you will hear, in these recommendations, we will call on NASA not just to adopt new policies but to embrace a new mindset. That begins with setting bold goals and staying on schedule. To reach the Moon in the next five years, we must select our destinations now. NASA already knows that the lunar South Pole holds great scientific, economic, and strategic value. But now it's time to commit to go there. And today, the National Space Council will recommend that when the first American astronauts return to the lunar surface, that they will take their first steps on the Moon's South Pole. (Applause.) But in order to accomplish this, NASA must transform itself into a leaner, more accountable, and more agile organization. If NASA is not currently capable of landing American astronauts on the Moon in five years, we need to change the organization, not the mission. To continue to build a world-class workforce, NASA needs the authority to recruit, train, and motivate the world's best and brightest scientists, engineers, and managers, and to remove any barriers standing in their way. And that includes building new and renewed partnerships with America's pioneering space companies and entrepreneurs. And in this century, we're going back to the Moon with new ambitions, not just to travel there, not just to develop technologies there, but also to mine oxygen from lunar rocks that will refuel our ships; to use nuclear power to extract water from the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole; and to fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars not in years but in months. To develop these new technologies, NASA must adopt an all-hands-on-deck approach to procurement, contracts, and its partnerships. If a commercial company can deliver a rocket, a lunar lander, or any other capability faster and at a lower cost to the taxpayer than the status quo, then NASA needs to have the authority and the courage to change course quickly and decisively to achieve that goal. (Applause.) As we proved during Apollo program, we don't need to sacrifice quality or safety to achieve speed and efficiency. We're not asking anyone to take unnecessary risks. Rather, we're challenging everyone involved in America's space enterprise to think bigger, fail smarter, and work harder than ever before. The task before us will involve sacrifice and determination, hardship and hazard. But as we embark on this journey, we would do well to remember the words spoken by the late Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the Moon. Before he boarded the lunar module 45 years ago, Gene said, and I quote, ""America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow."" As Gene Cernan knew then, the exploration of the heavens in this still-new century will go forward with or without the United States. But Americans don't do second place. Americans lead. (Applause.) And so we will. So as we convene this fifth meeting of the still newly reconstituted National Space Council, the President and I are challenging all of you here in Rocket City, and all those involved in the space enterprise that are looking on across the nation, to step up and get ready to do your part to help lead our nation into the vast expanse of space again. And as we renew our commitment to lead in space, let's go with confidence and let's go with faith. Faith in the vision and the goal that's articulated today: that we can achieve it; that Americans can achieve anything that we put our minds to. Faith in the extraordinary ingenuity and capability of the men and women of NASA and America's space enterprise, and their ability to meet those challenges if given the resources and the support to do it. And especially faith in the courage of the men and women who are now, and those who will join, the storied ranks of American astronauts , that next generation of restless pioneers that will carry American leadership into space. It's extraordinary to think of the heroes that will be forged in our renewed commitment to space. And lastly, let's have that other kind of faith as well. Let's have that faith as America renews our commitment to leadership in space, as we call on our best and brightest minds to achieve those goals and we call on our most courageous to suit up and go , that those that we send, let's have faith that they will not go alone. For as millions of Americans have cherished throughout our long and storied history of exploration by this nation, let's believe, as the Old Book says, that there's nowhere we can go from His spirit. If we rise on the wings of the dawn, if we settle on the far side of the sea, even if we ""go up to the heavens,"" there, His hand will guide us and His right hand will hold us fast. (Applause.) So thank you for the opportunity to be with you today. Thanks again to all the members of the National Space Council and all the extraordinary Americans gathered here today. I leave here with confidence that with the leadership of President Donald Trump, with our renewed commitment to space, with the courage and ingenuity of this new generation of explorers, and with God's help, that America will once against astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonder we achieve. And we will lead the world in human space exploration once again. Now let's get to work. Thank you all. (Applause.) God bless you."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1332219/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-fifth-meeting-of-the-national-space-council&speechType=1	Science		Huntsville, AL	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-fifth-meeting-national-space-council-huntsville-al/
VSMP273201918	Mike Pence	2019-03-27	Remarks by Vice President Pence and First Lady Fabiana Rosales of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Before Bila ...	statement	VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you all for being here. It's my great honor to be able to welcome the First Lady of Venezuela here to the White House. It is extraordinary to see what Fabiana and her courageous husband, Interim President Juan Guaidó, have done for freedom in Venezuela already. Now, stepping forward, recognized by the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó is the only legitimate President of Venezuela. And Venezuela is in crisis. After years of dictatorship and oppression, 9 out of 10 people in Venezuela live in poverty. Three million people in Venezuela have fled their country under the brutal regime of Nicolás Maduro. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and it is the policy of the United States of America, at the direction of President Donald Trump, that Nicolás Maduro must go. It was our great honor, when your husband took the oath of office as the legitimate President of Venezuela, to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Juan Guaidó as the President of Venezuela. But to see him and his courageous wife stand before the crowds and take that oath of office under the constitution of Venezuela was inspiring not just to people across our hemisphere and across this country, but all over the world. And to see, in the days that have followed, the way the Maduro regime has brutalized the opposition, jailed the chief of staff to President Juan Guaidó , literally on the day that humanitarian aid, under President Guaidó's leadership, was attempted to be brought into the country from Colombia, Nicolás Maduro danced in Caracas while his henchmen murdered civilians and burned medical supplies. We call on nations all across this hemisphere to join with us to stand for freedom in Venezuela. And we call on nations across the world that are supporting the corrupt regime of Nicolás Maduro to end that support. The United States views Russia's arrival of military planes this weekend as an unwelcome provocation. We call on Russia today to cease all support of the Maduro regime and stand with Juan Guaidó, stand with nations across this hemisphere and across the world until freedom is restored. But, to the First Lady of Venezuela, it's my great honor to welcome you here today, to express the admiration of President Trump, the First Family, our family, and all of the American people for the courage that you have shown and that your husband has shown on behalf of freedom. And our message, very simply, is that we're with you, and the United States is going to continue to stand with you, stand with your courageous husband, and stand with freedom-loving people in Venezuela until your libertad is restored. MS. ROSALES: (As interpreted.) I would like to thank you, Mr. Pence. And I would like to thank the international community as well, and especially the U.S. for the enormous support they have given to the Venezuelan cause. Today, in Venezuela, it is freedom or dictatorship; it is life or it is death. And those who are paying the price of this hate are the children. Children who are dying in hospitals. Children who are dying because they have no food. Eighty percent of the population in Venezuela has no power. They are trying to break our morale. They want to submerge us in eternal darkness. But let me tell you that there is light, and the light is here. So I have come here to say that we are going to keep , bring smiles to our children again. We're going to bring hope to our people again. Because, today, with my husband, what we want to do is help those mothers in Venezuela. We want children to go to school. We want children to be able to graduate. We want children to be able to play. We want people to stay at home. We want people to be able to die in their own country, in their own land. It's a question of life and death, and we want life. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We're with you. Vaya con Dios.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1332221/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-and-first-lady-fabiana-rosales-of-the-bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela-before-bilateral-meeting&speechType=6	Foreign Affairs		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-first-lady-fabiana-rosales-bolivarian-republic-venezuela-bilateral-meeting/
VSMP283201998	Mike Pence	2019-03-28	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Students at Ave Maria University	speech	"Thank you, President Towey. Thank you for , thank you for your kindness. Thank you for your friendship. I actually gave him a ride on Air Force Two just so he could make it back for this event. (Laughter.) Give a big round of applause for a man that's made an incredible difference in the life of this university , Jim Towey. (Applause.) Truly a servant leader and a humble man, and a great, great friend to everything that we cherish. Thank you all for that wonderful, warm welcome. I will tell you that that introduction was gracious and kind, but Jim knows the one I prefer is even shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order, and it's an honor to be with all of you today. (Applause.) To Chairman Timmis, to the Board of Trustees, distinguished members of the faculty, to the students of this remarkable school: It is an honor here to join you in this place, founded in fidelity to Christ, Ave Maria University. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) A special place. And allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great friend of the state of Florida, of this great university, and a champion of people of faith across this country and around the world. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as the President said at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year, in his words, ""Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides , from gaining independence, to abolition, to civil rights have been led by people of faith and started [with] prayer."" And I'm here, first and foremost, to thank the entire community here at Ave Maria University for the critical work you do to educate America's next generation of leaders, public servants, and leaders in faith all across America. Give this faculty a round of applause, will you, please? (Applause.) And as I just learned during a tour of your museum, Ave Maria instills a strong sense of responsibility and compassion, mission and self-sacrifice, in its students through its first-of-its-kind program in the world, the Mother Teresa Project. It's truly inspiring. In this academic year alone, I learned that students in the Mother Teresa Project have volunteered thousands of hours with Habitat for Humanity in local schools, in nursing homes, and in missions across the globe , from Mexico, to Uganda, to India. So thank you for putting feet on your faith, impacting this community, this state, our nation, and the world. We're proud of all of you. (Applause.) And through it all, you've carried forth the values that we share, and chief among them, the men and women of Ave Maria University have stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) You know, I've long believed that a society can be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable: the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside the most pro-life President in American history, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The record speaks for itself. In one of his first acts as President, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion or abortion providers around the world. And we recently expanded that policy just in the past few days. Here at home, President Trump signed a law making it possible for all 50 states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) The truth is , and I see it in the shining faces here at Ave Maria University , life is winning in America. Particularly more and more young people across this country are embracing the sanctity of life. But for all the progress we're making at the very moment that more Americans than ever before are embracing the sanctity of life, the truth is: Leading members of the Democratic Party across this country are embracing a radical agenda of abortion on demand. You've seen it in the newspapers. In state legislatures across the country, Democrats have endorsed late-term abortion. In fact, the Governor of Virginia openly defended infanticide just a few short weeks ago. And Democrats in the United States Senate , and you deserve to know , including every Democrat senator running for President voted, against a bill that would protect children who had been born alive. The truth is, with Democrats standing for late-term abortion, infanticide, and a culture of death, I promise you this President, our party, and this movement will always stand for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) Just like Ave Maria did, not long ago, it was just a few years ago when Ave Maria didn't bow to the dictates of the last administration. This university stood strong for conscience and values. Ave Maria spoke out against the last administration's attempt to force employers to provide health insurance plans that violated pro-life principles within Obamacare. And not only did Ave Maria University refuse to comply with that mandate, you challenged it and you won. (Applause.) And we commend you for your stand. And President Trump promised to stand with you , and we did , and all of those struggling under that HHS mandate, which is why we created a religious and moral exemption to the federal rule, so that all Americans can live out their faith freely in the healthcare system of this country. (Applause.) You know, the truth is, Obamacare restricted freedom, and it's reduced choices. And Obamacare has failed. And American families and businesses are still paying the price. We all remember the broken promises of Obamacare. They told us if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you liked your health plan, you could keep it; that if Obamacare passed, health insurance premiums would go down. But unfortunately, none of that was true. Costs have skyrocketed. Premiums on the individual market rose by more than 100 percent. Choices have plummeted. And more and more insurance companies have pulled out of the marketplace entirely. And as Obamacare fails, you deserve to know that Democrats are continuing in their quest for a government takeover of healthcare. They're opening calling for socialized medicine under the guise of Medicare for All. Well, the truth of the matter is, Medicare for All means quality healthcare for none. Socialized medicine will lead our country to ration healthcare and to government bureaucrats making the most important decisions affecting our lives and the lives of our loved ones. But as President Trump said just recently, soon the Republican Party will become known as the ""Party of Healthcare."" And we're going to have a great healthcare plan for all of the American people. (Applause.) This week, the President took a decisive step to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I want to promise you: We will never give up, we will never relent, in our effort to put American healthcare back on the path to more choices, more affordability, built on the principles of freedom and the doctor-patient relationship. That's our pledge to each of you in this rising generation. And let me assure all of you here in the Ave Maria community: You also have an ally and a champion in President Trump when it comes to our core freedoms. We will always stand with you, as we will always stand with all those who share our values. We will always defend your fundamental right to freedom. As we all learned from our youth, the United States was forged in religious freedom. Our first settlers were pilgrims who left everything and set sail for a New World; carved out a new home in the wilderness where they could practice their faith freely and without fear of persecution. And after this great nation secured our independence, the American Founders enshrined that first freedom in our First Amendment with these words: that ""Congress shall make no law respecting [the] establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" Our Founders knew that this precious liberty was not granted by government and could not be granted by government. They knew, as we know today, that we are ""endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights."" And the truth is, as I stand before you today, freedom of religion is increasingly under attack here at home. Lately, it's actually become fashionable for media elites and Hollywood liberals to mock religious belief. My own family became the target of these attacks after my wife went back to teach art at a Christian school. So let me say from my heart , not for us, but for every believer in this country: These attacks on believing Christians and Christian education are wrong, and they must stop. (Applause.) They're antithetical to our great American tradition. And, frankly, they should be rejected by every American of every faith. Now, I'm proud to say, since day one of this administration, President Trump has taken bold action to protect religious liberty and the freedom of conscience of every American of every faith tradition. In our first year, the President declared, in his words, that the ""federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs,"" and he directed the Department of Justice to develop new protections for Americans of faith. We made sure the free exercise of religion doesn't stop at the doors of our churches or houses of worship when we suspended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and we freed up the voices of religious leaders all over the country. (Applause.) Just last week, President Trump signed an executive order, as well, to ensure that America's First Amendment protections extend to every college and university campus in America. (Applause.) And I want to promise you: Wherever your countries take you from here, Ave Maria University, we will always stand with thoughtful young men and women like you across this country who deserve to live out your faith, live out your values without repercussions or persecution. There should be no ""safe zones"" from the God-given liberties of the American people. And we will stand for the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression on every campus in America. (Applause.) Now, as we defend liberty here at home, our administration has been standing strong for freedom around the world. And nowhere is that more true than in the stand that we've taken for freedom and democracy in Venezuela. Let me take this opportunity to thank a local leader, who's a national leader. He's been a champion of freedom in this hemisphere and a champion of restoring freedom and liberty and democracy for the Venezuelan people. Would you join me in thanking Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart for his outstanding leadership for freedom? (Applause.) He's been a great champion, along with both of your senators, for the restoration of freedom in Venezuela. And, Mario, we're proud and grateful , grateful for your heart for libertad. You know, the truth is Venezuela was once one of the richest and most vibrant democracies in the Western Hemisphere. By some estimates, Venezuela actually is home to the largest oil reserves in the world. But under the brutal regime of the dictator Nicolas Maduro and his socialist rule, it's become one of the poorest and most despotic countries in the world. Today, 9 out of 10 Venezuelans live in poverty. More than 3 million people have already abandoned their homes and fled the brutality of the Maduro regime. I was recently in Colombia and met with families who had fled not just the oppression but the starvation that's facing millions in that once rich country. It was heartbreaking, a story that I heard in my first trip to Colombia, of a grandmother who had gathered up her five grandchildren and made the long march across Venezuela to the Colombia border two years ago, because she said it had gotten so bad in her village that her grandchildren had to rise at four in the morning to get a ticket that they could exchange for a single piece of bread at four in the afternoon. And I'm proud to say, since early in this administration, with the strong support of leaders in Congress, President Trump has led an effort to isolate the dictator Maduro through economic and diplomatic means. The United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the rightful President of Venezuela. And now, more than 50 nations have joined us. (Applause.) Yesterday, President Trump and I met at the White House with Fabiana, the wife of Juan Guaidó. She's 26 years old , a young woman of extraordinary courage and grace. She'll meet today with our First Lady, Melania Trump, here in Florida. We told her then, in the Oval Office of the White House, the United States will continue to stand with her, with President Guaidó, and with the people of Venezuela until their libertad and democracy is restored. (Applause.) So we've been standing for freedom. For, as many of you have seen firsthand on your mission trips around the world, religious liberty is also under attack. Today, tragically, 82 percent of the world's people live in nations where religious freedom is either threatened or banned outright. The list of religious freedom violators is long. Their crimes and oppression span the width and breadth of our globe. Here in our own hemisphere, the government of Daniel Ortega is virtually waging war on the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. Government-backed mobs armed with machetes and even heavy weapons have attacked parishes and churches. Bishops and priests have been physically assaulted by their secret police. And hundreds of courageous Nicaraguans have died in the cause of freedom in the last year alone. I'll never forget the day I met one of those parish priests at a conference at the State Department. He talked about the siege of their church and how young people had come in to take shelter, and that when it was all over and the violence had ended and they left, he walked up to me and he said there was a young man in the group who described himself as an atheist. But as they were walking out of the church, he walked up to that courageous priest; he had seen his faith in action. He had seen him pray under a hail of gunfire; put himself in harm's way to protect the other young people there. And he said, that young man who said he was an atheist , said, and I quote , he said, ""Father, I don't believe in God. But if I ever believe in God, I'm going to believe in your God."" That's faith. That's courage in action. And we will stand for freedom for the people of Nicaragua, and we will stand with the people of faith in that nation. (Applause.) Farther from home, but close to our hearts, the world watched in horror earlier this month as a terrorist murdered 50 innocent Muslims at prayer in New Zealand. It was a horrific sight, and our hearts and our prayers went out and go out to every member of the community that was affected and the people of New Zealand. No one should ever fear for their safety in a place of worship , be that a mosque, or a church, or a synagogue , anywhere in the world. (Applause.) The hateful animus that motivated that killer is to be condemned universally around the world. And all of us are also witnessing the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism. It's rearing its ugly head , from Iran, to Europe, even in the halls Congress. Let me be clear on this: Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism, like every form of racism, must be confronted wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. (Applause.) The truth is, nowhere have people of faith faced greater threats than in the ancient lands where the world's three great religions were born across the Middle East. Since 2014, the brutal regime of ISIS murdered thousands of Christians and forced hundreds of thousands of them to flee their homes. And it's not just Christians. Believers of many other faiths have suffered grievously at ISIS's hands, including Muslims, Druze, and Yazidis. I met this week with the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament in my office, and we spoke of the barbarous reign of ISIS in its time and how they particularly targeted religious minorities and Christians. The good news is, President Trump promised to destroy the ISIS caliphate. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and this Commander-in-Chief, America and our allies delivered. The ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) As the world learned just last weekend, the last inch of control of the ISIS caliphate was captured by American forces and by our allies in the region. And while we've liberated millions of religious minorities and captive Christians across the Middle East from the grip of ISIS, I'm proud to tell you that we've also been helping persecuted communities rebuild their communities and their lives, and replant their roots in their ancestral homes so destroyed by war. At President Trump's direction, for the first time ever, the United States of America is providing direct support to Christians and religious minorities in the Middle East to rebuild their communities. (Applause.) As I stand before you today, we've already committed more than $340 million in aid. And, I'm proud to say, we're continuing to work with a strong range of nongovernmental organizations , NGOs, as they are known , including the great ministry of the Knights of Columbus. (Applause.) We're going to rebuild these communities. We're going to work with our partners across the Nineveh Plain, Iraq, the Kurdish region of Iraq. And we're going to see these communities come home. Religious persecution is also growing in the world's most populous nation: China. The State Department's annual International Religious Freedom report has labeled China as a religious freedom violator every year since 1999. As we stand here today, Beijing is holding possibly millions of Muslim Uighurs in so-called ""re-education camps"" in Western China. Chinese authorities have banned the sale of Christian Bibles. They've destroyed thousands of crosses and other church symbols. And they've jailed pastors. Even now, the Chinese government is using the power of cutting-edge technology to develop large-scale systems of surveillance to track its citizens , an effort that our Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback, called ""the future of repression."" These are historic human rights abuses, and I want to promise all of you: Our administration is going to continue to stand strong and speak out and work to convince China that these practices are abhorrent and they should be stopped. (Applause.) But despite the heavy hand of that government, the good news is, the good news is spreading. (Laughter.) And the truth is, nowhere in its history has the Church grown as quickly as it's growing in China. Seventy years ago, when the Communist Party took power, there were less than half a million Chinese Christians. Today, just two generations later, some estimate that there are 130 [million] Christians living throughout China, proving once again what's been true throughout the history of the Church: When persecution comes, faith grows. Persecuted Christians around the world deserve our prayers. And they will always have the support of the American people. (Applause.) As you venture out on mission trips, know that our administration will always continue to stand for liberty and religious liberty throughout the wider world. You know, it really is an honor to be with all of you , these incredible, bright shining faces here at Ave Maria University. Just think of me as a warm-up act for commencement in five weeks. (Laughter.) But I'm here to tell you this is a serious time in the life of our nation. And to stand before such impressive young men and women, it's a great honor for me and it's a privilege. The truth is, in the next 19 months, America will face a choice. And the challenge before us is not just about winning an election; we must win the next generation. And that's where you all come in. Your faith, your integrity, your character , all of which the foundation has been strengthened here at Ave Maria University , will make you leaders in the rising generation. You'll stand out. So I want to offer you a challenge: What you've seen and heard and learned in the hallways of this still-young university, carry from here as you lead lives of consequence in your generation. Live out your faith. Live out your values. ""Always be prepared,"" as the Bible tells us, ""to give a reason for the hope that you have, but do so with gentleness and respect."" On my way here, on Air Force Two, I was reading in my morning devotions the story of the farmer that went out to sow seed in Luke, Chapter 8. The story reads, ""The seed that fell on good soil, it yielded a crop 100 times more than was sown."" And I stand before this impressive group of young people, and those looking on, to say that's what you must aspire to be. It's interesting that Jesus later pulled aside his disciples and explained to them what the meaning of the parable was and how it had to do with the character of the men and women. He said, and I quote, ""The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and, by persevering, produce a crop.""So I want to challenge each one of you to act on those words in your life. First, be hearers of the word. You know, it's always struck me that Psalm 1, Psalm 19, and Psalm 119 , the first Psalm and the longest Psalm , all have to do with one idea, and that is: Read the word. Take time in your life. Blessed is a man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers, but what? His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night, and be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he or she does prospers. What a promise. So I'd just encourage you, as a fellow believer: Hear it, retain it, live it out as best you can, and persevere. I don't know if you caught that in the verse, but it said, by ""persevering"" it produced a crop. And the truth is, those of you who are willing to stand for faith and values in this rising generation, you're going to face criticism and what passes in this country for persecution. That's where your perseverance comes in, to turn your face like flint against the wind, and smile and show that conviction and show that love to everybody that you meet. You know, I'll always believe the essence of leadership is what's in your heart. People follow people that they trust. And when you know somebody's heart, you trust them. So let people see your heart and persevere. Now, my favorite President is the one I go to work with every day. (Laughter.) But one of my other favorites was Calvin Coolidge, who had some words about perseverance that I've actually got tacked to the bulletin board in our office at the Vice President's Residence, and they're really words to live by. Calvin Coolidge was a man of faith. He was also a Vice President. (Laughter.) He'd been a governor. (Laughter.) But I digress. (Laughter.) Calvin Coolidge said, and I quote, ""Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ""Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."" So I encourage you to press on and know that you can make a difference. Be men and women with good and noble hearts. Store up God's word in those hearts. Retain it and preserve. And remember the words I read a little bit later in Luke, Chapter 8, as well. There's a reason you're here. There's a reason all of you have been blessed with an education of this magnitude with such a solid foundation and timeless values, and to the ideals that have made this country great. I think it can be found in the rest of that chapter to remember no one , ""No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar and puts it under a bed. Instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see [it]."" When you leave here and you leave Ave Maria University, let your light shine. You'll make a difference in the life of this nation and in the world. So thank you for the honor of addressing all of you today. The future beckons, and I believe it will be a future where we , with men and women in this rising generation, where we recommit ourselves to all the ideals that have always made this country strong and prosperous and secure and free. It's going to be a foundation forged on our most cherished institutions of faith and family and freedom. I believe it with all my heart. I see it happening all over the country, everywhere I go. And as you do that, as you step out as leaders, I just saw, a few moments ago, one last admonition from Mother Teresa, and I'm going to take it back with me. She said, ""At the end of life, we will not be judged by how many diplomas we've received, how much money we've made, [or] how many great things we have done. We will be judged by ""I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was naked, and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.'"" Be men and women of compassion, men and women of conviction. Be men and women who are leading in this generation. And I know that, as you live out that high calling , with your example, with your lives of consequence, with great institutions like Ave Maria University, with strong leaders elected at every level around the country who share our values, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help , I know we're just getting started. And we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1332229/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-students-at-ave-maria-university&speechType=1	Religion Foreign Affairs Health and Health Care			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-students-ave-maria-university-ave-maria-fl/
VSMP303201997	Mike Pence	2019-03-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Faith Leaders with Senator Lindsey Graham	speech	"Well, thank you, Senator Graham. Thank you for that overly generous introduction. Lindsey and I have known each other a long time. And he knows me well enough to know that the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. (Applause.) And it's an honor to be with all of you today. To Dr. Roberts, Pastor Stafford, Chad Connelly, and to all of you, it is deeply humbling for us to join so many religious leaders from across South Carolina, here at the ""Mother Church of Greenville,"" Brushy Creek Baptist Church. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. (Applause.) And let me mention another friend of mine. I spoke to him this morning before we got on the plane and headed this way. And told him I was going to be in South Carolina today, and he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of religious liberty and people of faith in America and across the wider world. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's also a great honor today to be joined by two strong supporters of this administration and great friends of ours. And I want to thank them for hosting us here in South Carolina, and, frankly, for doing an amazing job leading this state. Governor Henry McMaster and First Lady Peggy McMaster, thank you so much for being with us today. (Applause.) And I always think it's proper to introduce the highest- ranking official last. So join me in welcoming my wife of 33 years. (Laughter.) She's a Marine Corps mom. She's an advocate for military families. She's even an art teacher at a Christian school. Would you join me welcoming the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. (Applause.) Isn't she great? You know, the President said many times that the United States is, in his words, a ""nation of faith."" And the leaders in this sanctuary live that out every day. You minister to thousands of people across South Carolina. You rightly handle the word of truth. You preach the word ""in season and out of season."" And you address the spiritual and practical needs of your congregations. And the churches you represent I know make a profound impact on the life of this community, this state, and this nation. In fact, I learned on my way in that our hosts today here at the Brushy Creek Baptist Church have been spreading the word since the days of our nation's first President, George Washington. And I'm told that just last week, this church celebrated its 225th anniversary. Would you join me in giving a big round of applause for this bedrock of the Christian faith here in South Carolina? (Applause.) It's amazing. Brushy Creek Baptist Church was founded, I'm told, with just five members. Because of your tireless dedication to the Gospel over the generations, now more than 3,000 people live out your mission to ""rescue, [to] grow, and [to] serve"" here in South Carolina. And today, churches in the farthest corners of the globe are thriving thanks to your faith and generosity. And you have our thanks and admiration. I have no doubt that each of you representing so many ministries from across this region have the same kind of impact in your communities, the same impact on our nation and the world at large. And I believe with all my heart that your faith is moving mountains and your witness is changing lives every day. And I know what I'm talking about. You know, I was raised in a churched home. It was grace before dinner and church on Sunday morning. But 40 years ago last spring, everything changed for me. I heard the message that all of you speak so faithfully from pulpits and in coffee shops and in conversations every day. I heard that ""God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes would not perish."" And that day I walked down at a little Christian concert in Asbury, Kentucky, and I put my faith in Jesus Christ as my lord and savior. And he has made all the difference. (Applause.) He has. He has. So thank you for the work that you're doing in the lives of people across this community every day and he way you're changing hearts. Truly, you're renewing South Carolina every day. In fact, as I stand before you today, as Senator Graham just reflected, I believe we're in the midst of a great renewal and a fresh beginning all across this country. You know, it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who gets up every day to renew the greatness of America. That is President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I mean, think about it. The Senator just spoke about this, but the President promised to revive the American economy, and with the strong support of leaders like both of your senators, we've cut red tape, unleashed American energy, forged new trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And this President kept his word to the American people when he signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) And the American economy is roaring. The results have been nothing short of extraordinary. You've seen it here all across South Carolina, and it's happening all across America. In just two years, businesses large and small across this country have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than 490,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs. The stock market is soaring. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. And the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. And it's the lowest ever recorded for African Americans or Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is working for every American once again. (Applause.) It's true. And probably most meaningful among all the statistics for the President and me is that while wages are rising at the fastest pace that they have in a decade, they are rising most rapidly for blue-collar Americans. I mean, the truth of the matter is that the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. This economy is working for everybody. (Applause.) And to ensure our continued growth, we all know that we have to secure the blessings of liberty with a strong national defense. And I can promise you this President and this senator have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. And from the first days of this administration, we've worked to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We're rebuilding our military. We're restoring the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) And we're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. We're keeping that solemn pledge. (Applause.) With that renewed military strength, the United States is once again standing as leader of the free world. We're standing with our allies and we're standing up to our enemies. American strength has brought the rogue regime in North Korea to the negotiating table. We've stood strong for the restoration of freedom and democracy in Venezuela. And with the courage of our extraordinary armed forces, we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. And thanks to our fighting men and women and our allies, one week ago today, the last inch of ground controlled by the Islamic State was liberated. The ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) So we've stood up to our enemies but we've stood with our allies. And that includes our most cherish ally. You know, for decades, one administration after another promised , promised to our most cherish ally that we would recognize their capital in the same way that we've recognized every capital of every sovereign nation on Earth. But President Trump made history when he announced, a little more than a year ago, that we were moving the United States embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. (Applause.) He made history. And just a week ago, he did it again, with the strong support of Senator Lindsey Graham on the floor of the United States Senate. After generations of leaders who recognized that the Golan Heights are critical to the security of the State of Israel, earlier this week, for the first time in 52 years, with Prime Minister Netanyahu at our side, President Trump formally recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. (Applause.) You know, the President said, ""Israel is an inspiration, a trusted ally, and a cherished friend. The United States will always stand by its side."" And I have to tell you, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.) So we're restoring American strength at home and abroad, but in this White House, we know that America's strength ultimately comes from the foundation of our most cherished values. If the foundations crumble, how can a nation stand? And from early in this administration, President Trump has stood with people of faith and stood for our most cherished freedoms. To protect these freedoms, the President has been appointing strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. In fact, in the first two years of this administration, President Trump, with the strong support of Republican majorities in the Senate, saw more conservatives confirmed to our federal courts of appeals than any President in American history. (Applause.) And even if he wasn't here with us today, I would take a moment to give special thanks to a tremendous partner of this administration who's stood with our administration, standing up for President Trump's conservative judicial nominees. And now he is the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Would you all join me in thanking Senator Lindsey Graham for his strong stand for the Constitution and for all of President Trump's appointees to the courts? (Applause.) Thank you. Thanks. Extraordinary to think about the difference on our courts. More than 80 federal judges, and they're conservatives all. I'll tell you, they're men and women that are going to stand by the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights, like the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And beyond all those 80 judges, that doesn't even include Justice Neil Gorsuch or Justice Brett Kavanaugh. (Applause.) You know, I know America will never forget the force of the words of Senator Graham during the Kavanaugh hearing. And I know here, in South Carolina, you'll never forget it as well. It was an extraordinary hearing to watch as a good man was treated so badly by Democrats on the committee. And your senator called that spectacle exactly what it was: a ""despicable thing,"" and in his words, the ""most unethical sham since [he's] been in politics."" Lindsey Graham stood strong, and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. (Applause.) So thank you, Lindsey. Our courts are stronger and our Constitution is more secure with President Donald Trump in the White House and with strong conservative leaders in the United States Senate, like your senator. And with his strong leadership, we're going to continue to appoint even more judges. And I promise you they'll all going to be men and women who interpret the Constitution as written and uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined there. You know, the truth of the matter is , the truth of the matter is I've also long believed that a society can be judged by how it deals the most vulnerable: the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. And I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) And he does. In one of his very first acts after inauguration, the President reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion or abortion providers around the world. And just this week, our administration took steps to expand it even more around the world. And here at home, it was my great honor, with the strong support of both of your senators, to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate that sent a bill to the President's desk that would allow South Carolina and all 50 states to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) And for all the progress we're making, it's remarkable to think, at the very moment that more Americans , especially young Americans , are embracing the right to life, leading members of the Democratic Party are embracing a radical agenda of abortion on demand. And the people of South Carolina deserve to know it. In state legislatures across the country, Democrats have endorsed late-term abortion. We all saw how the Democrat governor of Virginia openly defended infanticide. And last month, Democrats in the Senate, including every Democrat senator running for president, voted against a bill that would prevent newborn babies who survived failed abortions from being killed. With Democrats standing for late-term abortion, infanticide, and a culture of death, I'll promise you: This President, your senators, our party, will always stand for the sanctity of human life. We will always stand with the unborn. (Applause.) And to all the champions of faith here today, let me assure you: You have an ally in President Donald Trump. We'll always stand with you and with all who share your values. And we will always defend your fundamental right to religious liberty and to live out your faith. You know, after this great nation secured our independence, the American Founders enshrined what I believe was our first freedom in the First Amendment with the words that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" Our Founders knew this precious liberty is not granted by government. It is ""endowed by our Creator"" to every man and woman and child in America and the world. (Applause.) But the truth is, the freedom of religion is increasingly under attack here at home. Lately, it's actually become fashionable for media elites and Hollywood liberals to mock religious belief. My own family was the target of these attacks after Karen went back to teach art to children at a Christian school. So let me say from my heart, these attacks on believing Christians and Christian education are wrong and they must stop. (Applause.) They're antithetical to our great American tradition and they should be condemned by every American of every faith. And I'm proud to say that since the first day of this administration, President Trump has taken bold action to protect the religious liberty and conscience rights of every American of every faith tradition. In our first year in office, the President declared in his words that, quote, the ""federal government will never, ever penalize any person for their protected religious beliefs."" And we directed the Department of Justice to develop new protections for Americans of faith. We made sure the free exercise of religion doesn't stop at the front door of our churches or houses of worship when suspended the Johnson Amendment. Now the freedom of speech extends to every pulpit and every sanctuary in America. (Applause.) And just last week, President Trump signed an executive order to ensure that America's First Amendment protections extend to every college and university campus in America. We'll always stand with courageous young men and women across the country who deserve to live out their faith without repercussion on the campuses of this country. And as we defend our religious liberty here at home, I can assure you, with the strong support of Senator Graham, our administration has been standing strong for religious liberty around the world. Today, tragically, 83 percent of the world's population live in nations where religious freedom is either threatened or banned outright. The list of religious freedom violators is long and merits our attention and prayer. Crimes and oppressions span the width and breadth of our globe. Here in our own hemisphere, the government of Daniel Ortega is virtually waging war on the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. Government-backed mobs armed with machetes, and even heavy weapons, recently attacked parishes and churches. Bishops and priests have been physically assaulted by police. And hundreds of courageous Nicaraguans have died in the cause of freedom in the last year alone. Last summer, I had the privilege at a conference at the State Department to meet Father Raul Zamora, the parish priest of the Divine Mercy Church. An extraordinary man of faith. Just a week before we met, his church had been attacked by the Ortega government, and some 200 students had sought shelter there. And I'll never forget the story he told me of that day. His courage was evidence. He literally put himself in harm's way to protect those students for more than 15 hours. He prayed with them through the night as bullets rang against the walls and through the windows. He risked his own life to help negotiate a ceasefire and eventually the students' release. But Father Zamora told me a story that day, that as he and the students were walking out of the church, a young man who described himself as an atheist walked up to him and took him by the hand. And he said these words , he said, ""Father, I don't believe in God. But if I ever believe in God, I'm going to believe in your God."" That's a testimony. That's a witness of faith and courage that will change the world. As I told Father Zamora, we'll remain committed to supporting the people of Nicaragua in their struggle for freedom, and we always will. Farther from home, but closer to our hearts, the world watched in horror earlier this month as an evil white supremacist murdered 15 [50] innocent Muslims at prayer in New Zealand. It was a travesty. An atrocity. It grieved the hearts of people around the world. No one should ever fear for their safety in a place of worship, be that a mosque, a church, or a synagogue, anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And the truth is, we witness every day that anti-Semitism is once again on the rise, on the world and even here at home. Anti-Semitism is not just wrong, it's evil. And anti-Semitism must be confronted and condemned wherever it arises, whenever and whoever breathes it out. (Applause.) But nowhere have people of faith faced greater threats than in the ancient lands where the world's three great religions were born, across the Middle East , an area that your senator knows very well and has traveled to on innumerable occasions. Since 2014, it is remarkable to think , one week after the ISIS caliphate and its territory were recaptured, to reflect on the fact that, over the last five years, ISIS has murdered thousands of Christians, forced hundreds of thousands of them to flee from their native communities and their homes and their nations. And it's not just been Christians who felt the brutality of ISIS; believers of many other faiths suffered grievously at ISIS's hands, including Muslims, Druze, Yazidis. And as I said earlier, this President promised to destroy the ISIS caliphate, and the ISIS caliphate is now destroyed. But while we've liberated millions of captive Christians and religious minorities across the Middle East, I'm proud to report to each one of you that we're also helping these communities rebuild their lives and replant their roots in their ancient and ancestral homes as never before. At President Trump's direction, for the first time ever, the United States of America is providing direct financial support to Christians and religious minorities rebuilding their communities across the Middle East. (Applause.) It's happening. We've already committed more than $340 million to their aid under the President's leadership. And the truth is, we're just getting started to restore the vibrant diversity of faith across the ancient world. And also, finally, religious persecution is growing in the world's most populous country as well. The State Department's annual International Religious Freedom report labeled China as a religious freedom violator every year since 1999. As many of you know, Chinese authorities have banned the sale of Christian Bibles; they've destroyed thousands of crosses and other Church symbols; and they have jailed Christian pastors. And let me make you a promise: As we work toward a more free and fair trading relationship with China, our administration will continue to stand strong with people of faith in China. And we will work to convince China to lift the heavy hand of government from the church. (Applause.) Persecuted Christians around the world deserve your prayers. And I know they have them. But I want to promise you: Under this administration, they will always have the support of the American people as well. It's really wonderful for us to be with you today, and we're grateful that all of you would take time on a beautiful Saturday to come out. Your presence here is an encouragement to us and deeply humbling. You know, the President and I share one conviction, and that is: The sweetest words we ever hear are when people reach across a rope line or stop us on a street corner and say, ""I'm praying for you."" And you can always tell when people mean it. Those of you in ministry know what I'm talking about. When that person looks at you and they say it with a conviction that you know comes straight from their heart, you know that they're taking your name before the throne of grace, and it's deeply humbling. I invariably respond to people that we feel it every day. And we do, don't we? You know, the Bible says, ""I urge that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people and all those in authority."" So let me say thank you. Thank you for your prayers. We feel them every day. (Applause.) But as you pray for those of us in positions of authority that have been entrusted by the American people in our positions, I also encourage you, in these too divided of times across this country, to just pray for America. Pray for all the people of America. Because I truly do believe that those ancient words that have seen our nation through much more challenging times than we could imagine in our time are every bit as true today: That if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this country. He'll hear from Heaven and He'll heal this land , (applause) , this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So keep on praying. At home and abroad, I'll promise you, President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right. But as I close, let me say we also recognize that the most important work in America doesn't happen in the White House, on Capitol Hill, or in any public office for that matter. I can assure you the President and I know the most meaningful work , the transformative work in this country , happens in places just like this; it happens in houses of worship and in the hearts of the American people. We know the truth is no podium the President and I ever stand behind will be of greater consequence than your pulpits. No policy we ever enact will be more meaningful than the ministries that you lead. No action will , we take will ever be more powerful than the love and compassion and the prayers for the American people. So thank you for the honor of addressing you. Keep changing hearts. Keep reaching people all across this community, and this state, this nation, and this world. Keep changing lives. And we'll keep making American great again. Thanks everybody. God bless you. And God bless America.

VSMP34201996	Mike Pence	2019-04-03	Remarks by Vice President Pence at NATO Engages: The Alliance at 70	speech	"Well, thank you all. Thank you for that warm welcome. And Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison has been saying ""yes"" to America for a long time. Would you join me in thanking the permanent representative to NATO for her extraordinary service to the United States of America and those overly generous words? (Applause.) To the Ambassador, to General Jones, your excellences, to all of you who support and uphold the transatlantic alliance every day. It's a great privilege for me to be here on behalf of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump, to join the Atlantic Council, the German Marshall Fund, and the Munich Security Conference as we mark the 70th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The alliance at 70 has never been stronger. (Applause.) We gather today at a historic time. Tomorrow marks 70 years since the United States and 11 of our allies, in this very city, signed the North Atlantic Treaty and committed ourselves to ""safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of [our] peoples."" A heritage ""founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law."" In the 70 years since, the United States has kept our commitments and we've urged European allies to do the same all along the way. And as President Trump said yesterday when he met Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office, in the last two years, in his words, ""Tremendous progress has been made, and NATO is much stronger"" because of the progress we have made together. (Applause.) With the support of strong bipartisan majorities in the United States Congress, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. We've enacted the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We released a National Security Strategy advancing peace through strength. At the President's direction, we initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal and, in January of this year, unveiled our nation's new strategy for missile defense. A strong military, of course, depends on a strong economy in all the nations of this alliance. And under this President, in the United States we've taken decisive action to strengthen the American economy. We've enacted the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history, rolled back regulation at a record pace, forged reciprocal trade deals, and unleashed American energy as never before. The results in our country have truly been remarkable. In just two years, I'm proud to report, the United States has seen businesses large and small create 5.3 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Our stock market is soaring. We're the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And there's more Americans working today than ever before in our nation's history. With that renewed American strength, our transatlantic alliance is being defended and being renewed every day. (Applause.) Together with our NATO partners, we created the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force to prepare combat-ready battlegroups to be able to move into the Baltics and Poland within days. We began the Four Thirties initiative, which, by 2020, aims to ready 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons, 30 warships for deployment within 30 days. To ensure the swift movement of our troops, we are creating new NATO commands in Virginia and Ulm, Germany. And Norfolk, Virginia, is the proud new home of NATO's focus on the future, the Allied Command Transformation Center, which is tasked with assessing the latest global trends and devising the ability to meet them and match them. And just last fall, NATO conducted its biggest joint exercise since the end of the Cold War: Trident Juncture. You know, NATO is stronger today because of the support of all of our allies. As he was leaving the podium just a few short minutes ago, Secretary General Stoltenberg reached up to me at the end of his speech, took my hand, and said, ""I said NATO was stronger."" And I said, ""Yes, you did."" And the truth is, NATO today , because of the commitment of our allies but also because of the resolute American leadership of President Donald Trump and our transatlantic alliance , has made remarkable progress for our collective security under that leadership. Think about it: We've taken the fight to radical Islamist terrorists on our terms, on their soil. In Iraq and Syria, President Trump gave American commanders in the field the authority they needed to hit ISIS and drive them back. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces and the efforts of our 78 coalition partners, the ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) Beyond the Middle East, in the fall of 2017, President Trump announced our South Asia strategy. And with a renewed commitment of United States Armed Forces and our NATO Allies, we've taken the fight with renewed vigor to the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS Khorasan, and other Islamist extremist groups in Afghanistan. And thanks to their courageous efforts and sacrifice, we are now talking to the Taliban about a future settlement that will ensure that Afghanistan is never again used by terrorists to launch an attack against the United States, our allies, or any sovereign nation in the world. Under President Donald Trump, I promise you, the United States will seize every opportunity to achieve peace. But we will approach every challenge to our transatlantic alliance with strength. Under President Trump's leadership, we've been holding Russia accountable for its attempts to redraw international borders by force, approving the largest provision of defense weapons to Ukraine in years. The United States also expelled 60 diplomats following a chemical weapons attack on a Russian exile on British soil, and most of our allies did the same in a clear statement of resolve against such violence. And after years of Russian violations of our decades-old treaty, the United States, with the unanimous support of our NATO Allies, announced plans to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Last December, NATO declared that Russia had developed and fielded a missile system that poses significant risks to NATO members and was in direct violation of its commitments under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. At the urging of our NATO Allies, America remained open to an ongoing dialogue with Russia in the hopes that she could see her way clear to full INF compliance. But Russia refused to live up to its own treaty obligations , refused to respond to the concerns of the United States and our Allies in NATO. And today, Russia continues to refuse to dismantle its non-compliant new missile systems. In response to Russia's material breach, President Trump made the decision , in fact, had no choice but to provide the requisite six-month written notice to treaty parties of our intention to withdraw under Article XV of the INF Treaty. The United States was forced to take this action due to the significant risk posed to NATO member states by Russia's covert testing, production, and deployment of non-INF compliant ground-launched cruise missile systems. Unless Russia honors its INF Treaty obligations and agrees to the verifiable destruction of all the violating missile systems, Russia will bear the sole responsibility for America's withdrawal within the next six months. (Applause.) Now, while President Trump remains open to effective international arms control, disarmament, non-proliferation, the United States will no longer agree to any measure or any treaties that force unilateral disarmament on us or our allies. (Applause.) Now, the United States is grateful for NATO's readiness to take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility and effectiveness of our great alliance's deterrence and defense posture. And so we've been making historic investments in our national defense and in NATO. The truth is, America is leading on the world stage once again. But, you know, part of leadership is being as good as your word and holding your friends to their word. In 2014, at the NATO summit in Wales, all of our allies agreed, of their own accord, to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. The United States has done all that and more , well more than our fair share. We make up more than two-thirds of NATO members' combined defense budgets. In 2017, at the NATO Summit, President Trump was very direct with members of our alliance when he called on NATO members to, in his words, ""contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations."" He pointed out, at the time, that ""23 of the 28 member nations [were] still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for [our common] defense."" As the President said then, this is not fair to the American people or the United States of America. In fact, President Trump was hardly the first American President to make this point. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy said, and I quote, ""We cannot continue to pay for the military protection of Europe while NATO states are not paying their fair share."" President Kennedy went on to say, ""We have been very generous to Europe and it is now time for us to look out for ourselves."" Now, we're aware that the President's strong leadership has caused consternation among some in our alliance. I recall meeting with the prime minister of one of our member nations, during our first year in office. He expressed his concern, and he told me how important it was that America remained the leader of the free world. And I told him what I tell you now: That when President Donald Trump calls on our NATO Allies to live up to their word, to live up to the commitments that they've made to our common defense, that's what we call being ""leader of the free world."" (Applause.) Even two of NATO's strongest defenders , both former ambassadors to NATO under the last two administrations , wrote in today's Washington Post, and I quote, ""Low European defense spending is indeed a problem for NATO's future."" And they're right. The good news is, at President Trump's urging, our NATO Allies have stepped up, have already promised $100 billion more in additional defense spending, and more of our NATO Allies are meeting the 2 percent commitment. The majority of NATO members now have plans in place to meet their financial obligations by 2024. As the Secretary General said just hours ago before Congress, President Trump's leadership on burden sharing is ""having a real impact"" to the benefit of NATO and the free world. (Applause.) And so, more of our allies are now meeting their commitments, but still too many others are falling short. And as we all acknowledge, Germany is chief among them. Germany is Europe's largest and healthiest economy. It's a leading global exporter and has benefitted from U.S. protection of Europe for generations. But last year's annual report to parliament on the state of the German armed forces revealed glaring deficiencies in Germany's military readiness. And yet, as we stand here today, Germany still refuses to make the necessary investment of 2 percent of its GDP to our common defense. After great prodding, it agreed to spend only 1.5 percent of its GDP on defense by 2024. But the draft budget for 2019 just presented to the German parliament actually falls short of even that commitment, promising only 1.3 percent. Germany must do more. And we cannot ensure the defense of the West if our allies grow dependent on the Russia. If Germany persists in building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, as President Trump has said, it could turn Germany's economy into literally a ""captive of Russia."" It is simply unacceptable for Europe's largest economy to continue to ignore the threat of Russian aggression and neglect its own self-defense and our common defense at such a level. And it's also wrong for Germany to allow itself to become energy dependent on Russia. NATO is a mutual defense pact, not a unilateral security agreement. We need all allies to contribute to this joint endeavor, and we honor their commitments and we'll keep ours. The United States expects every NATO member to fulfill their own commitments and to meet the 2 percent threshold no later than 2024. And we expect all our allies to invest 20 percent of defense spending on major new equipment. And we're greatly encouraged at the progress that's being made among many of our allies to do just that. We've also made it clear that we'll not stand idly by while NATO Allies purchase weapons from our adversaries , weapons that threaten the very cohesion of this alliance. Turkey's purchase of a $2.5 billion S-400 anti-aircraft missile system from Russia poses great danger to NATO and to the strength of this alliance. The fact that Turkey is moving ahead with these plans even after the United States has made available the Patriot air defense system is deeply troubling. The Pentagon made clear, earlier this week, and I repeat today: If Turkey completes its purchase of the Russian S-400 missile system, Turkey risks expulsion from the joint F-35 program, which will harm not just Turkey's defense capacity, but it may cripple many of the Turkish component manufacturers that supply that program. In the meantime, this week we formally notified the Turkish government that the United States is immediately suspending shipments of all F-35 Joint Strike Fighter related equipment and materiel to Turkey. Turkey must choose: Does it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history of the world? Or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance? Perhaps the greatest challenge NATO will face in the coming decades is how we must all adjust to the rise of the People's Republic of China. And adjust we must. For determining how to meet the challenge of Chinese 5G technology, meet the challenge of the easy money offered by China's Belt and Road Initiative, is a challenge European allies must contend with every day. Whether we like it or not, the implications of China's rise will profoundly affect the choices NATO members will face, individually and collectively. China's expanding influence will necessarily demand more of America's attention and resources. And as we meet that challenge, our European allies must do more to maintain the strength and deterrence of our transatlantic alliance with their resources. Toward that end, we are grateful that NATO members are opening their own diplomatic dialogues with like-minded Indo-Pacific countries like Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Korea. And we welcome recent steps by NATO partners, France and Great Britain, to increase freedom-of-navigation and overflight operations in the Indo-Pacific. By working together, we can maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific where independent nations boldly pursue their own interests; respect their neighbors as equals; and where societies, beliefs, and traditions flourish side by side; and where all their citizens are able to exercise their God-given liberties and pursue their dreams. NATO's 29 member states encompass almost a billion people, who together produce almost half of the world's GDP. This extraordinary alliance is facing the next 70 years with 70 years of hard-won experience, success, and strong relationships. And so while the challenges before us loom large, with renewed American leadership on the world stage, together we're demonstrating every day that we can make the future of the free world brighter than ever before. And as we rise to meet these challenges in the days ahead, we should never underestimate our power to change the world for the better. It's what we've proven over the last 70 years, and what I believe with all my heart we'll prove for the next 70. When we're strong, when we're united, we've proven there's nothing that freedom-loving nations can't achieve. Our strength, and that of this alliance, is derived not solely from a strength of arms, though. It is ultimately born of our shared principles, the principles and ideals that we cherish: freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law. Every member nation understands these are the wellsprings of our strength and they are the wellspring of theirs. And they come from that timeless notion of unalienable rights, of life and liberty, and a notion that they're not granted to us by sovereigns or governments or kings, but they are, as the America's Founders observed, endowed by our Creator.Marshaling the will to confront the challenges of the 21st century will require faith in these timeless ideals. This then is our cause. It's why NATO exists. It's why, after so many centuries of strife and division, Europe is whole and free. For seven decades, the United States has stood with our European allies to defend our way of life against an array of threats large and small. When the ravages of war left a continent in ruins, we worked together to rebuild Europe. When the specter of communism was at Europe's door, we stood arm-in-arm against the Soviet menace. When the Berlin Wall fell and the old Soviet empire crumbled, we welcomed new democracies of Eastern Europe into our ranks. And of the eight countries that once made up the Warsaw Pact, seven now belong to NATO. And the eighth, the Soviet Union, doesn't even exist. Over the past five centuries, it's extraordinary to think that the average alliance among nations lasted no more than 15 years. But for 40 years, NATO stood strong against the communist threat of the Soviet Union. And through the strength of our resolve and by the grace of God, we prevailed against it through those 40, and now we stand for freedom to tomorrow's day of 70. The United States has been faithful to Europe for generations, and we'll keep the faith. We'll keep the faith that drove our forefathers to sacrifice so much in the defense of freedom. We share a past. We built it together. And we share a future. Today, tomorrow, and every day, you can be confident the United States of America is now and will always be Europe's greatest ally. (Applause.) As President Trump said in Poland two years ago, in his words, ""Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory."" And they also depend on a foundation of faith. And on that faith, I know, as the President said that day, ""The West will never ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive. And our civilization will triumph."" I have faith in our people and in freedom-loving people everywhere. And I also have faith that, as we advance the principles of freedom, as freedom takes hold, that where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. That means freedom always wins. So thank you. Thank you for the honor of joining you on the eve of this extraordinary anniversary. God bless you all. God bless all of our allies. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1334338/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-nato-engages-the-alliance-at-70&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-nato-engages-alliance-70/
VSMP54201995	Mike Pence	2019-04-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Homeland Security Investigation and ICE Agents	speech	"Well, thank you, Special Agent Dawson. It is an honor to be here with you, with so many extraordinary, courageous Americans. To Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for your great leadership and support. Congressman Brady, Congressman Crenshaw, Lieutenant Governor Patrick , but most especially, to all of the courageous men and women of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement: Thank you for your service. We are proud of you and we are with you. (Applause.) And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who is a great admirer of the extraordinary men and women of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, who has been a champion of the rule of law and supporter of all of those who enforce our immigration laws , I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today among all of you , who he likes to call ""incredible people"" , just to, first and foremost, say thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for the difference that you make in the life of our nation and the way you advance the safety and security of this community here in Houston, the state of Texas, and the nation as whole. Your leadership, your courageous service makes a difference every single day. It is remarkable to think: Sixteen years in the making, this agency has served the United States with great distinction and great courage. Twenty thousand American patriots like those of you gathered here comprise this organization. And in 2018 alone, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents and officers made more than 34,000 criminal arrests , the most in any single year. And America is safer because of ICE. (Applause.) Together, ICE agents removed 3,600 gang members from our streets, including 900 criminals affiliated with MS-13. You seized nearly 10,000 pounds of opioids before they could make their way to our communities large and small and tear at the very fabric of families and deliver hardship and heartache to families all across this nation. You know, the heartbreak that never happens, the crimes that never happen, never make it in the paper. But I want to assure you that this President, his Vice President, these extraordinary public officials who are here with us today know that, every day, ICE makes Houston and Texas and America safer. And you have our gratitude and our thanks. (Applause.) Now, unfortunately the field offices in Texas are some of the busiest in the country and we understand that. And I want to let you all know that we couldn't be more proud of the efforts that all of you make in a challenging environment. Some 1,200 miles of the southern border here in Texas , and, in the midst of a crisis on our southern border, the challenges are greater than ever. And , but you all have stepped up and done extraordinary work. I want to say we're particularly proud of your colleagues, just this week, in the Dallas office of ICE Homeland Security Investigations , arrested more than 280 people in the largest worksite operation at a single site in the last 10 years, upholding the laws of our land. So our thanks to the Dallas office. (Applause.) But here in Houston, the record is equally remarkable. In 2018, you arrested more than 14,000 illegal aliens, including more than 13,000 with criminal records. Your fugitive operations team focused on cases involving gangmembers, sex offenders, violent criminals; and, in 2018, arrested more than a thousand illegal aliens who posed a serious threat to national security and the safety of our nation. In fact, I'm told, just last week, ERO Houston arrested an illegal alien who's wanted for homicide in the Honduras. And the people of Houston and Texas are safer as a result of even that single apprehension. And not to be outdone, Homeland Security Investigations has already distinguished itself as well here in Houston. I'm told HSI Houston initiated more than 1,200 criminal investigations last year, resulting in the arrest of more than 1,300 human traffickers, drug smugglers, and gang members. So thank you to HIS Houston as well for the extraordinary work that you've done. (Applause.) The stories are too many to tell, but I like to tell a few of them. (Laughter.) We're joined today by a Special Agent, an online undercover agent for HSI. I'm told that he's one of the best. He's working on investigating child exploitation and human trafficking. And we just heard from one of your distinguished members of Congress that Texas, tragically , Texas, tragically, has become , and this city has become a hub of the vile trade of human trafficking and sex trafficking. This Special Agent is routinely called on for expert support by law enforcement agencies all across Texas and all across America. So would you join me in thank Special Agent Heath Hardwick? Where are you, Heath? (Applause.) Thank you for your work. Great job. Heath does more to help lock up criminals who exploit children and vulnerable families each and every day. And we couldn't be more proud, also, of your efforts to educate , to educate students and parents and teachers about how to protect our kids in the digital age. Well done. We're also joined by a deportation officer and program officer. I'm told the person first aspired to become a doctor. Went to medical school in Mexico 40 years ago, but then discovered a passion for wearing the uniform of law enforcement. As one former supervisor said, for more than three decades, he's treated every assignment like it's the most important work. And that's a work ethic that I know drives this office every single day. Join me in thanking Rogelio Gutierrez for an outstanding job protecting our community. Where are you, Rogelio? (Applause.) Great job. We could go on, and, frankly, I know we could name everybody in this room. And it'd be my honor to do it. But just know that, in recognizing these two extraordinary agents, that we're recognizing each and every one of you for the work that you do and the risks that you take each and every day. And the American people and the people of Texas deserve to know that, as you serve selflessly, as you consider our lives more important than your own, the truth of the matter is, this is a very challenging time for people in ICE. Across the country and even here in Texas, the heroes of ICE have been targeted not only by protests but by online harassment. ICE officers and leadership have had their personal information shared and social media. That's led to threats against you and your families. It's truly extraordinary. Now let me be clear: The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protests. But the threats and attempts to intimidate ICE officers and their families must stop, and they must stop right now. (Applause.) The sad fact is that your job is more challenging than ever. That's the reason I'm here in Texas today; it's the reason President Trump is in California today, because we want you to know that we're with you. You saw this President take strong measures, working with these members of Congress, to secure funding to end the crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. But you all see the headlines as much as any other American does. You all live it here in these offices and in your assignments every day. You don't need me to tell you we've got a crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border and it's different than anything that we've ever seen before. For the first time in the history of this country, the majority of people , some 4,000 in a single day last week , the majority of people coming across our southern border are families and unaccompanied minors who are being enticed to make the long and dangerous journey north by drug cartels and human traffickers who would exploit them and exploit the loopholes in our laws. And now, here, the Houston office and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement is dealing with a wave not only of the people that are coming across the border that we apprehend that make a claim for asylum to try and gain entry into our country to exploit programs in our laws like catch and release that allow people to apply for asylum and then disappear into America that you all know better than me , it's not just the people that we stop at our border. It's the people that we're not stopping as we deal with an avalanche of families and vulnerable children coming across our southern border. You saw the President of the United States take action. We stood strong in the Congress of the United States and President Trump declared a national emergency. And we have secured the funding and have already started to build new wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) The President will be reviewing some of that , those new structures in Calexico today. But you all know , in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and at HSI, you know it's not just about infrastructure on our border. We also secured resources to support your work , additional personnel and additional bed space. But I must tell you: The President's declaration of a national emergency has made resources available and we're putting them to good use. And I want to take this opportunity specifically to thank Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Cornyn, Congressmen Brady and Crenshaw. Thank you for standing for border security. Thank you for standing with President Donald Trump to end the crisis of illegal immigration. (Applause.) But I am here today to tell you that we've only , we've only begun this fight. We're going to build the wall. We're going to secure our border in new and in renewed ways. We're going to provide you with the resources we need. But you all know that Congress also has to act. The loopholes in our law that are known as catch and release; the loopholes in our law that do not allow us to return unaccompanied minors to their home countries in Central America the way that we can in Mexico; the very nature of the structure of our legal system is being exploited by human traffickers and it's creating suffering on both sides of our border. I mean, make no mistake about it: These vulnerable families in El Salvador and Honduras and Guatemala are being exploited by human traffickers. They take hard cash , American currency , and then take them on the long and dangerous journey north, exploiting them physically along the way. You all know the statistics better than me about the condition that, particularly, young women arrive in when they arrive at our border. And so, we stand here today to say: We're with you. We're grateful for you every single day. But we also stand here today, with these members of Congress at our side, to say: It is time for Congress to act. It is time for Congress to come together and close the loopholes and end this crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. (Applause.) You're doing your job. It's time they did theirs. (Applause.) So thank you all for being here today. I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits, but I wanted you know that you not only have the respect of the President of the United States and his Vice President, but, as reflected here in these other officials, I just want to assure you: You have the respect of the American people. The American people are grateful for the work that that ICE does every day. We're grateful for the service of our teams at Homeland Security. We know the work you every day makes our families safer, our communities safer. And so I want to urge you on with confidence of that support and confidence of a grateful nation standing with you and standing beside you. And I also want to urge you on just with a prayer. You know, Congressman Crenshaw made a point in our last meeting. He said, ""You know, it's "" , he's someone who has worn the uniform, been in harm's way , like many of you have as well. And frankly, many of you are every day in your current positions. It's important to remember the risks that you take. You don't dwell on them, your families don't think of them any more than they have to, but we know you take risks. The congressman just said that, ""For people that have ever gone through the door not knowing what's on the other side, I can't fully understand the challenges that you face."" And so while I want you to know that we're going to continue to work to give you the resources and support and the respect that you deserve, we're going to call on the Congress to close the loopholes that are making your job even more challenging every day, I want you to know that you also go with the prayers of the American people and with our prayer. As the Old Book says, that ""His faithfulness will be your shield and your rampart"" as you serve. May it be so that you do not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day; that no harm will ever overtake you, as you make him your refuge. So we pray. So to the men and women of ICE, the men and women of Homeland Security: On behalf of the President of the United States, these great Texas officials, and your Vice President, thank you for your service. We are with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you until we end this crisis of illegal immigration and fix this broken immigration system once and for all. Thank you all very much, and God bless you. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1336100/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-homeland-security-investigation-and-ice-agents&speechType=1	National Security Immigration		Houston, TX	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-homeland-security-investigation-ice-agents/
VSMP54201993	Mike Pence	2019-04-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Rice University's Baker Institute	speech	"Well, thank you all for that warm welcome. I'm so honored to be here with all of you who are every day ""educating and engaging the next generation of leaders"" here at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Thank you for being with us today. And it's a particular honor to be here with the man himself, Secretary James A. Baker and his wonderful wife, Susan. Would you join me in thanking them for their countless contributions to the life of this nation? (Applause.) I'm also grateful to be joined by another great champion of freedom and a great friend of mine for many years. He's the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and he has particularly provided leadership and tenacity on the issue of freedom in this hemisphere. Join me in thanking Congressman Michael McCaul for his great leadership for Texas and for America. (Applause.) And it's especially meaningful for me to be here today with so many proud sons and daughters of Venezuela, and also with a man who was imprisoned twice by the enemies of freedom in that country; who was forced into exile; and who, despite all that he has faced, is still working tirelessly to restore democracy and freedom in his homeland: Ambassador for a free Venezuela, Ambassador Carlos Vecchio. Thank you for being with us today. (Applause.) It truly is an honor to be before you today. And when I think of the long history of contributions of Secretary James A. Baker to the life of this nation and to America's place in the world, it seemed altogether fitting to me to come here today to give voice to America's continued determination to advance the cause of liberty in this hemisphere. Mr. Secretary, I thank you for the warm welcome and the hospitality. And allow me to bring to him, to all of our honored guests who are here today, greetings from another friend of mine and a great champion of liberty for the people of Venezuela and all across this hemisphere of freedom. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President asked me to be here today to show our unwavering commitment to a free Venezuela. For far too long, the people of Venezuela have suffered under the heavy hand of oppression. But now there's hope. Hope is springing forth every day in Venezuela. Across that country, in the largest cities and in the smallest towns, people are rising up in defense of their fundamental rights. And as President Trump said not long ago, ""the fight for freedom [in Venezuela] has begun."" (Applause.) We gather at a historic time. The United States is proud to stand with the Venezuelan people. I believe the day is coming when Venezuela will be free once more and when the Venezuelan people will reclaim their democracy and they will reclaim their birthright of libertad. (Applause.) Make no mistake about it: The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, but freedom has the momentum. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolás Maduro must go. (Applause.) At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate President of Venezuela. (Applause.) And now, I'm proud to say, thanks to the President's leadership, more than 50 nations have joined us in common cause. As I've told President Guaidó when we met in Colombia in February, he and his duly-elected government and the National Assembly have our full support because the American people support the Constitution of Venezuela, we support the rule of law, and we recognize that Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship is destroying that once great and prosperous nation. When the dictator came to power, six long years ago, he promised to deliver socialism. And sadly for the people of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro did just that. As we gather here, Venezuela's socialism has shrunk their economy by nearly half. More than 9 out of 10 people live in poverty, and the average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition. As I just heard from families a few short moments ago, thousands of Venezuelan children are starving at this very hour, and thousands of babies in hospitals across Venezuela are dying due to lack of basic medical care and treatment. This rising desperation has fueled a mass exodus, the likes of which we've never seen in this hemisphere. More than 3 million Venezuelans have now abandoned their beloved country. And if things don't get better, it's estimated that another 2 million are expected to follow them out of the country before the year is over. But for those who stay behind, it is a society of lawlessness, corruption, crime, and violence. Thieves in Venezuela don't target banks; they target restaurants because of the lack of food. Vicious gangs and colectivos have turned the streets into literal warzones in many communities across the land. Venezuela now has the highest murder rate in the world, and more than 70 people are slaughtered every single day. You know, my wife and I traveled to the region not long ago. We saw firsthand the hardship facing families who've fled the collapse of Venezuela. I'll never forget the grandmother Karen and I met at a relief shelter in Colombia. It was Cartagena. She told me that it had gotten so bad in their small town that her grandchildren had to rise at four in the morning to get a ticket to buy a piece of bread at four in the afternoon. She said she'd had enough. And so she gathered up her four grandchildren and made the long trek across the country to flee to Colombia. Then there was when we met with families at a Catholic Church in Manaus, Brazil. And, again, our hearts broke when we heard the real stories of what's happening to the people of Venezuela. I heard them again today from families who gather with us. But that day, I remember walking up to a father with two little boys standing beside him. And as the little boys were looking up at me with those soulful eyes, he told me how hard it was the many times that he had to come home and say to those little children, ""We're not going to eat today."" And when he said it, the two little boys nodded, affirming to me that they'd lived what he'd just described. It is utterly unconscionable that Nicolás Maduro has blocked hundreds of tons of food and aid from reaching the impoverished people of Venezuela. Last month, as the world watched, the dictator in Caracas literally danced while truckloads of aid and food and medicine burned and while innocent civilians were cut down by gunfire. For the suffering he has brought to the people of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro must go. (Applause.) And I want to assure all of you: Venezuela's plight has not just captured the attention of the President of the United States and people across the country, but it has stirred the United States of America to act. Since the first days of this administration, America recognized the threat that Nicolás Maduro poses to the Venezuelan people and to nations across the region, including ours. Venezuela is a failed state. Failed states know no boundaries. Narco-trafficking, terrorists, criminal syndicates that emanate from a collapsing society in Venezuela endanger nations throughout our hemisphere, including ours. And I want to assure you: Our administration has taken decisive action to stand with people of Venezuela as they seek to reclaim their freedom. It's been my honor to travel to Latin American five times, as Secretary Baker just alluded, to strengthen the coalition of support for a free Venezuela and strengthen the ties that bind freedom-loving people across this hemisphere. Under President Trump's leadership, I'm proud to report the United States has already provided nearly $200 million in aid to support displaced Venezuelans, and we've staged more than 500 metric tons of humanitarian supplies in neighboring countries. (Applause.) The heart and the generosity of the American people has been demonstrated in the efforts that we've shown and the efforts that private charities have flowed to the region. But the truth is, all of that aid that has been positioned outside the country has only reached suffering Venezuelans if they're outside the country. And so, at the President's direction, the United States has also been working to cut off money from Maduro's corrupt regime. We've imposing sanctions on more than 150 government officials and organizations that are loyal to the dictator in Caracas. We've placed sanctions on Minerven , Venezuela's state-owned gold-mining company; and on BANDES, the state-owned bank that operated as a personal slush fund for the dictator and his cronies. And we're considering more sanctions on the financial sector in the days ahead. And since oil is the lifeblood of that corrupt regime, the United States of America sanctioned Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA. And today, we're taking action against a vital source of the Maduro regime's wealth. At the direction of President Donald Trump, the United States of America will sanction 34 vessels owned or operated by PDVSA, as well as 2 additional companies that transport Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba. (Applause.) Venezuela's oil belongs to the Venezuelan people. (Applause.) And those looking on should know, in the midst of all these actions, as President Trump has made clear: All options are on the table. We will not stand idly by while the Venezuelan people suffer under dictatorship and oppression. And Nicolás Maduro would do well not to test the resolve of the United States of America. Now, America will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela, and it remains our hope. Next Wednesday, I'll address the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Venezuela. And the United States will continue to urge nations around the world to reject Maduro's failed regime and stand with the Venezuelan people to bring an end to this humanitarian crisis once and for all. There can be no bystanders in the struggle for Venezuela's freedom, and the United States today calls on every nation in this hemisphere and around the world to recognize Juan Guaidó as the only legitimate President of Venezuela and stand on the side of freedom. (Applause.) Maduro's tyranny must end and it must end soon. But as the Venezuelan people know, their oppressors do not act alone. And under President Trump, the United States has also taken action to stand up to those who have aided and abetted the dictatorship in Venezuela. The truth is, the dictator has lost the support of his people, and he's seen more than a thousand uniformed soldiers reject his leadership and rally to the banner of freedom. And the truth is, the only way he clings to power is with the help that he receives from communist Cuba. I heard as much from the First Lady of Venezuela just last week. Cuba's leaders are the real imperialists in the Western Hemisphere. (Applause.) The truth has to be told. For decades, Cuba has tried to create client states across this region. While normal countries export goods, Cuba exports tyranny and strong-arm tactics. Cuba's influence has driven Venezuela's failure, and the time has come to liberate Venezuela from Cuba. (Applause.) That's just one more reason why President Trump kept his word when he reversed the failed policies of the last administration toward the dictatorship in Havana. In the coming weeks, the United States will be taking even stronger action against Cuba. In this administration, I promise you, it will always be Que Viva Cuba Libre. And so, while the United States will continue to hold accountable those responsible for the corruption and tyranny and suffering in Venezuela, I also want to assure you that America is focused on the future. We look forward to the day when democracy is restored in Venezuela. And even now, the United States is already working hard to prepare plans with our international partners to help the Venezuelan people recover. And I promise you: Once Nicolás Maduro is gone, the United States and freedom-loving countries around the world will be there to help the Venezuelan people rebuild their nation. (Applause.) Last week, we welcomed the First Lady of Venezuela, Fabiana Rosales, to the White House. I said to her then: We know that the Venezuelan people will never be intimidated, and neither will we. She's a remarkable young woman, standing alongside her courageous husband. They both do Venezuela proud, and we are with them. Earlier this week, I met six families whose loved ones are being held hostage by the Maduro regime. Those families told me how their loved ones had been thrown in jail on trumped up charges, as so many others have; how their court hearings had been canceled over a dozen times; how their loved ones were being deprived of food, medicine, and contact with their family like so many other political prisoners across Venezuela. We actually have with us here today some of those same families. And I was honored to meet, a few minutes ago, with several brave Venezuelans who fled the Maduro regime and are now here in Houston. Their courage and the sacrifice that their families have faced for their stand for freedom, is an inspiration. So I say to all of the families that are here and all those that are looking on, on President Trump's behalf: Estamos con ustedes. (Applause.) We are with you. As President Trump has said, we truly believe ""a new day is coming in Latin America in Venezuela and across the Western Hemisphere. Socialism is dying and liberty, prosperity, and democracy are being reborn."" And as President Trump assured, there is no turning back. We're gathered here today to stand for freedom. And it's my great honor to stand in an institute and alongside a man who has served the cause of freedom with such great distinction. And this great institute will continue that tradition for generations to come. Like Secretary James A. Baker and the Presidents he served, the President that I serve and I believe that liberty is the birthright of all humanity. But as we continue to stand and speak for freedom across this hemisphere, let's also remember to speak about the need to ensure the vitality of freedom here at home. In America, we believe in freedom , where every man and woman can live their lives according to the dictates of their conscience without fear or intimidation. As George Washington wrote in his famous letter to the Hebrew Congregations in Newport, Rhode Island , and I quote , ""the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, [and] requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens."" And it goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. So as we gather here at Rice University , one of the great institutions of higher learning in America , we do well to focus on freedom , freedom across this hemisphere and our own. Because the truth is, we're living in a time in this country of growing support for socialism and a growing intolerance for diverse viewpoints, including on many college campuses across America. Speech codes, safe zones, and intolerance against people whose faith and economic philosophy are no longer considered fashionable are on the rise. And so, as we reflect on the cause of freedom in this hemisphere, let me close with a word to the rising generation , those of you who feel drawn to the siren song of socialism: Be careful what you wish for. Socialism is not the road to freedom. Socialism is the road to government control. And it grows in the soil of censorship. The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protest. And we cherish that right. But once you say that some people should not be heard, once you say some should not be able to think or speak or believe in a certain way in the public square, you have left the road to freedom and you're on the road to serfdom. The people of this country know it doesn't take courage to silence free speech; it takes courage to defend it. (Applause.) My late father was a combat veteran who served in the Korean War. And he used to put it a little more plainly. Dad used to say, ""I may disagree with everything you say, but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it."" (Applause.) The essence of freedom, enshrined in our founding documents and enshrined in the heart of the American people, is the freedom to disagree, the freedom to air one's opinions without fear or intimidation. That , as the Old Book says, that every man and woman shall sit under their own vine tree and under their own fig tree and ""none shall make them afraid."" As President Trump said in his State of the Union Address, ""America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, [or] control."" (Applause.) And so I say to this rising generation: The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. And for the sake of freedom, we must say, as the President said in his State of the Union Address, with one voice, ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) So thank you all for being here today. It's a great honor to be able to address you. You know, freedom springs from the hearts of people around the world, but it has always sprung from the hearts of people here in the New World. I believe freedom will continue to ring across this land and across this hemisphere of freedom. And I believe with all my heart that Venezuela will one day be free. For, in the words of Simón Bolivar, ""A people that loves freedom will, in the end, be free."" (Applause.) So to all the sons and daughters of Venezuela who are with us today, on behalf of all my fellow Americans, I say, ""We're with you."" And we will continue to stand with you until freedom is restored. Know that you go with the support of the American people and with freedom-loving people all over the world. And I believe with all my heart that you also go with the author of freedom, who tells us, ""Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today."" ""For where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" That means freedom always wins. (Applause.) So, with faith in that great promise , faith in all of us joined in this hemisphere of freedom, faith in the courage and strength of the Venezuelan people, the generosity and ideals of the American people , I believe with all my heart: The day is coming soon when Venezuela will once more be free and when her people will see a ""new birth of freedom"" in a nation reborn to libertad. (Applause.) So God bless you. God bless the good people of Venezuela. And God bless America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1336083/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-rice-universitys-baker-institute&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		Houston, TX	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-rice-universitys-baker-institute/
VSMP54201994	Mike Pence	2019-04-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Vice Presidential Film Premiere hosted by the George H.W. Bush Presidential ...	speech	"Well, thank you, Anne Compton, and thank you all for that very, very warm welcome. It is a privilege to be here tonight. To Vice President Cheney, to Vice President Quayle, to Congressman Flores, to Doro Bush Koch and the Bush family, it is our honor to join you here at our very first visit to the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, here on the campus of Texas A&M University. Thanks for making us so welcome. (Applause.) And it's a special joy to be here today with a Marine Corps mom, a champion for military families, and my wife of 33 years. Would you all join me in welcoming, once again, the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence? (Applause.) I know you all are in for a very special evening. And I'm honored to be a part, as festivities begin today. You know, six months ago, when I was approached by a very talented and creative filmmaker, he told me he was doing a documentary about the Office of the Vice President and he thought I might have something to contribute. (Laughter.) And I was, frankly, humbled by that. And I was grateful for the opportunity. And having seen just a small sampling of his artistry and his previous work, I know this is going to be a very special, special documentary about the institution of the vice presidency and all 48 of us who have had the privilege to serve in it. So, would you join me in thanking and congratulating Jeffrey Roth for his remarkable contribution to the life of the nation? (Applause.) You know, it's the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to President Donald Trump. When he asked me to be his running mate, I asked him about the job description. I was governor of Indiana at the time and I knew I was in a position, back in the Hoosier State, to be able to make a difference on issues that were important to the people of my state. And so we sat and we talked about it. And he , he told me at the time , our very first conversation , that he was looking for a Vice President who would be ""active."" And let me tell you: President Trump kept that promise. (Laughter.) Whether it be in advancing his agenda on Capitol Hill or across the country, or carrying our America First agenda across this hemisphere or the wider world, President Donald Trump has kept his promises to me, and he's kept the promises he made to the American people to make American great again. (Applause.) I couldn't be more proud to be a small part of an administration that's making our military stronger, our economy more vibrant, seen a record number of conservatives appointed to our federal courts at every level. And under President Trump's leadership, as in times past, America is once again embracing our role as leader of the free world. And America is leading for freedom on the world stage once again. (Applause.) And I know I speak for all my predecessors gathered here when I say that I'm grateful for the interest in this project and the interest shown in the Office of the Vice President. As my predecessors can attest, we don't get a lot of attention. Truthfully, when the country was founded, the vice presidency went to the runner-up in the Electoral College. In fact, in my office in the White House, I have historic portraits of four former Vice Presidents , including George Washington's Vice President, John Adams, and John Adams's Vice President, Thomas Jefferson. You know, a casual study of history informs us of the tension that that caused in the Adams's administration. But I often remind people that if things hadn't changed, there would be a lot more tension in this administration. (Laughter.) Enough said. (Laughter.) You know, I also have historic portraits of Calvin Coolidge and Teddy Roosevelt. I'm told that a guest at a dinner party reportedly bet that a friend that she could get Calvin Coolidge to say more than two words at the dinner. And he reportedly looked her in the eye and said, ""You lose."" (Laughter.) And Teddy Roosevelt was once described by a contemporary as ""pure energy."" And I guess that must come out of New York City about every hundred years or so. (Laughter.) You know, I'm often asked who I most identify with among my 47 predecessors. And I have to be honest with you, it was a really tough question the first time I got it. Our 44th Vice President, Dan Quayle, is not only a dear friend and a fellow Hoosier, but I marveled, as people of our state did in my youth, when I saw him bring his , the experiences of a meteoric career in the House and the Senate, the energy of a new generation and conservative leadership in the presidency of George Herbert Walker Bush. The nation is indebted to Vice President Dan Quayle and I will always be grateful for his example and his counsel and his friendship. (Applause.) And our 46th Vice President, Vice President Dick Cheney, likewise brought the weight of his experience as a White House Chief of Staff, as a member of Congress, as a Secretary of Defense, to come alongside the presidency of George W. Bush. Vice President Cheney stood by that President during one of the darkest hours in the history of this nation. And he was, in that moment , and remains to this day , one of the greatest champions of our national security and a strong national defense in American history. Thank you, Vice President Cheney, for your leadership and your example. (Applause.) Thank you for , thank you for demonstrating your appreciation of these two extraordinary Americans who made immeasurable contributions to the United States. So you can see why it was a tough question , because I knew two Vice Presidents personally and I'd worked with them closely over the years. But you know, the more I thought about the question, the more I thought that before any of the three of us ever served in this role, this library's namesake had already set the gold standard for the modern vice presidency. And to be honest with you, I can probably most identify with Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush because he served as a sound counselor and a loyal adviser to an outsider who came to Washington, D.C. to shake things up. They did it then, just like we're doing it now. (Applause.) And while he was known as the ""Quiet Man,"" I think it's impossible to look at all the Reagan administration accomplished without seeing, in the background, the steady hand and the experience of Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush. I'm told Ronald Reagan had a plaque on his desk that said, ""There's no limit to what a man can accomplish in this world if he doesn't care who gets the credit."" So I'm confident that President Reagan wouldn't mind if I acknowledged tonight the extraordinary contributions of Vice President Bush to the life of the nation during that extraordinary time. They accomplished so much in those eight years. They revived the American economy, they rebuilt the military, they too restored American leadership on the world stage, and they won the Cold War without firing a shot. (Applause.) And through it all, George Bush always gave the credit to the President that he served. As he said in his 1988 Republican Convention address, and I quote, ""Ronald Reagan asked for, and received, my candor. He never asked for, but he did receive, my loyalty."" And even now, as I serve an outsider who has rebuilt our military, revived the American economy through tax cuts and regulatory reform, and strengthened our courts and renewed American leadership on the world's stage, I'm truly inspired by Vice President Bush's example: his character, his candor, and his loyalty during his season of service in this role. You know, truthfully, the legacy of George Herbert Walker Bush is a lifetime of service. Those of you who cherish his memory, and those of you who generously contribute to this great institution's efforts to preserve it for future generations know that story. But it's remarkable to think he flew 58 combat missions in World War II, served as a congressman, an ambassador to the U.N., an envoy to China, a CIA Director, and went on to serve as Vice President and President of the United States. But as I suspect this documentary will attest when it speaks of his time of service as Vice President, he also left America, during that season of his service, and the world, more peaceful, prosperous, and secure. And in every office he held, he showed a character and a humility that did his family proud and did our nation proud. You know, four months ago, as our nation bid farewell to our 41st President, it was my great honor to speak at the state ceremony in the United States Capitol Rotunda. It was a deeply humbling experience. I told of the story of when I first met Vice President Bush in 1988. I was 29 years old, just getting started in politics. But then, as always in any other encounter I ever had with him, I was struck by his approachability. He spoke of mutual friends in Indiana, talked of his many warm memories there. He set me at ease. Dealt with me as a person. And I'll never forget the moment. For all that he'd accomplished in his life, in his family, as a nation, he was warm, he was engaging, he was without pretense. And I tried to speak of that in those words in the Capitol that day. A few weeks after the service, I was humbled to receive a letter from a dear friend of President Bush's, Secretary James A. Baker, and I'll always cherish what he said. Writing favorably and encouragingly about my remarks, he said that I had, quote, in his words, ""described the very essence of this fine man."" He went on to say, ""Yes, he was a great leader and President, and it's rewarding to see history remembering him as just that."" But he said, ""Mike, you were spot on when you observed that there was much more to him,"" that ""There was a kindness about [him] that was evident to everyone who ever met him."" That ""his years in public service were characterized by kindness [and] modesty and patriotism."" This nation owes an extraordinary debt for the life and service of Vice President and President George Herbert Walker Bush. And I owe him a debt as well for his kindness and inspiration and his example. So thank you again for the honor of addressing you here tonight. And it's hard to describe sometimes how deeply humbling it is for a small-town boy from southern Indiana to be serving as Vice President of the United States. To be serving , to be serving at such a time as this in the life of our nation. And it's also humbling to be in the company of two of our nation's most accomplished Vice Presidents, who I know you'll be hearing from, shortly. You know, it's interesting, the first time I ever saw Air Force Two was in Muncie, Indiana, when Vice President Dan Quayle flew in to campaign for me in 1990. Today, when I landed here, my friend was at the base of the stairs. (Laughter.) And the first time I was ever on Air Force Two was when Vice President Dick Cheney took me on a flight to my hometown and landed at a little airport in Columbus, Indiana. I stand here today deeply humbled to be able to serve the nation in this role and to be able to address you. And also to be a part of this effort tonight to begin to think about this institution and the contributions , the often quiet contributions , that Vice Presidents have made throughout our history. And I expect, when my two predecessors speak tonight, you'll leave here today with a better understanding , not only of their time in office, but of the nature of the Vice Presidency. And I know it's going to be a very special time. And it will make a contribution to public understanding of this office and its responsibilities. But let me just take this opportunity just to say thank you. Thank you for the opportunity that me and my family have been given to serve our nation in this role. You know, I've been asked oftentimes what I was thinking about during the moment that I had my right hand in the air, that you just saw in the video. And I remember very vividly, surrounded by my wife and children, reciting that Oath of Office, looking out at a sea of well-wishers that had come to see the Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. And for all the world, I couldn't stop thinking about my grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley. Richard Michael Cawley grew up in a small town in northwest Ireland, called Tubbercurry, in County Sligo. I actually visited his home shortly after he passed away. I saw the two-room house where he and his nine brothers and sisters grew up. And legend has it in our home that my grandfather told him that he had to go to America because there's a future there. And he would be 20 years before he ever spoke to his mother again after leaving what he would always call, to his last day, ""the Old Country."" But my grandfather came here. He landed on Ellis Island. He went to Chicago. He drove a bus for 40 years. And as I was up on that platform, I couldn't help but think about what Richard Michael Cawley was thinking looking down from glory, to see his namesake, Michael Richard Pence, taking the Oath of Office to be Vice President of the United States. But two thoughts came to mind: Number one, I'm sure he was very surprised. (Laughter.) My grandfather knew me well and we were very close. But more seriously, I really believe with all my heart, looking down from glory, that my grandfather had to be thinking just one thought: That he was right. He was right to come. He was right to believe in America. That it's a place where anybody could be anybody. And the grandson of an Irish immigrant could be raising their right hand to serve as the 48th Vice President of the United States. It's a testament not to that grandson, but to a great nation. So thank you for coming out tonight. It is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President at such a time as this. I'm grateful for the example of all of those who have gone before. And I'm grateful for the support and the prayers of all of you who continue to hold up the ideals that have always made this country great and are making America great again. Thank you very much. God bless you. And have a great evening. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1336078/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-vice-presidential-film-premiere-hosted-by-the-george-hw-bush-presidential-library-foundation&speechType=1	Arts, Entertainment, and History		College Station, TX	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-vice-presidential-film-premiere-hosted-george-h-w-bush-presidential-library-foundation/
VSMP104201992	Mike Pence	2019-04-10	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Special Session of the United Nations Security Council on the Crisis in Venez ...	speech	"Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, to all the members of the Security Council: I am here today, on behalf of the President of the United States of America, to discuss the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and to call on this body to stand up for democracy and the rule of law in that nation that has suffered so much. Article 24 of the U.N. Charter confers on this Security Council the ""responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security."" As another American President said many years ago, ""The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members."" It is why this institution exists. For six long years, the people of Venezuela have suffered under the heavy hand of oppression. The Maduro regime's socialist policies have shrunk their economy by nearly half. In what was once one of the wealthiest countries in our hemisphere, 9 out of 10 people now live in poverty. The average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition. Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving. And at this very hour, infants in hospitals across Venezuela are dying for lack of basic medical care. And the Maduro regime, in the midst of this deprivation and suffering, has used violence and intimidation against anyone who opposes their actions. In the last three months, the regime has thrown at least 1,255 people into jail, without any due process of law, and killed at least 40 protestors. That's the nature of the regime that we're dealing with. But the Maduro regime is not only a threat to the Venezuelan people; it is a threat to peace and security of the wider region as well. The rising desperation in Venezuela has fueled a mass exodus, the likes of which we have never seen in the Western Hemisphere. More than 3 million Venezuelans have now abandoned their beloved country. And if things don't get better, it is estimated that another 2 million are expected to follow before the year is out. And traveling through the region, my wife and I witnessed the results of this deprivation firsthand. At a church in Manaus, Brazil, we spoke to families who had fled the deprivation in Venezuela. And I'll never forget when a father looked at me with his two young boys standing at his side and said how hard it was as a father to come home at the end of the day and say, ""We're not eating today."" And as he said it, his two little boys looked up and nodded, recalling those days. And then there was the day in Cartagena, Colombia, at another mission where Venezuelan people had fled the deprivation in their country. And a grandmother told me how it had gotten so bad in their small rural town, her grandchildren had had to rise at four in the morning to get a single ticket to purchase a piece of bread at four in the afternoon. The children were starving. And she gathered up her grandchildren and fled the country. Those are the stories the world deserves to hear of deprivation. And the truth is, those who stay behind are subject to crime, violence, and lawlessness. Thieves in Venezuela don't rob banks; they rob restaurants for food. Vicious gangs and so-called colectivos have turned the streets into warzones. And Venezuela now has the highest murder rate in the world, as more than 70 people are murdered every single day. Venezuela is a failed state, and as history teaches, failed states know no boundaries. Drug traffickers, criminal gangs, even terrorists like Hezbollah, are exploiting the chaos in Venezuela to gain a foothold in the region and export crime and violence. Were we to let the crisis continue, the chaos and suffering will only spread. The struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolás Maduro must go. But for all of the suffering of the Venezuelan people, across Venezuela, in cities large and small, people are rising up. They're rising up against their oppression and deprivation. Today, those courageous Venezuelans will take to the streets again. And as President Trump said not long ago, ""the fight for freedom [in Venezuela] has [just] begun."" Just three short months ago, after Nicolás Maduro was sworn into his second term stolen in a sham election, the National Assembly , the only duly elected body in Venezuela , exercised its power under the constitution and recognized a new leader: Interim President Juan Guaidó. And all across the Western Hemisphere, nations have been standing up to declare their support for President Guaidó. Last month, the Inter-American Development Bank voted to seat President Guaidó's representative. Earlier this week, the G7 issued a statement saying the May 2018 presidential election lacked legitimacy and calling on the Maduro regime to, in their words, ""restore the authority of the National Assembly."" And just yesterday, the Organization of American States , the oldest regional organization in the world , voted to stand with the Venezuelan people and recognize the Guaidó government's representative as the only true representative of Venezuela. At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first nation to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela. And today, 54 nations have joined us. The Western Hemisphere has spoken with a clear voice. Nations across the world have spoken. It's time for the United Nations to speak. In February, the United States introduced a resolution to this Security Council that called for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela and for the Maduro regime to allow all humanitarian aid to enter the country. The resolution was not approved. Two nations which continue to back this brutal regime used their vetoes to stop this body from taking action. And while Russia and China continue to obstruct the Security Council, rogue states like Iran and Cuba are doing all they can to prop up the Maduro regime. For decades, Cuba has tried to create client states across our region. While normal countries export goods, Cuba exports tyranny and strong-arm tactics. Even now, Cuban military and intelligence services train and support and equip Venezuela's secret police as they silence opponents, jail and torture members of the opposition. Last week, the United States took action to sanction ships transporting Venezuelan oil to Cuba. And soon, at President Trump's direction, the United States will announce additional action to hold Cuba accountable for its malign influence in Venezuela. And this week, in addition to Cuba's action, Caracas received a delegation from Iran to begin direct air service between these two rogue capitals. This blacklisted airline is used to export terrorism by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which President Trump formally designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on Monday. This is the company that Nicolás Maduro keeps. And these nations continue to prop him up even as he inflicts suffering on the Venezuelan people. Just two months ago, the dictator in Caracas actually danced while his own citizens were shot and truckloads of desperately needed food and medicine burned. Unlike nations that are subsidizing the dictator in Caracas, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States has been standing with the people of Venezuela, and we are committed to helping the families and communities that have been devastated by the Maduro regime. At this point, the United States has sanctioned more than 150 government officials and organizations loyal to the dictator. We've sanctioned state-owned businesses to prevent the Maduro regime from robbing the people of what is rightfully theirs. And as President Trump has said, we can be ""a lot tougher."" In addition, the United States has positioned more than 500 metric tons of food and humanitarian supplies on the Venezuelan border ready for immediate distribution. We've provided $200 million in aid to support displaced Venezuelans and the host communities that support them. And today, at President Trump's direction, the United States is announcing an additional $60 million in humanitarian assistance to address this crisis. The United States of America will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela. But all options are on the table. Up to this point, while other international bodies have acted, the United Nations and this Security Council have refused to act. But now that nations across this hemisphere have spoken, the time has come for the United Nations to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela and seat his representative in this body. This body should revoke the credentials of Venezuela's representative to the United Nations, recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó, and seat the representative of the free Venezuelan government in this body without delay. With all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, you shouldn't be here. You should return to Venezuela and tell Nicolás Maduro that his time is up. It's time for him to go. Members of this Security Council: The men, women, and children in Venezuela are suffering. Their economy has been destroyed. Their democracy has been destroyed. The people of Venezuela are paying the price. And soon, the region and the world will pay the price if we fail to act. There can be no bystanders to this history. For the peace and security of our hemisphere, the world and the United Nations must stand with the people of Venezuela. To that end, the United States is preparing a resolution recognizing the legitimacy of the government of Interim President Juan Guaidó. And today, we urge every member of the Security Council and all U.N. member states to support this resolution. Stand with the Venezuela people as they rise up to restore freedom, democracy, and libertad to their nation. And this they are doing; they are rising up against intimidation and violence. Even today, the people of Venezuela are taking to the streets to march for freedom. Despite all the hardship, they continue to march. Despite all of the oppression, they continue to march. Despite the opposition, they continue to march with courage and strength because they're marching for freedom. And in the words of Simón Bolivar, ""A people that loves freedom will in the end be free."" But it's time for the United Nations to act and for the world to stand with the people of Venezuela as they march to freedom. History has taught us what happens when the civilized nations of the world allow oppression to go unchecked. When a brutal dictatorship arose in Europe, the world failed to respond. Millions of lives were lost in the Second World War. This very institution was forged in the aftermath of that war so that nations around the world could come together and confront dictatorship with one voice. And so the United States is calling on the United Nations to live up to its very purpose: Reject the failed leadership of Nicolás Maduro, and stand with us, stand with nations across the world and across this hemisphere to help the people of Venezuela forge a brighter future. As President Trump has said, quote, ""If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength."" So let us today rededicate ourselves to the mission upon which this body was founded: to maintain international peace and security. And we have confidence that if we do that, if we make every effort to be at peace, that the God of peace will guide us and bless us, today, tomorrow, and always. So thank you, Mr. President, for the honor of addressing you today. May God bless the people of Venezuela. And may God bless you all."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1336101/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-a-special-session-of-the-united-nations-security-council-on-the-crisis-in-venezuela&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		New York, NY	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-special-session-united-nations-security-council-crisis-venezuela-new-york-ny/
VSMP184201917	Mike Pence	2019-04-18	Statement from Vice President Mike Pence	statement	Today's release of the Special Counsel's report confirms what the President and I have said since day one: there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and there was no obstruction of justice. After two years of investigation, conducted with the full cooperation of this Administration, that involved hundreds of witness interviews and millions of pages of documents, the American people can see for themselves: no collusion, no obstruction. Now that the Special Counsel investigation is completed, the American people have a right to know whether the initial investigation was in keeping with long-standing Justice Department standards , or even lawful at all. We must never allow our justice system to be exploited in pursuit of a political agenda. While many Democrats will cling to discredited allegations, the American people can be confident President Trump and I will continue to focus where we always have, on advancing an agenda that's making our nation stronger, safer, and more secure.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1337338/statement-from-vice-president-mike-pence&speechType=6	Government Operations		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-vice-president-mike-pence-4/
VSMP244201991	Mike Pence	2019-04-24	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Auto Industry Discussion of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement	speech	"Well, hello, Michigan! (Applause.) It is great to be with you all here at Motor City Solutions. Because of all of you and the people that you represent all across this great state, Michigan is back, America is back, and Motor City is the car capital of the world. Congratulations. (Applause.) It's true. It's really true. It really is an honor for me to be with all the leaders of the automotive industry here in Michigan. In fact, I just visited the Ford truck plant in Dearborn, and I got to tell you: America's autoworkers are the best people in the world. (Applause.) I was so impressed. And I'm also honored to be joined not only by industry leaders and by all of you who represent suppliers and manufacturers across the automotive industry, but I'm honored to be joined by some great champions in the Congress of the United States , legislative leaders who have been partners with President Trump and I as we've championed this growing economy. Join me in thanking Congressman John Moolenaar and Congressman Paul Mitchell. Where are you guys? (Applause.) Right in front of me. Thank you. Stand up. Thank you. I'm also honored to be joined today by the Deputy Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. I'm especially proud , got her start in transportation when she was working for the state of Indiana. Join me in welcoming Brandye Hendrickson, from Washington, D.C. She's doing a great job. (Applause.) Thanks, Brandye. And most of all, to Bill Long, to Sandy Baruah, and to all the workers and job creators who make this country run: It's an honor to join you here in the great state of Michigan, in the heart of the heartland, to have the opportunity to address the men and women of America's auto suppliers at such an important time in the life of this industry and the life of this nation. And I got to tell you: I'm excited to be here in Michigan, but when I was talking to a friend of mine on the phone this morning, and I told him I was headed here to Michigan, I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. He's on the road himself today, but allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a man who loves American cars, who loves the state of Michigan, and who is grateful every day for the state that turned the blue wall red in 2016. I bring greetings from President Donald Trump to each and every one of you. (Applause.) Now, two years ago, President Trump spoke for our entire administration and for millions of Americans when he went to the Motor City and he told the world, in his words, ""There is no more beautiful sight than an American-made car."" Since the earliest days of our administration, President Trump has promised to ""fight for your jobs"" and to ""fight for Michigan workers,"" and to fight to keep making cars right here in America. And two years later, I'm proud to report, President Donald Trump delivered for the people of Michigan and the people of America. (Applause.) It's true. In just over two years' time, we signed laws cutting federal red tape at a historic rate. We unleashed American energy as never before. We've been fighting for more fair and reciprocal trade deals around the world. And this President signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. And the results have been remarkable. In just a little more than two years, businesses large and small across America have created 5.5 million new jobs, including nearly 100,000 jobs right here in the state of Michigan. (Applause.) It's amazing to think, after the last administration saw America lose 210,000 manufacturing jobs, the last President actually memorably said, back in 2016, that we weren't going to be able to bring manufacturing jobs back. Remember that? Remember that famous question: ""What magic wand do you have?"" Well, we didn't need a ""magic wand."" We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. (Applause.) It's true. It's true. And since President Trump's election, we've actually seen 480,000 manufacturing jobs created all across America, including more than 26,000 here in the state of Michigan. Manufacturing is roaring back. (Applause.) And thanks to the investment and the ingenuity represented so well here at this forum, America has actually seen businesses in the auto industry create 110,000 new jobs over the last two years alone. In fact, I'm told 2018 was not only the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years, it's actually the highest level of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. You know, I come from the Hoosier State, before I got my present work. And I always said, ""In this part of the country we do two things well: We make things and we grow things."" And thanks to the leadership of this President and the support that we've had in the Congress of the United States, American manufacturing is back and the auto industry is leading the way. (Applause.) And just to be clear, it's not just manufacturing. The headline this morning attested to the fact: Yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time record, boosting retirement 401(k)s for tens of millions of Americans. And under this administration, I'm proud to report, the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low, with the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is coming back for every American. (Applause.) And the truth is, wages are also rising all across the board. Wages are rising at the fastest pace they have in a decade, and they're rising most rapidly for working Americans, like the people I just spent time with down in Dearborn. As the President said this morning, in his words, the stock market and the economy are doing the best they've ever done. A hundred and sixty million Americans are going to work every day. In fact, there are more Americans working today than ever before in our nation's history. Our economy is roaring. Our nation is prospering. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. It's happening. (Applause.) It's happening. But for everything we've accomplished in the last two years, it really is a testament to all of you. The policies that this President has advanced, with the strong support of our partners in the Congress of the United States, have created the conditions that you , and the companies and the workers that you represent , have been able to take advantage of and build and prosper and create jobs. The job creators, the small-business owners represented here. The hardworking Americans on the assembly line. So, first and foremost, let me begin today by saying what I said at that plant just a couple of hours ago. And that is just ""thank you."" Thank you for stepping forward. Thank you for leading. Thank you for bringing opportunity back for Americans. It's truly inspiring to see. But I'm also here today to ask for your help. In his Detroit speech just two years ago, our President pledged to pursue, in his words, ""a new future of American automotive leadership."" And that's just what we've been doing. He promised that this, again, would be expanding and growing as ""the car capital of the world."" And with all of your support, it's happening. But to keep the momentum that we see happening in this industry and in the American economy rolling, the President and I know that we've got to level the playing field for American autoworkers by forging trade deals that put America first. And that's just exactly what we've been doing. You see, this is a President who understands that when a nation builds, it grows. That all honest work is honorable. And since the days of Henry Ford, the autoworker and auto industry have been the backbone of American manufacturing. And the automotive industry is the backbone of American manufacturing today. (Applause.) Automakers, suppliers, workers, dealerships, local businesses that support them actually employ, I'm told, more than 7.2 million Americans who come to work every day with good-paying jobs. It's actually more than any other manufacturing sector in the country. You're also our nation's largest exporter, selling $692 billion in vehicles and parts all across the world every single year. That's nearly $50 billion more than our next largest exporter in this economy. And you're making historic investments, I'm pleased to report, in America's workers, keeping our competitive edge well into the 21st century. In the past five years alone, automakers have announced almost $60 billion in capital investments in this country, everything from engine and transmission plants, to research and development labs, to corporate headquarters. You make the cars, the trucks, the auto parts that make America run. You're investing in America, and America is growing as a result. And we thank you for that. (Applause.) You're making our country stronger, more prosperous. And, being more prosperous, you're making America more secure. But for all we've accomplished in these last two years, this President looks , he never looks in the rearview mirror, I can promise you that. It's always out the windshield. He just looks at all of it and says it's a good start. Frankly, after decades of seeing jobs and investment pouring overseas, President Trump made it a priority to make sure that companies continue to invest and have incentives to invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America. But we've got to work together to promote and protect what the President calls those four beautiful words: ""Made in the USA."" That's why, since early in this administration, President Trump and our team have been working to forge trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. From Europe to the Indo-Pacific, we've been fighting unfair trade practices. We've been negotiating deals that promote free, fair, and reciprocal trade. But the time has come for the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. The time has come for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. (Applause.) That's why I'm here. That's why I'm here, and it's why I'm going to be traveling all across the country talking about the USMCA and the difference that it's going to make in our economy , and not only in the automotive industry, but in manufacturing and industries across the spectrum. The USMCA will actually impact more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs that depend on exports to Canada and Mexico. It's absolutely essential because the USMCA will finally give workers the level playing field and be able to compete and win on a global stage as never before. I mean, think about it: Under NAFTA, which was written more than a quarter of a century ago, before Bluetooth, before Sirius radio, before advanced batteries, computerized navigation systems, or any of the major innovations that we take for granted today, NAFTA would , actually, it doesn't require that any of these auto parts to be made in North America, let alone in the United States. It simply doesn't mention them. And as some of you who understand the NAFTA agreement know, that means that, if they're not mentioned in the agreement, they're deemed as having been manufactured here. That means today, through American , though American cars face all kinds of tariffs and trade barriers all around the world, companies can buy auto parts from China, assemble them in a car in Mexico, and sell them in the United States, duty free. The truth is, that puts American companies and their suppliers at a disadvantage. And it's one more reason why, unfortunately, 8 of the last 11 auto plants in North America were built in Mexico instead of the United States of America. But, men and women, I'm here to say: Those days are over. The USMCA will level the playing field and treat the automotive industry right and fair, and it's going to be a win for American workers and American jobs. (Applause.) It's true. We're not going to allow an outdated trade deal to undercut American workers and undermine good-paying jobs , the kind of jobs that built our middle class in the past and are building it today. Under the USMCA, the American worker is going to be able to compete on a level playing field and win as never before. You know, just last week, the United States Trade Representative released a study that says if the USMCA goes into effect, we can actually expect automakers to invest an additional $34 billion in our country. They'll actually see auto suppliers sell an additional $23 billion in auto parts, and we're estimating that it will create 76,000 new jobs in the auto sector alone. The International Trade Commission , the U.S. International Trade Commission actually weighed in with a report of its own this week. Maybe some of you have seen it. It actually said the USMCA will add more than $68 billion and 176,000 jobs to our economy. And our manufacturing sector will see the biggest gains of all. But you don't have to take their word for it. Already, the Big Three emanating out of here in Michigan are making historic investments. In fact, earlier this year, here in Michigan, Fiat Chrysler announced it's going to invest $4.5 billion in this great state in a new assembly plant and create 6,500 new jobs. Ford announced it's going to invest $900 million in its manufacturing footprint in Michigan. And just last month, GM announced another $300 million in the Great Lakes State and 400 new jobs. That's investment in Michigan. That's investment in America. And that's going to drive a growing America when we pass the USMCA. (Applause.) But we got to get it done. We got to get it done. And that's really why I'm here to ask for your help. The American Automotive Policy Council said the USMCA is going to create significant growth in the U.S. auto industry. And I can tell from the leaders that are all gathered here that you already know that. But the clock is ticking. It's time. And we need Congress to act to approve the USMCA and to approve the USMCA this year. But Motor City and the great state of Michigan need to be heard. That's why I started here. I'm literally going to be traveling all over the country, talking about the benefits to American jobs and American workers that will come when the USMCA is signed into law. The truth of the matter is, we need to hear from Michigan. We need to hear from Motor City. We need to hear from the backbone of American manufacturing when we make this story. So I want to encourage each and every one of you , all the leaders gathered here and all of you that are looking on: Go out and tell the story. Tell people how this agreement is going to level the playing field for American workers. Tell them how this agreement is going to lead to more jobs and more investment right here in the USA. Tell them why we need the USMCA so ""Made in the USA"" is rallying and leading the world once again. (Applause.) But the truth is, we've done our jobs. Under the President's leadership, we negotiated a treal that , a deal that, I promise you, puts American jobs and American workers first. But now it's time for Congress to do their job and pass the USMCA. So I want to thank you all for coming out today. I want to thank you for hearing me out in this cause. And I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can before I slip away back to Washington, D.C. But in the days and the weeks that lie ahead, I want to promise you: We're going to continue to work every day to ensure that our nation's auto industry and manufacturing across this country continues to grow and thrive. But the truth is, when this industry is growing and prospering here across the Heartland of America, America is prospering and America succeeds. And I promise you, President Trump and I are going to keep fighting , keep fighting for all the things that you've supported over the last two years that have revived this American economy, revived manufacturing, and revived this auto industry. But it's going to take all of us in the days ahead. So as I close here, I just , I do want to encourage each one of you to do your part. Keep promoting the kind of policies out of Washington, D.C. that have got this economy rolling again. And get out and tell the story of what we've been able to do , not only on USMCA and the need for Congress to act, but I hope, in the days ahead, that you'll get out, you'll talk to people about the progress we've made as a country. I mean, talk to your coworkers, talk to your employees, talk to your suppliers and your vendors about the larger issues today. Talk to them about how we've been able to roll back red tape, cut taxes in ways, and negotiated new, free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that are creating jobs and opportunities for Americans. Tell them how we've rolled back the heavy hand of government, and American companies just like yours are now able to invest and innovate and create jobs and opportunities here in Michigan and all across this country. I mean, tell them how you're investing in the American people. And tell them how we're committed to workforce development, innovative education, and job training. Tell them how we're putting Washington, D.C. back to work for them, and not the other way around. Because it's absolutely true. You're the leaders of an industry that is so vital and so closely identified with the American Dream, now well more than a century , dreams that have been happening in the greater Motor City area and in Michigan. And I just had to come here today and encourage you to, once again, let your voice be heard. We need Michigan to lead. We need the auto industry to lead. We need you to let Congress know that it's time to step forward. It's time to step forward and deliver for the American people. Because the truth of the matter is, as I said before , I'll close with this: As the American automotive industry prospers, America prospers. And with the USMCA ratified and agreed to between the United States and Canada and Mexico, I promise you: The best is yet to come for the automotive industry in Michigan and in America. We're going to make this country more prosperous than ever before. Together, we're going to make it safer than ever before. And with President Trump in the White House, with this agreement approved, with the support and the leaders here in Michigan and in the Congress of the United States, and with God's help, I know, in my heart of hearts, we will make America great again. Thank you all very much. God bless you. Now let's get out there and get the USMCA done. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1339022/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-auto-industry-discussion-of-the-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement&speechType=1	Business and Consumers		Taylor, MI	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-auto-industry-discussion-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-taylor-michigan/
VSMP304201990	Mike Pence	2019-04-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Crew Members of the USS Harry S. Truman	speech	"Thank you, Vice Admiral Lewis, for that kind introduction and those inspiring words. And thank you, sailors. At ease. You may be seated. To Captain Dienna, Captain Snowden, Command Master Chief Carter, to the extraordinary men and women who serve on this ship: It is my great honor to join you aboard America's Lone Warrior, the USS Harry S. Truman, where for more than 20 years you've been ""giving 'em hell"" on every deployment. (Applause.) And it's especially great to return to the Truman. You know, I first set foot on this great ship just over 16 years ago, when my wife and I had the privilege of visiting with courageous sailors of this ship when it was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. We arrived on a COD aircraft. I walked on today. (Laughter.) I preferred coming here on the COD, if you're taking notes. So thanks again for the warm welcome back. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great supporter of all of the men and women who wear the uniform of our armed forces. I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It really is an honor to stand before all of you here at the largest naval base in the world, to stand before men and women who stepped forward to serve in our all-volunteer Navy, to serve in a cause greater than yourselves, and to consider others' lives more important than your own. It is the noble calling, and you've answered the call in the cause of freedom, and you have the respect and gratitude of the American people. As we gather here today to honor what all of you do in the defense of freedom, I know our hearts and the hearts of the American people are elsewhere in this hemisphere, as well with the people of Venezuela as they take to the streets at this very hour in Operation Libertad. As we stand here today aboard this ship, the people of Venezuela are seeking to reclaim freedom and democracy in their nation , a nation impoverished by dictatorship, socialism, and oppression. And so we say to President Juan Guaidó, to all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela: Estamos con ustedes , we are with you. And America will stand with you in this hemisphere of freedom until your democracy is restored. (Applause.) And to the freedom-loving people of Venezuela, we say: As you stand for freedom, we stand with you. Vayan con Dios , go with God. It is an honor to be with all of you today. The United States Navy is the greatest force for good the Seven Seas have ever known. (Applause.) And President Trump asked me to be here today to pay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honor to each of you who have answered the call to serve and stand in defense of this nation, above and below these decks every day. As President Trump said in our first year in office, in his words, ""American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world [and] our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas."" (Applause.) You know, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and who fights every day on behalf of those who fight for us. You know, after the last administration depleted our military through constant budget cuts, I'm pleased to report to all of you gathered here that President Trump has taken decisive action to rebuild our military, and we are restoring the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) Last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and called for the building of 350 ship Navy. And we are on our way. (Applause.) In fact, just a few months ago, your Commander-in-Chief proposed the largest defense budget in American history , some $750 billion , to ensure that the strongest fighting force in the history of the world is stronger still. And the President's budget for shipbuilding is the largest shipbuilding request in more than 20 years. (Applause.) The President's budget request would give the United States Navy the resources to buy 12 new battle force ships. We'll fund 55 ships over the Future Years Defense Program, and we'll bring the United States Navy to 355 battle force ships by 2034. (Applause.) And I'm pleased to report the President's budget has given the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States not only the respect that you deserve every day, but the resources. This President signed the largest pay increase for men and women of our armed forces in more than 10 years. (Applause.) And you deserve every single penny. And you can know with confidence that, under President Trump's leadership, we will always give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support you need to accomplish your mission and come home safe. And our historic investments in our military have already had a critical impact here in the Hampton Roads area. Under President Trump's leadership, Hampton Roads saw three additional vessels homeported here, compared with two years ago. And the largest Navy installation population got even bigger, growing by more than 25,000 families. And while it is very secondary to our national defense, the economic impact of the Navy in this region grew by more than $13 billion. That's more than $600 million of investment in this local economy in Norfolk and in Virginia than just one year ago , promoting prosperity and jobs and support for all of your families. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, I'm also pleased to report to you that that economic growth is not unusual these days, despite what some have been saying lately. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, the American economy is soaring. Over the last two years, businesses large and small have created 5.5 million new jobs, and there are more Americans working today than ever before in American history. This economy is roaring, and America is back. (Applause.) The truth is, the nation that you defend is more prosperous today than ever before. And the peace that you secure is making possible unprecedented growth. And every American is grateful for your service in defense of our freedom, in defense of our nation. You know, it really is an honor to be back aboard the Truman. And looking out at all of you and your shining faces is incredibly inspiring. You all serve this country with great distinction. There's a lot of stories to tell about the people who have served on this ship , past, present, and future , but let me acknowledge a couple of crew members before I leave. Petty Officer Lamont Sewell , where are you? , from Chester, Pennsylvania. Where are you, Lamont? Since joining the United States Navy 18 years ago, Petty Officer Sewell has grown into one of the most skilled aviation support equipment technicians here at Norfolk. He is an incredible sailor. Would you join me in congratulating the Truman's 2018 Sailor of the Year, Petty Officer Lamont Sewell? Great job. (Applause.) We're also joined by another Petty Officer from the Bronx, New York. Throughout her career in the Navy, including her current role as a logistics specialist here aboard the Truman, she's actually consistently upheld the highest levels of professionalism and leadership. And I'm sure it was no surprise to all of you when she was named the Petty Officer of the Year. And let me see if I can , where is Petty Officer Gonzalez at? Let's give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) Great job. Great job. These are just a couple of examples of sailors who have gone above and beyond the call of duty. So I'm grateful that you've joined me in showing your appreciation for their excellence. It's really emblematic what all of you do here each and every day. And the truth is, I have no doubt that these sailors are emblematic of each and every one of you and the service that you provide. But let me also say, as we give credit where credit is due, I know for many of you, you do not serve alone. Mrs. Pence was at Norfolk just a couple of short weeks ago acknowledging the families that are behind our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard. So, how about a big round of applause for the Navy families that are out there , (applause) , and the wonderful spouses and kids that support you each and every day? (Applause.) I know, for so many of you, you couldn't do it , you just couldn't do it without the support of the folks at home, without the spouse, without the encouragement of your kids, without your proud parents. And we remember them today. For more than 20 years, the USS Truman and its crew have played a vital role in defending our nation and protecting our interests across the globe. And it's humbling for me to stand among all of you that have continued that tradition. This ship has served as a constant sign to the world that we will always ensure our security and we will always stand for peace through strength. During each deployment in its prolific career, the USS Truman has taken the fight , taken the fight to the enemy on our terms, on their soil, particularly when it comes to the battle against radical Islamist terrorism. The USS Truman launched over 2,000 sorties throughout the Middle East in the last year alone. And the 7,500 sailors who serve in the Truman's Carrier Strike Group played an essential part in crippling ISIS, bombarding their territory, I'm told with nearly 1,600 precision munitions, the most of any U.S. Strike Group. And now the ISIS caliphate's territory is no more. Job well done, Truman. (Applause.) The Truman has also been there to provide desperately needed relief to Americans suffering in the wake of natural disasters and tragedies, including the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I'm told the crew of this ship delivered meals, clean water, and other vital supplies to those whose lives were torn apart in that devastating storm. And just last year, this ship helped revolutionize naval warfare when it became the first carrier to deploy under Dynamic Force Employment. This new approach will make our Navy ""strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable,"" ensuring that our readiness and long-term reliability never undermine our security. As part of that deployment, the Truman made history and participated in Trident Juncture, the largest NATO military exercise since the fall of the Berlin Wall. It involved some 14,000 American troops, 29 NATO members. And last year, this ship became the first American carrier to operate within the Arctic Circle in more than two decades. Job well done. You showed the U.S. Navy stands ready to defend America's interests anywhere in the world. (Applause.) You know, this history and these achievements are a testament , a testament to your professionalism, the professionalism that each one of you shows every day. It's inspiring to see. It's a testament to your dedication, your leadership, and the remarkable efficiency and command readiness. I'm told, last year, actually, the USS Truman was awarded the ""Battle E,"" which is given to the ship that demonstrates the highest level of performance of any carrier on the East Coast. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) That's just a sign of excellence and commitment that's making our nation safer. I'm here to tell you that President Trump and I are proud of the Truman. In fact, I met with the President at the White House this morning, and I told him I was going to be with all of you here on the deck of the Truman. And I can assure you the President and I understand the importance of the work that you do every day. And I know that I speak on behalf of all the American people when I say that we couldn't be more proud and we couldn't be more grateful for your patriotism and your selflessness. And as I stand before you today, I know that the future of this aircraft carrier is the subject of some budget discussions in Washington, D.C. And as we continue to fight Congress to make sure that our military has the resources you need to accomplish your mission, President Donald Trump asked me to deliver a message to each and every one of you on the deck of the USS Truman: We are keeping the best carrier in the world in the fight. We are not retiring the Truman. (Applause.) The USS Harry S. Truman is going to be ""giving ""em hell"" for many more years to come. (Applause.) You know, the ship you serve aboard bears a proud and noble name. It's a man who distinguished himself as an artillery officer in World War I. He answered the call to public service. He served in the United States Senate, was a Vice President, and then President of the United States of America. But throughout his life, Harry S. Truman was tried and tested, and he always met the challenge , just like all of you. Through adversity, his greatness emerged. And history now records the enormous contributions that President Harry S. Truman made to the life of this nation. You all have been tested, as well, during your service here aboard the ship that bears his name. And you've shown your greatness as well. So to all of you who serve here aboard the USS Harry S. Truman, this Vice President has a simple word for you: Thank you for your service. And I urge you to press on. Maintain the standards of excellence that are synonymous with this ship throughout its more than 20-year history. Be vigilant. Mind your mission. Take care of one another. The American people are counting on you. You know, my life never took me into the uniform of the United States, but I'm the proud son of a combat veteran from the Korean War, and I'm the proud father of an aviator in the United States Marine Corps. In fact, just last year, as his mother and I were awaiting word, our son did his first capture aboard an aircraft carrier. I think we were more nervous than he was. (Laughter.) The truth of the matter is, we were confident not so much in his abilities, but in the people that had trained him; the people on that deck that were looking after him as they called the ball and made his way in. So let me just close today with a word of gratitude on behalf of all the parents around America who appreciate what you do, appreciate the way you look after our sailors, our airmen, and all those who serve on this ship, who come and go into harm's way from this place and sail with you into harm's way. We all know that your service comes with sacrifice for you, for your families. And I want you to know that as you serve and as you sail, you do not go alone. You carry with you the strength and the pride and the confidence of the American people.And you also carry with you one more thing, and that is the prayers of millions of Americans who carry each one of you before the throne of grace every day, who pray for your families and for your mission, for your safety, and for your success. And I pray that as you sail and as you serve, you would do so with confidence and with faith yourself. And as the Old Book tells us, ""If [you] rise on the wings of the dawn if [you] go up to the heavens even there [His] hand will guide [you] and [His] right hand will hold [you] fast."" And you do not go alone. As I look out across this deck today, I see men and women who have answered the call to put on the uniform of the United States of America, the greatest nation in the history of the world. And I know, as long as we have men and women of courage and selflessness, like all of you gathered here; as long as we have heroes willing to put the lives on the line for our freedom; as long as we have patriots like all of you, we will protect this nation. We will defend our freedom. We will forge a future of security, and prosperity, and peace for ourselves and our posterity. God bless the crew of the USS Harry S. Truman as you sail on in defense of America. Thank you. And God bless you.

VSMP15201989	Mike Pence	2019-05-01	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association Aguila Awards Luncheon	speech	"Thank you, Tony. Thank you for that warm welcome, warm introduction. To Tony Chapa, to Mary Cox, and most especially to all of the outstanding members of HAPCOA , the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association , thank you for your service. We are proud of each and every one of you and your families. (Applause.) And I just left the Oval Office a few minutes ago, so allow me to also bring appreciation and admiration from a great champion of law enforcement and a great champion of all of the men and women of HAPCOA. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We are both grateful for what each and every one of you do. And as I begin, let me , let me offer my congratulations to all the honorees in this afternoon's event. To Manuel de la Rosa, to Nelson Rivera, to Cathy Sanz, to Omar Lopez , congratulations on your very fitting and very deserving honor today at this event. (Applause.) And I just had the opportunity to visit with Victor Avila and the parents of the late Jaime Zapata. You know, the Bible says that no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends. And we think of Jaime, and we're honored to be with Mom and Dad today. And I want to assure you that we will never forget the service and sacrifice of your courageous son. Join me in congratulating the Gold Medal winners one more time. (Applause.)And let me say it is a particular honor for me to be here to bestow the next award, and I think your last one of the day, on an extraordinarily dedicated law enforcement professional. The Aguila Statue Award is the highest honor this organization bestows. To qualify, a nominee, I'm told, must demonstrate a commitment to public safety and to the principles of this organization. He must be an individual who goes above and beyond the call of duty, blazes a new path for Hispanic American law enforcement officers, and is a role model in the Hispanic American community. And let me tell you, you could have chosen no one better, in my eyes, than Special Agent in Charge, Hector Hernandez. Congratulations, Hector. (Applause.) And I have to tell you, when I heard Hector was getting this award, I just said, ""Can I come?"" (Laughter.) Because while he currently is now leading the Vice Presidential Protective Detail , in fact, he's the first Hispanic American in history to be the Special Agent in Charge of the Vice Presidential detail. (Applause.) I have to tell you he's been a fan favorite of the Pence family since we signed on to this job because of who he is and because of his character, because of his courage, because of his professionalism. And it's my great honor to be here today. But I know I'm also here on behalf of the team of more than 300 Special Agents and Uniformed Officers that he leads on a very regular basis. It is remarkable to see the kind of leadership that Hector Hernandez represents and embodies each and every day. He's a professional to his very core. Ever the Secret Service Agent, he shows very little emotion except when we provoke him with a bad joke , (laughter) , or a family story. He's also a man of personal courage. And those of you that know Hector well know that he's also a man of faith. And I say of him and I say of all of you who wear the uniform in this room , and it's always noteworthy to me that the only time that the Nazarene in the Old Book ever said that he was amazed was when he encountered a law enforcement officer. It's a wonderful story. It took place on a stream in a little called Capernaum. And the Bible records that Jesus was walking from the synagogue back to Peter's mother's home, and he was approached by a centurion , a law enforcement officer of his day. And the officer, as the Bible records, walked up to him and spoke of a young one in his home who was ill. And as Jesus began to walk in his direction, he said to him, ""I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof."" He said, ""Rather "" he said, ""I'm a man under authority."" He said, ""I tell one to do this and they do it. I tell another to do this and they do it."" And he said, ""You only say the word and they'll be healed."" And in that moment , and you can go read it for yourself , it says that Jesus was amazed. He was amazed as he saw the faith, as he saw the humility, as he saw the orientation to authority that he found in that law enforcement officer. And I want to tell you, since the first time that I saw his service and saw his character, and as we witness every day in the service and sacrifices each and every one of you make, I'm amazed , I'm amazed at the job you do every day. I truly am. And we're amazed at the job each and every one of you do. The way you consider our lives more important than your own, it's a truly humbling thing. But the truth is, people that have known Hector Hernandez for a long time know that it really is emblematic of his truly remarkable life and career. He's no stranger to all of you. I know that he was actually president of this organization from 2008 to 2010. But his story began long before that. Native of El Paso, Texas. Comes from a long line of champion boxers. We were talking about it not long ago on a visit to Mexico for an inauguration. I got the whole story. And I also learned about his youthful rebellion when he decided to be a wrestler instead of a boxer. (Laughter.) And, man, was he ever a wrestler. It wasn't just a hobby. I actually pulled the records on this. He won the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference championship three times, earned All-American honors twice. Not only competed on the U.S. national wrestling team during their tour of Russia, he also won the national championship that year, pinning three of his opponents in less than 20 seconds , the three quickest pins in the entire tournament. And he did it all while he was double majoring in political science and sociology, and later earned a master's degree at New Mexico Highlands University. I think that's worth a round of applause. That's pretty impressive right there. (Applause.) After he graduated, Hector found his calling, and it was among all of you, in law enforcement. His work ethic and his talent made him rise like a rocket. He began as an investigator in the Office of the Inspector General at HHS. He was recruited by the United States Secret Service. He started in the Dallas Field Office and later moved to Washington, D.C., where he joined the ranks of the protection , Presidential Protection Detail. Throughout his career, he has been at crucial moments in the life of the nation and he's distinguished himself with his courage and his energetic response in challenging situations. After the Oklahoma City Bombing, he and three other Secret Service agents literally dug through the rubble of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building to recover the remains of six colleagues whose lives were lost in that attack. I'm told that Hector's testimony in Timothy McVeigh's trial proved crucial in securing a conviction. And he also served his country with distinction on that dark day, the 11th day of September 2001. He was working midnight shift at the White House after President Bush had returned from Florida to demonstrate the strength of our nation. And the President was in the White House, but when an unidentified aircraft began to approach the White House, it was Hector who rushed in and sped the President and the First Lady to safety. In addition to leading the Secret Service training academy, he has actually served three Presidents: President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush, as I mentioned, and President Barack Obama. And today, Hector is a member of what's known as the Senior Executive Service, which is a distinction shared by the top 1 percent of federal employees. He has an extraordinarily incredible and impressive record and only one character flaw that I can identify , (laughter) , and that is that he is an insufferable fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. (Laughter.) And never lets it , never lets it go unmentioned with this Colts fan from Indianapolis. (Laughter.) So he's got an incredible career and well deserving of the award that he'll receive today. But those of you that know Hector well , and I know so many of you in the room do , know that other than his service and his faith, what matters most in Hector's life and his family , is his family, rather. And we are so blessed today to be joined by his wonderful wife, Jodi, who deserves a round of applause. (Applause.) To talk to Hector for more than a couple of minutes is to hear about family, and I know Hector and the family went through a year of highs and lows. He was there when his family bid his mother goodbye and prayed her into glory. And he was there when his unworthy son-in-law, Brett, married his perfect daughter, Sarah. (Laughter.) And they're also with us today. (Applause.) (Laughs.) I got to tell you, maybe it was that wrestling career that made you nervous. (Laughter.) But I got to tell you, I've seen some nervous dads going into weddings before, but this was a nervous dad. (Laughter.) And , but it was all about his deep love for Sarah and for you and for the whole family. His son, Samuel, is also with us here today. And we're delighted. Give this whole family another round of applause for the way they've served their country. (Inaudible.) (Applause.) Hector, you really do represent the best of law enforcement and the best of this country, and you're an inspiration to men and women in law enforcement. And I hope, through this honor, you're also an inspiration to men and women in the Hispanic community who either serve in law enforcement today or who aspire to serve in law enforcement today. And we're grateful for your example. And the truth is, he is deserving of this award for many reasons , for a record of public service that is truly extraordinary. But I think he's also deserving of it because he has a heart. To know Hector Hernandez is to know a man who loves his family, and loves his country, and loves his God, and lives that out with integrity each and every day. And so now it is my distinct privilege , and to no less extent, my joy , to pay a debt of gratitude and a debt of honor that my little family owes, and that all the families that have been the beneficiaries of his service would also, I know, want to be here to share, to present the 2019 Aguila Statue Award of the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association to Special Agent in Charge, Hector Hernandez. Congratulations, Hector. (Applause.) I'm proud to be with you."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1340732/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-hispanic-american-police-command-officers-association-aguila-awards-luncheon&speechType=1	Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Criminal Justice		Baltimore, MD	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-hispanic-american-police-command-officers-association-aguila-awards-luncheon-baltimore-md/
VSMP25201988	Mike Pence	2019-05-02	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the National Day of Prayer Service	speech	"Good morning. Please be seated. To members of our Cabinet, leaders in faith and public life, and to all our distinguished guests, it is an honor for Karen and me to be with President Trump, our First Lady, and all of you here in the Rose Garden as we mark this National Day of Prayer for the third year in a row here at the White House. (Applause.) The Bible tells us to be faithful in prayer and that the ""effective and fervent prayers of a righteous [people] availeth much."" And since the founding of this nation, the American people have believed in prayer. It is the thread that runs through every era of American history. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress established a day of fasting and prayer. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln, from these very grounds, urged Americans to pray so that, in his words, ""the united cry of the nation [would] be heard on high and answered with blessing."" In 1952, President Harry Truman and the Congress formally established this National Day of Prayer and set aside each year for the American people to turn to God in prayer and meditation. Ever since then, every President has issued a proclamation in honor of this great tradition. And President Donald Trump continues that tradition today. (Applause.) As President Trump said just two years ago in this Rose Garden, in his words, ""We are a nation of faith."" And I can assure you, at a time when religious belief is often marginalized and even ridiculed, in this White House, under this President, we believe in prayer. (Applause.) In fact, the President has made a practice of opening every Cabinet meeting in prayer. In fact, he is, at this moment in time, one of only four Presidents in American history who have issued multiple proclamations calling the American people to prayer in a single year. We believe we always do well to go to the Lord in prayer. But it seems especially important these days. No one should ever fear for their safety in a house of worship in America or anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And yet, we live in a time when we have witnessed unspeakable attacks on people of faith: at a synagogue in California, just a few short days ago; at mosques in New Zealand; at historically black churches in Louisiana that we'll be visiting tomorrow. As Americans, we mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those grieve. And we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms. (Applause.) But on this National Day of Prayer, the American people, and people of every faith in this country, can be confident they have a champion and a defender of faith and religious liberty in President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It's true. From early in this administration, President Trump has taken steps to ensure that the federal government will never, ever penalize anyone for their religious beliefs ever again. (Applause.) Today, the President will announce even more steps to acknowledge the vital role that people of faith and faith-based organizations play in our national life. So on behalf of our family, and as you will soon hear from the First Family, thank you for your prayers for our President, for all those who serve in authority at every level. Thank you for your prayers for our armed forces and those who serve in law enforcement and our first responders. Thank you for our teachers and religious leaders and all who lead in business and private sector across this country. And thank you for your prayers for all of the American people. Today we pray for America. And as we pray, let's pray with confidence, as was inscribed in those ancient words millennia ago, that if His people, who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, that He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this nation: He'll hear from Heaven and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you for joining us for this National Day of Prayer. (Applause.) God bless you all. And God bless America.

VSMP35201987	Mike Pence	2019-05-03	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Hallway Feeds Employees	speech	"That's what we call a ""twin spin."" Thank you very much. And thank you all for being out late on a Friday, on a busy weekend here in the Horse Capital of the world. Hello, Kentucky! (Applause.) And it is really great to be here with all of you and to really have the opportunity to be in the midst of a great American success story: ""family-owned,"" ""hand-shake operated"" , join me in thanking all the great team here at Hallway Feeds! What a great American company. (Applause.) And I'm just delighted to be here with a great member of our Cabinet, Secretary Alex Acosta, who just shared the exciting news today. I'll talk about what's happening all across the country, but how about the lowest unemployment ever recorded in the history of Kentucky? Four percent unemployment rate. Thank you for bringing the great news, Secretary Acosta. (Applause.) And more to the point, would you all join me in thanking Governor Matt Bevin for leading this state with conservative conviction and delivery for the people of Kentucky? (Applause.) Governor Bevin is a hard man to follow at a podium. I learned that a long time ago. And I will tell you that when I was governor of Indiana, and we first became acquainted, I just knew that he'd bring a level of energy, conservative principle, and real results for the state of Kentucky. And I'm just so proud , so proud of your leadership. The President and I are truly grateful for the way that you have turned Kentucky around. Governor Matt Bevin, thank you so much for being with us here today. (Applause.) It really means the world to me. And our hosts today, Lee and Julia Hall, thank you for being here. Thanks for being such a great example of a great American company. And as I mentioned to all these people and the great Hallway Feeds team, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine who is a great fan of American farmers and a great fan of the people of Kentucky. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as you heard a little bit from this podium already, when this President and I were running for this office back in 2016, we really believed after eight years of economic growth that we were told, remember, was the ""new normal""; the eight years of economic growth in the most powerful economy in the history of the world, growth of less than 2 percent , we were told that was about what it was going to take. In fact, in early 2017, a man by the name of Larry Summers, who was the top economic advisor for the last President, actually said that anyone who believed that we could get to 3 percent economic growth also had to believe in the Tooth Fairy, or something like that. Did you hear about that? Well, this President and I went right to work. With the strong support of your governor and with the steadfast support of Congressman Andy Barr, who is also with us today , (applause) , we cut taxes at a historic level. We rolled back federal regulation. We unleashed American energy. We negotiated new, free, and fair trade deals with nations around the world. And as I stand before you today, I know you already heard about it in the news this morning, but it's amazing to think 5.8 million new jobs since Election Day; 263,000 jobs in the month of April alone; and the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. The American economy is roaring! (Applause.) And it's all happening because of the policies that this President and the people of Kentucky supported back in 2016. We've been able to move forward an agenda that really is reviving the American economy, and it's impacting jobs right here in the state of Kentucky. We talked about that record low unemployment rate. But in the midst of those 5.8 million new jobs, I'm happy to report 36,000 new, good-paying jobs right here in the state of Kentucky alone. Thank you, Governor. Thanks for being a partner with us for Kentucky's prosperity. (Applause.) And the great news is, is , I'll tell you, when I was governor of Indiana , which is a state that gets along with Kentucky well, other than during basketball season , (laughter) , truthfully, just like Kentucky, you know, in Indiana we do two things well: We make things and we grow things. And the truth is that wages here in Kentucky, and wages across my home state all across America, have been a stubborn economic indicator for years. And probably the thing the President and I are most excited about is that, over the last year, with all the economic growth that is happening, wages are rising at the fastest pace in the last 10 years. And working blue-collar Americans are getting the most rapid increase of wages of all. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. And the American Dream is working again. (Applause.) Incredible. It's incredible. And it's all a result of putting commonsense, conservative policies into practice. And the impact you can see right in the Hallways here at this great American company. You know, as I talk to the team here at Hallway Feeds, and that you already heard from this podium , from Lee , that after those tax cuts passed, they've actually been able, in this company, to expand to new markets in Florida and New York, Texas, and throughout the Mid-Atlantic. And it's an incredible story of this company that it's been a mainstay of the local economy over the last 55 years. In fact, for decades, you and your 30 employees have provided the fastest horses in the world, with the best feed in the world. In fact, as we were being introduced to some of the feed, I noticed , what is it, Race 13 feed? Was that what was in that bowl? I did go ahead and take a little nibble of it , (laughter) , just so , so I think that increases the likelihood that the next winner of the Kentucky Derby and I had the same thing for dinner the night before. (Applause.) So congratulations, Hallways Feeds, on all your success! The truth is, as Lee told me a little bit earlier today, it's been the President's economic policies that have made it possible for this company to expand. I mean, the truth of the matter is, when you look at 5.8 million jobs, I always bristled throughout my career in the Congress and as governor, and now as your Vice President, when you'd hear elected officials talk about jobs they created. I mean, what you all know here, and what Lee and the family know here, is that it's businesses across America that create jobs. And companies like Hallway Feeds are emblematic of companies that have been able to seize on these new policies of less taxes for businesses and individuals, less regulation, more access to affordable energy, and better trade deals to be able to grow and expand. And I got to tell you, the most inspiring thing that I heard from this podium earlier today is the fact that, in the midst of all this expansion of Hallway Feeds , did I actually hear it? , the salary here at Hallway Feeds has grown by nearly 20 percent. This is a company that invests in the people that make the company work. (Applause.) That is a great, great American story. But for all we've done before, you know, it's just what President Trump likes to call a ""good start."" And I want to promise you, Kentucky, that we've only just begun to drive forward the kind of policies that will give companies just like this one, families just like yours, the opportunity to continue to live the American Dream and pursue it. And chief of among those, to hear the President tell it, is that we continue to negotiate trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal and put American jobs, American farmers, and American workers first. And that's exactly what we've done. (Applause.) As I speak to you today , as I speak to you today, we negotiated a new trade deal with South Korea. We've opened up opportunities for new exports in South America. We've begun discussions with the European Union and Japan for new free trade deals. Of course, you're all watching the headlines about our negotiations with China. Our team just arrived back yesterday. We're working to expand the opportunity for exports and level the playing field with China. China today is fully one-half of our international trade deficit. And we've made it very clear , but the President has to President Xi and all the leadership in China , that things have to change. They need to open their markets up to America's manufactured goods. They need to open their markets up to American agricultural goods. And we are driving forward in the days ahead for a free and fair and reciprocal deal with China. And we're going to keep fighting for it every single day. I promise you. (Applause.) But I came here today , I came here today to tell you that there's a trade deal that's already been negotiated. It's called the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement , USMCA, for short. And it basically is a , it's another promise kept by President Trump. And it's been remarkable to think, a quarter century ago, the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed into law by President Clinton. And since that time, I don't have to tell the people of Kentucky any more than I'd have to tell the people of Indiana or anywhere across the Heartland that NAFTA costs jobs. While there were opportunities in agriculture for exports, the reality was that, over the last 25 years, we've literally seen hundreds of thousands of jobs, thousands of factories close and go south of the border. President Trump said we could do better. And President Trump sat down and we negotiated a free, fair, reciprocal deal with Mexico and Canada. The President has done his job. Now it's time for Congress to do their job and pass the USMCA this summer. (Applause.) And it's a good deal. It's a good deal. The truth is, NAFTA undercut American workers, undermined good-paying jobs that strengthen and grow our middle class. But those days are over. Under the USMCA, I'm proud to report to you that we're going to make sure more goods and more materials are built right here in the United States of America, especially in the automotive sector. We're eliminating unfair trade barriers to American dairy and poultry. We're creating strong protections for intellectual property that spur innovation. And as one of the guys working the line here at Hallway Feeds told me, we're also addressing all the new technology and new coding that's gone into effect. When NASA [NAFTA] was signed into law, there wasn't anything called iPhones. There wasn't any or half of the new technology that businesses operate on every day. And the USMCA modernizes our trading relationship, and it's in a way that's going to put American jobs and American workers first. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, a report released just last week , we believe when the USMCA is signed into law, it will add 176,000 jobs to our economy and $68 billion of investment. In fact, American exports to Canada, we project, will increase by $19 billion, and will increase to Mexico by $14 billion right out of the gate. But the clock is ticking, men and women, and that's really why I'm traveling all over the country. I was in Norfolk, Virginia, earlier this week. I was in Detroit, Michigan, last week. And I wanted to take some time to talk with all of you today. Because the truth is, we've got to get Congress , we got to get Congress to move of the USMCA. Now, I know we're going to be able to count on Congressman Andy Barr, who has been a great, great champion for free and fair and reciprocal trade in support of this administration. And I know we're going to count on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul to move this trade deal to the President's desk. (Applause.) But we need all of you to let your voice be heard , not just to those elected officials, but really, the Heartland needs to be heard from about the need to have the USMCA signed into law. The truth is, for all that we've seen in this economy, the President and I truly do believe that we've only begun to explore the boundaries of the full potential of the American economy. And by signing into law a new trading agreement for Mexico and Canada and the United States, we believe that we'll create even more momentum in an economy that's already roaring. And so I want to ask you to spread the word. I mean, this is a company that does business all over the country, and we want you to spend the word to your suppliers; spread the word to your customers. Say, ""I was hanging out late at Hallway Feeds on a Friday afternoon, and I ran into Mike"" , (laughter) , ""and he told me this USMCA would be a huge win for Kentucky, a huge win for America, and every single one of us needs to say it's time for Congress to pass the USMCA and send it to the President's desk."" Okay? That's the message I'm asking you to deliver. (Applause.) So I'm going to get out of your hair. I know you all have got a big weekend ahead of you here in Kentucky. And, in fact, I'm going to head off from here to head to the Governors Ball to greet some good folks. And it will be my great honor to do just that. You know, this is such a great state with such great traditions. But maybe , there may be no tradition greater than the Kentucky Derby. Growing up in southern Indiana, I would see my mom and dad put on their finest and head south on I-65 to go to the Kentucky Derby, year after year. The whole nation will be focused on Kentucky. And, you know, the Derby has captured the imagination of Americans and people around the world for generations, and I know it will again tomorrow. But, you know, I've always believed that whether it's the Kentucky Derby, or that race we run up in Indianapolis , you know, Americans love racing because we love competition. We love to compete, and we love to win. And I got to tell you, men and women, I absolutely believe that with President Donald Trump in the White House, we've only just begun to win for the American economy. We've only just begun to strengthen our military and our standing in the world. We've only just begun to lay a strong foundation of conservative principle and constitutional conviction in the courts of this country. And so I want to ask for your continued support for all that we're doing. And I'll also ask for your prayers. You know, the sweetest words the President and I ever here are, ""I'm praying for you."" And I already heard it today when I arrived in Kentucky, and I heard it when I was down at , visiting a church that had been subject to an arson fire , down in Louisiana earlier today. Mount Pleasant Baptist Church and two other predominantly black churches, historic black churches, in Louisiana were set afire. But I have to tell you, the faith that I saw in those communities as we stood with the rubble of Mount Pleasant Baptist Church behind us was deeply inspiring to me. It reminded me of the strength and the resilience and the faith of the people of this country, which I believe has always been and always will be the wellspring of our greatness. So pray for our country. Pray for the progress that we're making. Pray for all of us that have positions of authority, and especially all of those who wear the uniform of the United States in our armed forces and in law enforcement. And I truly do believe, with President Trump in the White House; with strong, conservative leadership in the Congress, the House of Representatives, the United States Senate, from here in Kentucky; with all of your support and with God's help, we'll make even more progress than we could possibly imagine. We'll pass these kind of deals that will create new jobs and opportunities here in Kentucky beyond anything that we could ever imagine before. And we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Kentucky. (Applause.) God bless you. Now, go enjoy the Kentucky Derby. It's great to be with you all.

VSMP65201986	Mike Pence	2019-05-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Satellite 2019 Conference	speech	"Well, thank you all. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. And let me thank Mark Holmes for his kind introduction. But I also want to thank Tory Bruno of the United Launch Alliance for the other introduction. I haven't gotten two good introductions at a single event in a long time. Give them both a big round of applause. They are important voices in this industry and they're great friends. (Applause.) It is a great honor to be with all of you today. And all of you who are gathered here are extraordinary leaders. You're innovators. You're pioneers. You're the men and women who are helping to forge our future in space. And it's my great honor, nearly 30 years and running, to be here at the 2019 Satellite Conference with people that are crafting the future in space. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) You know, since day one of our administration, we've worked to restore America's proud leadership in space, because America's leadership is essential to our nation's security, our prosperity, and our very way of life. So let me begin by bringing greetings from a man who is securing American leadership here on Earth and in the vast heavens above. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) In his Inaugural Address to the nation a little more than two years ago, President Trump declared, in his words, that America stood ""at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space."" From the first days of this administration, we've been standing with those who've been supporting America's renewed leadership in space. But we've also been working to get our economy moving again. And the businesses represented here don't need me to tell you about the impact that it's had on our economy. Over the last two and a half years, I'm proud to report, we've rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history in a similar period of time. We've unleashed American energy. We've negotiated new and fair and reciprocal trade deals. And we passed tax cuts for individuals and businesses across America, and the American economy is roaring, including businesses just like those represented here. (Applause.) It's amazing to think, with the job numbers that just came out , 5.8 million new jobs created over the last two and a half years, including more than 260,000 jobs in the month of April alone, I'm proud to report. And I want to thank the companies that represented here in those numbers , that more Americans are working today than ever before. And our technology industry is helping lead the way for renewed American prosperity. (Applause.) And we thank you. But what brings us here today is that companies in the commercial space industry have not only been an important part of our economic success, you also are critical to the success of our nation and to the advancement of our ideals in the vast expanse of space. The work that each of you do here on Earth, in the skies, and in space spurs scientific discovery, drives innovation, and then fills the rising generation with wonder and pride. Space companies have driven incredible economic growth here in the United States and, frankly, around the world. Just two years ago, the satellite industry alone generated $350 billion in revenue. And studies predict that number will increase to more than a trillion dollars annually over the next two decades. And around the globe, space is recognized as an industry of the future in particular. Eighteen billion dollars has been invested in companies throughout the space industry in the last decade and , with the majority of that funding, I'm proud to say, going to companies right here in the United States. But it's not just about growth and revenues and income. Space industry, as all of you know, also improves the lives of our people in countless ways. It makes the marvel of global positioning possible. And while most Americans use GPS to find the quickest route to work, this technology also provides critical information to our warfighters; it gives them the ability to dominate the battlefield when they need to fight and win. We've witnessed the power of commercial satellites to re-connect isolated communities in the wake of natural disasters, providing vital emergency communication between those impacted and with first responders and those that are providing relief. And in just last week, the world watched in wonder as Blue Origin and SpaceX proved once again that private pioneers will help us cultivate the vast expanses of low-Earth orbit and explore the furthest reaches of space. We are proud of our private space industry in the United States of America. (Applause.) As President Trump said memorably once, ""Rich guys love rockets."" (Laughter.) And our administration has been absolutely committed to making sure that our space entrepreneurs have the flexibility, the predictability to be able to make investments and help lead and transform our impact in space, particularly when it comes to low-Earth orbit. You know, I've personally seen the importance of this industry and its work firsthand. I traveled across the country on the President's behalf to meet with the men and women who, just like all of you gathered here, are forging America's future in space. At California's Mojave Desert, I saw the ships that will carry the first generation of space tourists to the edge of the Earth's atmosphere. In Alabama, I met with the engineers and technicians that are working on the SLS , the Space Launch System , that'll carry us deeper into space than ever before. And in Colorado, I toured the factory where we're producing the latest and most advanced GPS satellites in the world. And I know that these achievements are just emblematic of the incredible work that all of you do. So why don't you give yourselves a round of applause for leading the way of technical innovation in space. (Applause.) Under President Trump's leadership we've made great progress toward renewing America's proud legacy of leadership in space as well. In our very first year in office, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, President Trump made the decision to revive the National Space Council. And it's my great honor to serve as the Chairman of the newly reconstituted Council today. I'll never forget, when we were both on the campaign trail, we were still getting to know one another, and then the candidate came up to me and he said, ""You know, there was a thing called the National Space Council, back in the day."" But it hadn't been around for about a quarter of century. And he said, ""I was wondering if you'd be interested in chairing that because Vice Presidents have chaired it in the past."" Now, he didn't know that some of the greatest memories of my youth , probably of yours as well , were sitting in front of a black-and-white television, 50 years ago, when Neil Armstrong took ""one small step for mankind."" He didn't know that my wife and I, when our kids were young, actually vacationed at Cape Canaveral , not for the beaches, but for the rockets , because we wanted our children to have their imagination fired by America's proud legacy of leadership in space. He didn't know that when I was elected to Congress in the year 2000, the only committee that I asked to be on was the NASA sub-committee. So, again, when he said to me, ""Would you be interested in serving as Chairman of the newly reconstituted National Space Council?"" I looked at him and said, ""Would I?"" And it's the greatest honor of my life to help this President renew American leadership in space. (Applause.) It's true. And from early on, President Trump has been taking action to do just that. The President signed what is known as ""Space Policy Directive-1,"" which makes it our national policy of the United States to return to the moon, and to put Americans on Mars, and to bring renewed focus to human exploration in the infinite frontier. Just two months ago, during the fifth meeting of the National Space Council in ""Rocket City"" in Huntsville, Alabama, it was also my privilege to announce that, at President Trump's direction, the United States will return to the moon within the next five years, and the first woman and the next man on the moon will be Americans. (Applause.) This year, our administration is incredibly proud that, before the year is out, we'll once again launch American astronauts, on American rockets, from American soil into the vast expanse of space. But, do you know, to fully unlock the mysteries of space, the President Trump recognizes that we have to look beyond the halls of government, beyond NASA, for input and guidance. That's why we assembled this Users' Advisories Group in the National Space Council, which, I'm proud to say has brought together some of the brightest minds and biggest talents in the country to help accelerate innovation across the space enterprise. And we're honored to be joined here today by several members of the UAG. So, I'd like to give you a chance to thank them for the incredible contributions they're making to the life of our nation. You already heard from Tory Bruno, but also join me in thanking Gwynne Shotwell, Bob Smith, and Tim Ellis. Would you all just stand up and take a bow? (Applause.) These people are working around the clock to renew American leadership in space. You know, American companies are on the cutting edge of the space industry , developing new rockets, spaceships, satellites, and technologies that are taking us further into space, faster than ever before. And under the President's leadership, we're also working , I want to assure you , to make it easier than ever for trailblazing companies like yours to be able to succeed and prosper. We've been streamlining the licensing regimes that oversee launch, re-entry, and new commercial operations in space , removing unnecessary regulations that have increased costs and stifled innovation. We've also developed our nation's first comprehensive space traffic management policy to help you navigate the thousands of satellites and other manmade objects orbiting the Earth at this very moment. We know this policy will encourage companies like yours to partner with government agencies to develop data-sharing systems, technical guidelines, safety standards that will help minimize debris and avoid satellite collisions during launch and while in orbit. We're incredibly proud of it. We're streamlining and deregulating space. We figure that works here on Earth, and it's going to work in low-Earth orbit as well. (Applause.) And this summer, I'm proud to say, the Department of Commerce will unveil the first part of its open-architecture data repository, which will provide access to a basic level of ""space situational awareness,"" based on both commercial data and the space catalog compiled by the Department of Defense. We're bringing the data together so that companies just like yours have the best real-time information to navigate in space. And to give the engineers and entrepreneurs here today the tools you need to continue driving American innovation, we will ensure that you have continued access to wireless spectrum. Today, spectrum is more valuable than ever, as more industries begin to make use of the next generation of wireless networks , 5G. This revolutionary technology will improve the way in which Americans work, learn, travel, farm, run businesses, and communicate , from the cellphones in our pockets to the autonomous cars on the roads someday. But President Trump has made it clear, the race to 5G is a race that America will win. (Applause.) And we will make sure these 5G networks are secure. But as you all know, spectrum bandwidth is limited. So to ensure that it is used ""as efficiently and effectively as possible,"" last year President Trump issued a directive to every department and agency to ""increase spectrum access for all users"" and to give innovators in all industries access to the spectrum you need to compete and win in the global marketplace, including all of you here in the space industry. Just last month, we announced that we're going to hold the largest spectrum auction in American history later this year, with the help of leaders like Assistant Secretary David Redl, who is here with us today; and someone we're particularly proud of, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who's become the first American in the top leadership position of the International Telecommunications Union , give her a round of applause. Where's Doreen? (Applause.) Our administration, I promise you, with these great leaders, is going to continue to increase spectrum across access so that companies like yours can continue to build the technologies of the future that improve our lives and expand opportunity. Yet, while their capabilities increase, the truth of the matter is that there's no guarantee that nations around the world share our same values, our ideals, or our commitment to freedom and the rule of law and peace. And that's what makes our leadership in space so important. The truth is, nations from Russia and China to North Korea and Iran have pursued weapons to jam, blind, and disable our navigation and communications satellites via electronic attacks from the ground. Recently, we've even see nations working on bringing new weapons of war into space itself. From anti-satellite weapons and airborne lasers, to highly threatening, on-orbit activities and evasive hypersonic missiles, our competitors and our adversaries have been aggressively developing and deploying technologies that put our technology and put our prosperity and our security at risk. President Trump said it clearly: Today, we recognize space is ""a war-fighting domain, just like the land [and] air and sea."" And America is going to be as dominant for our security in space, as we are here on Earth. (Applause.) To meet the emerging threats, President Trump has taken decisive action to strengthen American power. From the first days of this administration, we've been rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy. And last year, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including renewed resources to enhance the resilience of our space defense systems. But as the President said, ""It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space."" And so we will. So for the sake of our security and to ensure an orderly space environment necessary for our continued prosperity and success, at President Trump's direction, we are working, as we speak, with the Congress to stand up the sixth branch of our Armed Forces; the United States Space Force will soon be a reality. (Applause.) You know, America will always seek peace , in space and here on Earth. And history proves that peace comes through strength. And in the realm of outer space, the United States Space Force will be that strength. It will safeguard our ideals. It will safeguard our interests. And it will safeguard the interests of all who cherish freedom. So as we prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, I think we'd do well to remember the example set by those three space pioneers I referred to earlier today, and, frankly, to all the remarkable men and women who helped put them on the moon , innovators, engineers, just like all of you gathered here. Through extraordinary determination, through courage and grit, a half century ago, they proved to the world that America can accomplish anything that we set our minds to. And we're in the process of proving that once again. They chose to do something extraordinary in their time, as President Kennedy said, ""not because it was easy, but because it was hard."" And so do we choose. They knew that the rules and values of space, like every great frontier, would be written by those who had the courage to get there first and the commitment to stay. And today, President Trump and our entire administration believe it is our duty to ensure that our most cherished values and ideals are the foundation of our future in space , that it's a future of freedom, of free commerce, and free enterprise, and security. So as we renew our commitment to lead, we will do so going with confidence. Confidence in the extraordinary innovation and capabilities of all of you gathered here, and that great American spirit that's being put to our space enterprise in new and in renewed ways. And confidence in the rising generation of young men and women, and, frankly, little boys and girls that inspired by the innovations that you are bringing about every day. And they see a future for America and the free world , not just here on Earth, but in the vast expanse of space. So thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today. I wanted to express my warm welcome to each of you back to Washington, D.C. for this Satellite Conference. And I have to tell you, I'm absolutely confident, when I look at all the great companies represented here, that the best days for America, the best days for American leadership in space, and the best days for extraordinary technological advances, far beyond anything we could ask or imagine, are still ahead. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America.

VSMP75201985	Mike Pence	2019-05-07	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Washington Conference on the Americas	speech	"Great. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman Gluski. Thank you for that wonderful introduction. To President-Elect Bukele, to Vice President Ramirez, to all the leaders in public and in business life gathered here today: It is an honor to be here at the U.S. State Department, at the Crossroad of the Americas, the 49th Annual Washington Conference on the Americas. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.) And as I begin, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great friend of all of those who cherish freedom across this hemisphere of freedom. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Before I begin, let me reflect on some welcome news. Last fall, we made clear to Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma that the arrest and jailing of two journalists was deeply troubling to millions of Americans. And we urged their release. Today, the world learned those two Reuters journalists were released after spending more than 500 days in prison, where they'd been jailed simply for doing their job: reporting atrocities committed against the Rohingya people. In America and across this hemisphere, we believe in democratic ideals, including the freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. And we welcome the release of these two journalists , (applause) , and we hope their release signals a positive and permanent respect for a free and independent press. But what brings us here today is to discuss the theme of this conference, which is ""disruption and transformation"" in the Americas. And it is unquestionable that over the last two years there has been profound transformation across Latin America. Since the earliest days of this administration, President Trump has worked with our partners in the region to build a safer, stronger, and more prosperous Western Hemisphere. And the results speak for themselves. Under the BUILD Act, we've pledged up to $60 billion in development financing to help our partners build infrastructure they need to grow. We've expanded access to affordable, American-made energy through our Americas Crece initiative. We've promoted free, fair, and reciprocal trade, forging a new trade deal, like the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement. We've also strengthened our security ties. And under the President's leadership, the United States has conducted joint law enforcement actions across this hemisphere and reinvigorated the fight against illegal drugs by helping bring thousands of charges against dangerous gang members and money launderers.And it's also been my honor to travel to Latin America five different times in our first two and a half years. And I've witnessed this transformation firsthand, and we've worked to strengthen the ties that bind freedom-loving nations and peoples all across this hemisphere of freedom. In Ecuador, I saw President Moreno support press freedom and renew the fight in his country against illegal drugs and corruption. In Argentina, President Macri and I eliminated longstanding trade barriers between our two countries for pork producers. In Brazil, we laid the groundwork for greater cooperation in space. And in Lima, Peru, I was honored to represent the United States at a historic conference where 35 nations pledged to fight against corruption in their governments and renew our commitment to freedom. Since my very first visit to Latin America two years ago, the people of the Western Hemisphere have voted in election after election for prosperity, for security, for transparency and the rule of law in their governments. And the United States has stood with them every step of the way. And America will always stand with our neighbors when they stand for freedom. (Applause.) As President Trump said in his first address to the United Nations, in his words, ""Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions."" And as the largest trading partner and source of investment in the Western Hemisphere, that's exactly what America has done. As the President also promised, ""a new day is coming in Latin America,"" and so it is. ""Across the Western Hemisphere, socialism is dying, and liberty, prosperity, and democracy are being reborn"" right before our eyes. So there's been transformation over the last two years. But as we all know, there's been extraordinary disruption as well. And today, the single greatest source of disruption, the single greatest disrupter of peace and prosperity in the Western Hemisphere has come from the regime of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, and from their desperate attempts to cling to power. Venezuela's neighbors know better than anyone how hard it is to bring liberty to a land that has long lived under dictatorship. And today, the United States of America reaffirms our commitment to the Venezuelan people and to our partners in the region. We will continue to stand with the people of Venezuela until libertad is restored. (Applause.) And recent scenes out of Caracas have been heartbreaking and deeply troubling. It's extraordinary to think of it. Last week, the world saw armored vehicles run over unarmed citizens; military forces firing tear gas at church goers; and hundreds of people, including children, be thrown into jail because they dared to protest the man who oppresses them. The struggle in Venezuela is the struggle between dictatorship and democracy. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolás Maduro must go. For six long years, the people of Venezuela have suffered under the heavy hand of oppression. The Maduro regime's socialist policies have shrunk their economy by nearly half. It is remarkable to think that in what was once one of the wealthiest countries in our hemisphere, that 9 out of 10 people live in poverty. The average Venezuelan has lost more than 20 pounds through deprivation and malnutrition. Thousands of Venezuelan children are starving at this very hour. And infants in hospitals across Venezuela are dying for lack of basic medical care. It's extraordinary to hear of it. As my wife and I traveled through the region on several occasions and met with refugees from Venezuela , to hear the story just broke your heart. I'll never forget in Manaus, Brazil, a father surrounded by his three small boys who looked , looked me in the eye, as his boys looked on, and said that he had finally decided to flee Venezuela because he described how hard it was, the days that he had to come home and look at his boys and say, ""We're not eating today."" And as the translator repeated those words to me, the little boys nodded their heads, remembering those days. Or the grandmother, when we were in Colombia at a little church that had taken in thousands of Venezuelan refugees, told me that she finally fled Venezuela because her grandchildren were required to get up at four in the morning to go and claim a paper ticket so they could stand in line at four in the afternoon and turn the ticket in, in exchange for a single piece of bread. She said she'd had enough. She gathered up her four grandchildren and made the long journey to the west, to the Colombia border. The impact on families, on real lives , some three million people that have fled the country , a million more by the end of the year, projected , are stories that the world needs to hear. And under Maduro's dictatorship, crime, violence, and lawlessness have also spread. We're told that thieves in Venezuela don't rob banks because with inflation at 1,000,000 percent a year, money is basically worthless. Instead, they rob restaurants for food. Vicious gangs and the notorious colectivos have turned the streets into warzones. And Venezuela now has the highest murder rate in the world. More than 70 people are murdered every single day. But the Maduro regime is not only a threat to the Venezuelan people. As we gather here today and we think of disruptions across our hemisphere, we must recognize it is also a threat to the peace and security of our region as well. The rising desperation in Venezuela has fueled a mass exodus, the likes of which we literally have never seen in the Western Hemisphere. As I said, more than 3 million Venezuelans have abandoned their beloved country. And it's estimated that millions more will follow in the days ahead. Venezuela is a failed state. And as history teaches, failed states know no boundaries. Drug traffickers, criminal gangs, terrorists groups seeking to destabilize the region and profit from the misery of the Venezuelan people every day. And while the Maduro regime has stood aside as millions of its own people have fled in desperation, it's been more than eager to accept the aid and comfort of regimes in Iran, and Russia, and Cuba. The Iranian regime has been working with Venezuela's corrupt dictatorship to establish a safe haven for its terrorist proxies, and continues to do so as we gather here. Last month, a high-level delegation from Iran's Foreign Ministry celebrated a very public launch of direct air service between Caracas and Tehran by Mahan Air, a blacklisted airline controlled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which President Trump recently designated as a terrorist organization. And one of Maduro's top aides , a former Vice President and currently the Interior Minister, Tareck El Aissami , is a drug runner and a money launderer who partners with terrorist networks to bring Iran-backed terrorists into the country. And today, Hezbollah is working to extend its dangerous network throughout Venezuela, and from there, throughout our hemisphere. And while Iranian terrorists build safe havens, despite their denials, it's clear that Russia also seeks a foothold in this hemisphere in Venezuela. Moscow is the Maduro regime's biggest weapons supplier. In exchange for bartered Venezuelan oil, Russia provides military jet fighters and acts as a lender of last resort. Last month, Russia sent two military transport planes to Caracas in a show of support for the embattled regime. But no one has done more to support the corrupt Maduro regime than the Communist leaders of Cuba. For nearly two decades, the Havana regime has sent thousands of Cuban teachers, engineers to Venezuela to prop up a failing regime. Cuban agents control the levers of power in many government agencies, especially the military and intelligence services. And as we saw last week, key decisions about Venezuela's future are as much made in Havana as they are in Caracas. Venezuela isn't merely a Cuban client, the people of Venezuela are essentially Cuba's hostage. And Cuba has robbed Venezuela of more than her freedom; she stripped her of wealth. Some estimates claim Cuba has extracted more than $35 billion in Venezuelan oil since 2005. In short, the struggling people of Venezuela aren't just the victims of one dictatorship; the people of Venezuela are the victims of two dictatorships. So this is the company that Nicolás Maduro keeps. And the Americas will never fully realize our potential as a hemisphere of freedom until Venezuela is able to cast off Cuba's control and once again take its rightful place as a free and independent nation. (Applause.) But for all of the suffering across the country in cities large and small, it is inspiring to see the Venezuelan people rising up. As President Trump said not long ago, ""the fight for freedom [in Venezuela] has [just] begun."" Four short months ago, after Nicolás Maduro was sworn into a second term stolen in a sham election, the National Assembly , the only duly elected body in Venezuela , exercised its power under the constitution and recognized a new leader: Interim President Juan Guaidó. At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela. And now more than 50 nations around the world have joined us. And all across this Western Hemisphere, nations have been standing up to declare their support for President Guaidó. Two months ago, the Inter-American Development Bank voted to seat President Guaidó's representative. Last month, the G7 foreign ministers issued a statement saying the May 2018 presidential election lacked legitimacy, and called on the Maduro regime, in their words, to, quote, ""restore the authority of the National Assembly."" And the OAS , the oldest regional organization in the world , voted to stand with the Venezuelan people and recognize Guaidó's government as the only true representative of Venezuela. As we gather here today, President Guaidó is meeting with members of the National Assembly, some of whom have come under harassment by the National Guard and intelligence services. So, let me take this opportunity to be very clear: The safety and security of President Juan Guaidó and his family are a priority for the United States of America. (Applause.) The United States has been tough , stood strong for freedom in Venezuela. And as the President has said, we can be ""a lot tougher."" Under the Maduro regime, in particular, the Supreme Court of Venezuela has undermined its constitutional mandate. The Supreme Court was established to protect individual rights and the rule of law and, sadly, of late, it has become a political tool for a regime that usurps democracy, indicts political prisoners, and promotes authoritarianism. It is time for the Supreme Court in Venezuela to return to its founding purpose. If the Supreme Court of Venezuela does not return to its constitutional mandate to uphold the rule of law, the United States of America will hold all 25 of its magistrates accountable for their actions. So, I came today to be very clear: The United States of America will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition of democracy in Venezuela. But to those who continue to oppress the good people of Venezuela, know this: All options are on the table. Nations across the world have spoken with a clear voice and the time has come for freedom-loving nations also to begin to prepare , prepare for a brighter future for the people of Venezuela after Maduro is gone. Under President Trump's leadership, I'm proud to say the United States has been standing with the people of Venezuela, and we have been committed to helping families and communities that have been devastated by the dictatorship and oppression of the Maduro regime. We've positioned more than 500 metric tons of food and humanitarian supplies on the Venezuelan border, ready for immediate distribution. The American people have provided nearly $260 million in aid to support displaced Venezuelans and the host nations that support them so generously. And today, I am announcing that, at the President's direction, the United States Navy will deploy the USNS Comfort to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America this June. (Applause.) The Comfort will embark on a 5-month humanitarian mission to address the Venezuelan crisis. The United States military and medical personnel, working alongside their counterparts across the region, will be there to provide medical assistance to communities in need and help relieve countries overwhelmed by the influx of the suffering people of Venezuela. And while the United States has sanctioned more than 150 government officials and state-owned businesses loyal to the dictator, America has also made it clear that these sanctions need not be permanent. Just as the National Assembly has promised to provide amnesty to anyone who has not committed a war crime, so too the United States of America will consider sanctions relief for all those who step forward, stand up for the constitution, and support the rule of law , like General Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the former chief of the Venezuelan intelligence service, who just last week broke ranks with the Maduro regime and rallied to the support of the Venezuelan constitution and the National Assembly. In recognition of his recent actions in support of democracy and the rule of law, I am announcing today that the United States of America is removing all sanctions on General Manuel Cristopher Figuera effective immediately. As President Guaidó builds a brighter future for Venezuela, we hope the action that our nation is taking today will encourage others to follow the example of General Cristopher Figuera and members of the military who've also stepped forward and taken a stand for the Bolivarian constitution and libertad. We believe that Venezuela will one day again be free, that democracy will be restored. And once democracy is restored, the United States and the world community will not let a free Venezuela fail. (Applause.) We will help the fledgling Venezuelan democracy regain its footing. We'll build a brighter future after Maduro is gone , creating jobs, fighting poverty, and expanding opportunity. We're already hard at work. Freedom-loving countries of the Lima Group and the G7 are helping to build support for Venezuela at institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank. Together, we will get aid to Venezuelan families and rekindle access to trade finance so Venezuelans can get goods back on the shelves, extend lines of credit for new businesses, and help the Venezuelan government meet its basic needs. Once Venezuela's democracy is restored, Venezuela's future will be bright. And let me be clear: there can be no bystanders in the cause of freedom in Venezuela , across this hemisphere or across the world. And the United States, today, again calls on all nations of the Western Hemisphere to stand with the Venezuelan people as they rise up to restore freedom, democracy, and libertad to their nation. Freedom springs from the hearts of people all over the world. But as history records, it has always sprung, in particular, from the hearts of people here in the New World. And I believe, with all my heart, that freedom will continue to ring not only across this land, but across this hemisphere , across this hemisphere of freedom. And Venezuela will one day be free. For, in the words of Simón Bolivar, ""A people that loves freedom will, in the end, be free."" So to all the people of Venezuela, on behalf of my fellow Americans, we say again: Estamos con ustedes , we're with you. We will continue to stand with you and pray with you until your freedom is restored. And to the freedom-loving people in Venezuela and all the good people gathered here and nations that are standing with them, just know: As you stand, as you march, as you go, you do not go alone. We are all with you. Freedom-loving people across this hemisphere are with you. And I also believe that the author of freedom is with you as well, ""for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" That means when we labor for freedom, we make His work on this Earth our own. And freedom always wins. So, with faith in that great promise, gratitude to all who have joined us across their hemisphere of freedom in this great cause, and faith in the courage and strength of the Venezuelan people and the generosity and ideals of the American people and all our allies, I believe with all my heart the day is coming soon when Venezuela will once more be free. We will see ""a new birth of freedom"" in this nation in our hemisphere. And Venezuela will be a nation reborn to libertad, so help us God. (Applause.) Thank you very much. God bless you all. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1341893/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-washington-conference-on-the-americas&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-washington-conference-americas/
VSMP85201984	Mike Pence	2019-05-08	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Federalist Society's Seventh Annual Executive Branch Review Conference	speech	"Well, thank you all for that very warm welcome. And thank you to Leonard Leo not only for that overly generous introduction, but I want to thank Leonard for his tireless work over the last few years. Our administration and the nation owe you a debt of gratitude. Would you all join me in thanking Leonard Leo , (applause) , the Vice President of the Federalist Society, for all he's done for America? To Gene Meyer, to Dean Reuter, and distinguished guests: It really is an honor to join so many , so many of you who are part of this remarkable organization with an extraordinary history that's impacting the life of the law and the life of our nation each and every day. Thank you for inviting us to the Federalist Society's Seventh Annual Executive Branch Review Conference. It's an honor to be with all of you. And I want to welcome some of you back to Washington, D.C. Though many of you work here, I always think of what President Kennedy said in describing our nation's capital , those of you that are just visiting. He said Washington, D.C. is a place that combines southern efficiency with northern charm. (Laughter.) But I expect you have found this to be an enormously important day, hearing from key members, general counsels of administration branches, as well as the Chief of Staff of the White House earlier today. And, mentioning people in our administration, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a great admirer of the Federalist Society and a tireless defender of the Constitution of the United States of America. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President is on Air Force One as we speak. He's headed out to Florida and will be at a rally a little bit later today. But I did mention to him at our Cabinet meeting earlier today that I was speaking to members of the Federalist Society, and he was very excited about that. (Laughter.) He's a great admirer of all of you. And I expect , and I'll reflect a bit on the record of the last two and a half years. It's obvious how much we admire the men and women of the Federalist Society. You know, it's amazing to think the Federalist Society was founded nearly 40 years ago by a handful of law students who felt alienated by the dominance of liberalism on their campuses, and they simply wanted to take a stand for ""the principles of limited government embodied in our Constitution"" and give them a fair hearing in the courts and in the law. In fact, when I was elected to Congress, back in the year 2000, I actually followed in the Congress one of the founders of the Federalist Society. He is a great Hoosier. He's a source of great pride. Would you join me in welcoming one of the founders of the Federalist Society 40 years ago? The honorable David McIntosh is with us here today. (Applause.) Great job, David. Go ahead, stand up. Well, from those backbench law students complaining four decades ago, since then, it's remarkable to think what the Federalist Society has done. You fought to reorient the American legal system toward its original principles: ""that the state exists to preserve freedom [and] that the separation of government powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be."" (Applause.) The Federalist Society has stood on constitutional principle. And, really, you've achieved incredible success. The Federalist Society, I'm told, actually helps educate more than 10,000 students at every accredited law school in America. Your Lawyers Division includes more than 65,000 legal professionals across the country. It's truly remarkable. And today, your members serve in positions all across the federal government, serving in the United States Congress, in district courts and courts of appeals. And five of the nine justices of the Supreme Court of the United States are or have been members of the Federalist Society. (Applause.) What began as a small group scattered throughout a few law schools has become a powerful movement grounded in the principles of the American founding, leading the fight for constitutional principles that always made America great before and are making America great again. And I promise you, you have no greater friend in that fight than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, and make no mistake about it: The President and I both know the American people have stood with him, and in large part because he's a man of his word and he kept his promises to cut taxes, roll back regulations, and rebuild our military. And this President has kept his promise to nominate strong conservatives to our federal courts at every level. (Applause.) True. I mean, we all remember that morning in February of 2016 when news broke of the passing of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. He was a lion of the law who, nearly four decades ago, actually helped found the Federalist Society. In 1986, my second favorite President, Ronald Reagan , (laughter) , appointed him to serve on the Supreme Court, where he wrote hundreds of opinions, building the case for a renewed focus on what the Constitution actually says and not just what judges might like it to say. Before Justice Scalia, this approach wasn't popular. In fact, he once claimed, in his words, that, quote, ""This is such a minority position that on occasion I'm asked, ""Justice Scalia, when did you first become an originalist?' , as though it [was] some kind of weird affliction that seizes people."" (Laughter.) But today, Justice Scalia's legal reasoning is alive and well, and the men and women here at the Federalist Society are proof that the legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia lives on in the law in this nation. (Applause.) And President Trump understood , in his time as a candidate, in his time in private life, and time as a President , the role that Justice Scalia has played in our nation's highest court. And the President made history when, with your help, he released several lists of distinguished men and women that he promised to choose to fill who would , who would represent the legacy and fill the seat of the late, great Justice Scalia. And since Election Day, I'm pleased to report we didn't just fill that seat. This President has actually appointed more than 100 men and women to our federal courts, including more circuit court judges than any President in American history. And they are all conservatives , (applause) , who are committed to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. And that doesn't even count the two judges that this President chose for the Supreme Court of the United States. I've gotten to know both of them. I had the great privilege of participating in the process where the President was interviewing finalists and candidates. But the two men that he appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States are extraordinary conservatives who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined our Constitution. America and our Constitution are better today with Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the highest court in the land. (Applause.) So we've made great progress, but we're going to keep right on working. Earlier today, the United States, I'm pleased to report, confirmed another one of President Trump's nominees to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Joseph Bianco is the 103rd federal judge confirmed to the bench, and he's a member of the Federalist Society. (Applause.) So, the Federalist Society is making a difference for our Constitution and our nation. And I couldn't be more proud to be with all of you today. But we're here today, I know, to discuss the focus of this year's Executive Branch Conference: regulatory reform. In the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote that the , and I quote , ""accumulation of all powers, legislative [and] executive and judicial [is] the very definition of tyranny."" As we've seen all too often, federal agencies in the modern era frequently have exerted just that type of control. But I'm proud to say, under President Trump's leadership, we have taken decisive action, and the days of excessive regulations from Washington, D.C. are coming to an end. (Applause.) In fact, I'm pleased to report we've cut more federal red tape in our first two years than any administration in American history. We exceeded a goal that we set at the very beginning of our administration. In fact, when he was a candidate, the President promised the American people that we would repeal two federal regulations for every new federal rule put in the Code of Federal Regulations. But we didn't do that. We actually, as of last year, have cut 12 federal regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. (Applause.) We're rolling back red tape at a historic level, and it's made a real difference in our economy. As you've heard here today, and you all have reflected on, you know that has real impact on jobs and opportunities. Since Election Day, our administration has actually delivered, by most estimates, about $33 billion in regulatory savings for businesses large and small all across America. And that's meant higher wages. It's meant more jobs and more opportunities for Americans. And the truth is, as you look at the agenda of this administration , of historic tax relief, unleashing American energy, and fighting for more free and fair and reciprocal trade , it's been the regulatory relief that actually has been a capstone of all of that. As I travel around the country, I hear , I hear business leaders tell me every single day that while the tax cuts made a difference, the regulatory relief made just as much a difference. And because of the leadership that the President has provided, and the support that we had from Republican majorities, the American economy is booming. (Applause.) It's true. Since Election Day, businesses large and small have created 5.8 million new jobs. Just last week, we announced more than 260,000 jobs were created in the month of April alone, exceeding expectations by all the experts and extending the longest streak of consecutive months of job growth ever. The unemployment rate, as of last Friday, hit a nearly 50-year low, and today there are more Americans working than ever before in the history of the United States. (Applause.) In fact, I was just in a Cabinet meeting and I heard a statistic confirmed that, for the 13th straight month, there are more job openings today than there are Americans looking for work. It's remarkable. It's the longest streak in American history. But also, it had actually never happened before since those labor statistics were accumulated. I mean, it wouldn't come as any surprise to members of the Federalist Society that when you let people keep more of what they earn, when you lift the heavy hand of government off of free enterprise, when you make efforts for better and fairer trade and exchange on an international basis, and you lower the cost of energy, you take three steps back and Americans know what to do with freedom, they create prosperity like the world has never seen before. (Applause.) True. But for all that we've accomplished with the support of all of you in this room, that's just what President Trump likes to call a good start. It's true. Because we understand that slashing red tape, rolling back the heavy hand of the administrative state, is about more than just economic growth. President Trump's agenda is simple. It's about freedom. The freedom to live, to work, to start a business, to worship, to live out your life according to the dictates of your conscience. It's the American agenda. That's why, since day one, this President has fought to defend the freedom of the American people from, in his words, ""government coercion, domination, and control."" We stopped the last administration's effort to force employers to provide health insurance plans that violated their pro-life principles, and we expanded and strengthened a religious and moral exemption to the HHS mandate so all Americans can live out their faith in freedom without fear. (Applause.) Working with the Department of Labor, we've taken action to make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance to their employees through association health plans. Another example: The VA has removed unnecessary regulations to expand veterans' access to telehealth services so that those who have served in the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States can get the real-time, world-class healthcare they deserve. The EPA , (applause) , thank you. You can applaud those fine men and women. They deserve it. (Applause.) The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers are working to undo the damage of the last administration's ""Waters of the USA."" It was a rule that literally had farmers and homeowners all across the country concerned about the loss of basic private property rights. And we're , we're cutting the federal red tape that slows down the deployment of new technologies like the 5G wireless networks. We've had remarkable success rolling back the heavy hand of government, and the Federalist Society has been with us every step of the way. And the President and I are truly grateful for your steadfast support. Unfortunately, as you've no doubt reflected on today, the kind of government control that our Founders were concerned about is too often exerted by the administrative state in this country. And it's been emerging in recent years in the federal judiciary in the form of nationwide injunctions. These orders are issued by federal district court judges on a broad range of issues , from national security to immigration, from border security to healthcare reform. And these orders prevent the entire Executive Branch from enforcing a statute, a regulation, or a policy on a nationwide basis. And they apply everywhere, to everyone, granting relief even to those who are not parties to a case. As Justice Thomas wrote last year in a decision upholding President Trump's ability to enforce our immigration laws against nationwide injunctions, Justice Thomas said nationwide injunctions, in his words, ""take a toll on the federal court system , preventing legal questions from percolating [and] encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and the Executive Branch."" It's remarkable to think a Supreme Court justice has to convince four of their colleagues to uphold a nationwide injunction, but a single district court judge can issue one, effectively preventing the duly elected President of the United States from fulfilling what he believes is a constitutional duty. This obstruction at the district level is unprecedented. Studies show that there's not a single example of a nationwide injunction in the first 175 years of our nation's history. Although we received some good news last night that the Ninth Circuit stayed an injunction to allow our administration to continue our ""remain in Mexico"" policy, addressing the crisis at our southern border, the truth is, our administration has been unfairly hit with more nationwide injunctions than the first 40 American presidents combined. Nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges prevent the Executive Branch from acting, compromising our national security by obstructing the lawful ability of the President to stop threats to the homeland, where he sees them. These injunctions undermine the rule of law and the separation of powers that are central to our nation's founding, that lie at the very heart of our Constitution. And so I say to all those gathered here, for the sake of our liberty, our security, our prosperity, and the separation of powers: This era of judicial activism must come to an end. (Applause.) The Supreme Court of the United States must clarify that district judges can decide no more than the cases before them. And it's imperative that we restore the historic tradition that district judges do not set policy for the whole nation. In the days ahead, our administration will seek opportunities to put this very question before the Supreme Court to ensure that decisions affecting every American are made either by those elected to represent the American people or by the highest court in the land. (Applause.) So thank you again for allowing me to join you here today in this remarkable time in the life of our nation. And thank you for the role that all the members of the Federalist Society have played in the progress that we're making , the progress we're making in this economy, the progress we're making in our courts, and the progress that we're making as we rebuild our military and make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And the truth of the matter is, we're advancing an agenda of freedom for the American people. And the Federalist Society has played a critical role in advancing that agenda. But just know we're just getting started. We're going to continue to lean on each and every one of you, guided by your example and as you are guided by the wisdom of our Founders to continue, to make this country great and strong and prosperous as it was always intended to be. But we can't keep winning if we don't keep fighting. But the truth is, we live in a time when freedom itself, in so many ways, is under assault. Today, leading liberals mock the First Amendment freedoms of millions of Americans across the country. They reject the right to life, many arguing for late-term abortion and even some defending infanticide. Under the guise of what's known as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, liberals are fighting for more regulation and government control of our daily lives. And increasingly, every day, we see Democrats at the national level and around the country advocate a failed economic system that impoverished hundreds of millions around the world and robbed the liberty of generations. I truly do believe that the choice before us has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. It really is a choice between government coercion and control and a socialist vision for America, and freedom and free markets and the principles of limited government. It's really a choice between freedom and socialism. And it's important that the leaders gathered here, as you return to your homes, return to your practices and your work , you help tell the story not just of what we've accomplished, but of the choice our country faces in the days ahead, and that you do what Federalist Society members have always done, and that is talk about the principles that have made this country great. You know, it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous economy in the history of the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. It was freedom, not socialism, that's moving us beyond the prejudices of the past to create a more perfect union and extend the blessings of liberty to every American, regardless of race or creed or color. And it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the highest quality of life, the cleanest environment on Earth, and improved the health and wellbeing of millions around the world. You know, what Medicare for All really means is quality healthcare for none. (Laughter.) And the only thing green about the Green New Deal is how much green it's going to cost all of us if they ever sign it into law. (Laughter.) Margaret Thatcher probably said it best: ""The trouble with Socialism is [you] eventually run out of other people's money."" (Laughter.) You know, I say to you from my heart: The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America. And so, as President Trump said in his State of the Union Address, so we must say from this day and every day forward: ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) Well, this is our charge; this is our challenge: to reject the Left's plans for more government and more government control, and continue fighting , continue fighting for the agenda that President Trump brought to the White House, that Republican majorities have stood shoulder to shoulder with him on, and all of you have stood in partnership with us: a pro-growth, pro-freedom agenda. And we know it won't be easy. But Thomas Paine wrote, eloquently, and I quote, ""The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly."" And then he went on to say these words that I find myself reflecting on often. Thomas Paine said, ""Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated."" And I want to promise you President Trump and I are ready for the fight. (Applause.) And we're ready to stand with you, to stand and fight for freedom. We'll fight alongside the Federalist Society to keep on building, keep on growing, and keep on strengthening America. We can't do it alone. So, as I said, I want you to do your part. Talk to your colleagues and your friends , not just Federalist Society lawyers, but all your colleagues. Talk to your clients , people leading businesses large and small , about how far we have come as a country in just two and half short years and how far we can go if we continue to strengthen the foundation underneath this nation with courts that are committed to a strict constructionist philosophy and fealty to the Constitution. Tell them that this President and this administration are fighting for all of the liberties they hold dear. And, in a word, do just like those words on the Liberty Bell say. I was very moved, Leonard, when you mentioned my visit to the Liberty Bell because it was already in the speech. (Laughter.) I'll never forget, I walked up to that Liberty Bell in Philadelphia when I was at that Federalist Society then. And I did look for those ancient words that were inscribed around it. It's where the Liberty Bell gets its name. ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land [and] unto all the inhabitants thereof."" That was a charge to early Americans, and it's a charge for each and every one of us. President Reagan said, memorably, ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" So we got to go tell the story. It's not going to be enough for us just to win the next election; we have to win the next generation. (Applause.) And we win it by explaining the principles of our nation's founding, explaining the genius of our Founders, and letting this generation know that those ideals all still work and they're witnessing them being put into practice again in our courts, in our economy, and our nation. But it's been great to be with all of you today. I know you've had a long day, and I appreciate the invitation to join you. But I want to tell you, looking out at all of you, I leave here today with renewed confidence that with your continued support, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with conservatives in our courts at every level all across this nation, with the support of the American people behind the ideals that we hold dear, and with God's help, we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. We will strengthen the foundations upon which this nation was built as never before. And to borrow a phrase , (laughter) , we will make America great again. Thanks everybody. (Applause.) God bless you all. And God bless America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1341895/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-federalist-societys-seventh-annual-executive-branch-review-conference&speechType=1	Constitution Judicial Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-federalist-societys-seventh-annual-executive-branch-review-conference/
VSMP155201983	Mike Pence	2019-05-15	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Memorial Service for Senator Richard Lugar	speech	"Governor Holcomb, Chief Justice Roberts, Leader McConnell, Senator Leahy, Senator Nunn, Governor Daniels, distinguished members of the Senate and the House, members of the clergy, friends of this precious family, my fellow Hoosiers , and, most of all, to Char, Mark, Bob, John, David, and to the entire Lugar family: It is deeply humbling to have the privilege to be here, among so many distinguished Americans , so many who knew and loved this great man , to celebrate and to give thanks for a life of service. The Bible tells us to mourn with those who mourn and to grieve with those who grieve. And on behalf of a grateful nation, Karen and I offer our deepest sympathies , Char, to you, and to your entire family , and to all who cherished and knew this husband, father, mayor, senator, and true American statesman: Richard G. Lugar. Richard Lugar lived a great American life. He raised a wonderful family. He served his country in uniform. He was a dedicated public servant who led this city, this state, and this nation with integrity for more than 50 years. The Old Book admonishes us to ""run with perseverance the race marked out for us."" And for those who knew him well, they knew Dick Lugar never stopped running. Born in 1932 to Marvin and Bertha Lugar here in Indianapolis, he was a standout student. Eagle Scout. First in his class at Shortridge High. First at Denison University. A Rhodes Scholar. While he was studying overseas in London, he ran right into the American embassy and enlisted into the United States Navy. After he came home, he kept running. He helped run a machine business for his family. He ran for the Indianapolis school board. And before long, he was running this city. You know, we all remember the Indianapolis that elected Dick Lugar mayor, back in 1967. It was a good place, but it was a very different place. Affectionately known as ""Indiananoplace."" But Dick Lugar changed all that. He adopted reforms like Unigov that literally transformed our capital city into the most , one of the most dynamic capital cities in America. Perhaps the greatest monument to Dick's leadership here in Indiana is the skyline of Indianapolis , that world-class city that he leaves behind. For many, that legacy of transformational leadership would have been enough , but not for Dick Lugar. No sooner had he set into motion the reforms that would transform this city, he was off to another race. And in 1974, he took on a long-shot race for the United States Senate against Senator Birch Bayh, a rising star in national politics and his party. You know, it's remarkable to think that two giants of 20th century Indiana politics departed this world within a few weeks of each other. It's the end of an era. And on this day, I know Dick wouldn't mind if we took a moment to express our gratitude and condolences to the Bayh family, as they grieve the loss of another great Indiana public servant. Now, while he came up short in that race, Dick Lugar kept running. And in 1976, he won. And over his 36 years in the Senate, Senator Richard Lugar became the longest-serving senator in the history of the state, was a candidate for President of the United States. But he'll be remembered among a pantheon of senators who commanded the respect of his peers in both parties and who exercised enormous influence in foreign affairs. He was a working senator; he always put Indiana first. As those of us who served in Congress at the same time knew, his work on the Agriculture Committee always put Hoosier farmers first. For his years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar emerged as an American statesman whose contributions to our nation are countless. As you've heard, described by his partner in this legislation, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Senator Lugar crafted a measure that led to the historic elimination of more than 7,500 nuclear warheads, leaving the world safer as a result. He also was a clarion voice for American leadership in the world. Senator Dick Lugar understood that , as he said, that American was a powerful nation, but more importantly, we were a heroic nation. And that we had, as he said, a moral responsibility to foster the concepts of opportunity, free enterprise, the rule of law, and democracy. He would call it the ""hope of the world."" As I traveled around the world as a congressman and a senator, I was always struck by the fact , no matter what capital, anywhere in the world I was , as soon as I told people I was I was from Indiana, the next two words I heard were ""Dick Lugar."" And they were always spoken with a smile. But the truth is, Senator Lugar commanded the admiration of our allies and the respect of our enemies like very few Americans ever had. And for his many contributions to this country, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. And long after he left the Senate, he continued to be called on by world leaders for his wisdom and his counsel. In fact, just last year, President Trump welcomed Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn to the Oval Office to seek their counsel before he departed for his first historic summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. But Senator Lugar's legacy goes well beyond the policies that he championed and the national and international reputation that he earned and so well deserved. It included a generation of leaders that he inspired. I mean, the truth is, Dick Lugar had an eye for talent. You've already heard one example of that from this podium today, but you should also know he hired an industrious young staffer who eventually became his Chief of Staff, Governor of Indiana, and, now, Mitch Daniels is President of Purdue University. And when he was Chairman of the Senatorial Committee in 1984, he took a chance on a first-time candidate for the United States Senate by the name of Mitch McConnell. And for our part, Karen and I will always be grateful for his encouragement all along our way. Thirty years ago, when we were just getting started , a nervous young couple in politics , in was the senior Senator from Indiana who went door to door with us in Wayne County. And every time we ran the Capital Challenge, he was always there at the finish line , (laughter) , to shake our hand. (Laughter.) Never stopped running. You know, running wasn't just how Dick Lugar kept in shape, it was a way of life. I think his running was emblematic of his passion for public service and his relentless drive to make a difference in the life of this nation. There's a Boy Scout rule that says you don't leave a campsite as good as you found it; you leave it better than you found it. And Dick Lugar left Indiana, America, and the world better than he found it: more secure, more at peace, with freedom on the rise. Few Hoosiers will ever leave as large or indelible a mark on our state or our nation as Richard Lugar. And yet it was who he was that made him so special. His intellect and backbone were paired with a modesty and kindness not always associated with politics. He was a man utterly without guile and without pretense. And for all his accomplishments in public life, it didn't take you too long to figure out what he thought his greatest accomplishment was. It was this wonderful family: his children, his grandchildren, and his marriage to that incredible co-president of the senior class at Denison University. Dick and Char were a team every day of their lives. And, Char, I want to thank you for sharing this great man with our state and nation. When Char gave us the honor of participating today, she told us that she didn't want to hold this service in a sports stadium, though they could have filled one anywhere in Indiana. They wanted to hold it here at St. Luke's , a church that Dick's family helped found generations ago. Because, as Char told us that night on the phone, ""That's who we are."" And throughout his life, that's who Dick Lugar was: all about family and faith. I came across a story about that in a book published in 1988. Years ago, there was a high-school journalism convention, and two young writers from The Shortridge Daily Echo were rooming together at the convention. And as they were turning in for the evening, a young Dick Lugar turned to his roommate and asked if he'd like to join him in prayer. Years later, that roommate recounted that it was the first time in his life that anyone other than a minister had asked him to pray out loud. And he was taken aback; he rejected the offer with a quick, ""No, thanks."" And then, to hide his discomfort, he put the pillow over his head. But as he laid there, years later he would recount that he heard Dick recite, and I quote, ""in a clear unaffected voice"" the words of the Lord's Prayer. And then to ""go on to express his love and concern for his family and friends, asking God's blessing [on] them."" His roommate said, years later, quote, ""There was nothing bizarre or histrionic about my friend's prayer, yet it both awed and unnerved me, leaving an impression that lasted"" for the rest of his life. That's who Dick Lugar was. And that's how he will always be remembered by those of us who had the privilege to know him: a man who loved his family, loved his friend, loves this state, and loved this country like few people I've ever known. And it all came from a heart of concern for what was best for all. So Dick Lugar never stopped running throughout his long and industrious life. And that was good for us. But on this day, it can rightly be said that he fought the good fight, he finished the race, and he kept the faith. And Indiana and America and the world are better for it. May God bless the memory of Richard G. Lugar. May God comfort his family and friends and all who mourn the passing of this truly great man. And may God continue to bless the land he loved."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1343525/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-memorial-service-for-senator-richard-lugar&speechType=1	Arts, Entertainment, and History		Indianapolis, IN	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-memorial-service-senator-richard-lugar-indianapolis-indiana/
VSMP155201982	Mike Pence	2019-05-15	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Premiere Screening of Apollo 11: First Steps Edition	speech	"Well, thank you, Jim Bridenstine. Thank you for that kind introduction. And more to the point, thank you for your tireless work leading NASA and the entire American space industry. Would you all join me in thanking the 13th Administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, for the great job he's doing? (Applause.) To Secretary Wilbur Ross, Chairman Moran, Senator Cramer, Congressman Lucas, Congresswoman Horn, Congressman Babin and members of the House Science Committee , to all the members of Congress who are with us here today, thank you for supporting a renewed American leadership in space. Join me in thanking all these great members of the House and Senate. (Applause.) And to all of you leaders in industry, the archivists , all of you that have made this evening possible , especially the extraordinary filmmakers who I know we'll see their handiwork in just a few minutes , it really is an honor to be here today. The world premiere of Apollo 11: First Steps Edition. Welcome all. It is great to be with you. (Applause.) And let me say, as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to securing American leadership on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space, whose vision has enlivened America's commitment to human space exploration. I bring greetings and gratitude to all of you from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I always wait to introduce the highest-ranking official last. So join me in welcoming an aviator, an educator, a Marine Corps mom, and my wife of 33 years , the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence. (Applause.) You know, Karen and I are , we're pretty passionate about space. In fact, when our kids were very young , and they're all in their twenties right now; one is in the military, two are still in graduate school , we actually , we actually vacationed at Cape Canaveral, just so we could take the kids to see the rockets. So we're honored to be with all of you today in this incredible and historic place. Speaking of which, allow me to thank our host tonight. You already heard from her, but Dr. Ellen Stofan and all the wonderful, dedicated men and women at the National Air and Space Museum. This is the most popular museum in the United States and one of the most popular museums in the world. Thank you, Dr. Stofan. Thank you for your great leadership and stewardship of this national treasure. (Applause.) It really is amazing to be here, standing here before you , the ""Spirit of St. Louis"" just above us, that made that transatlantic flight. And then there's ""Glamorous Glennis"" just above us, that broke the sound barrier. And then this lunar module behind me. It's amazing to think, just in my lifetime, how far America has come. And here at this great museum, we preserve that legacy. But as I just told Dr. Stofan, thanks to President Trump's leadership, they're going to have to build a new wing because we're going to make all new American history in the vast expanse of space. (Applause.) Not that it should be a surprise. In his Inaugural Address to the nation two years ago, President Trump said that America stands, in his words, ""at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space."" What the President recognized, what you all recognize is America has always been a nation of restless pioneers , ever striving to explore uncharted territories, reach new horizons, venture into the unknown, and expand the boundaries of human knowledge. But it was in 1961 when another President, John F. Kennedy, laid out a vision for American human space exploration. He expressed those immortal words, laying forth a goal for the nation, that, quote, ""before this decade is out landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth."" It was anything but easy. Literally hundreds of thousands of engineers, scientists, technicians worked around the clock to make it possible , planning each detail and preparing every possibility. And just 8 years later , 50 years ago this July , Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins made it happen and proved that the United States can do anything we put our mind to, when we put the first man on the moon. (Applause.) And tonight, we're going to see some never-before-seen footage of those incredible moments , and I can't wait , including when that ""one small step"" for a man became ""one giant leap for mankind."" The crew of Apollo 11 inspired a generation of Americans and people all over the world. They are giants on whose shoulders we stand , paving our way into the heavens and giving us the courage to dream bigger, to go farther, with the confidence that we can accomplish whatever we set our minds to. So as we prepare to mark this golden anniversary of their mission later this year, we honor their legacy , the legacy of Apollo 11 , by celebrating it in moments like this. And there will be many celebrations over the course of the year. But I submit to you that we believe we also honor their legacy by renewing our commitment to American leadership in space. (Applause.) As President Trump said, ""It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown."" And over the past two years, I'm pleased to report to you that we've begun writing the next chapter of that adventure with ingenuity and incredible Americans all across this nation. In our first year, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, I'm proud to say that President Trump kept his word to the American people back in 2016, and he revived the National Space Council to coordinate all space activities across a whole-of-government approach. And it's my great honor to serve as Chairman, as previous Vice Presidents have done. We also looked beyond the halls of government for input and guidance, partnering with businesses represented here so well to accelerate innovation across the space enterprise. And we're honored to be joined this evening by several members of what we call our ""User Advisory Group."" We thought it was imperative that we brought together the best and brightest men and women in the nation with expertise in the space enterprise. And these men and women have gathered from some of the most incredible companies in this country to bring their expertise. And they join us here today , members of the User Advisory Group. Would you join me in giving a round of applause for all the members of the UAG? (Applause.) I got Dr. Mary Lynne Dittmar, the President of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration; Dr. Bud Peterson, the President of Georgia Institute of Technology; and Eric Stallmer, the President of Commercial Space Federation; and Mandy Vox [Vaughn], President of VOX Space. Give them all a round of applause because they're helping to guide renewed American leadership in space. (Applause.) And while we're at it, I couldn't help , I couldn't help but take the opportunity to invite you to recognize some extraordinary people who are with us today. One was a veteran , one was a veteran of three different space shuttle missions. She's now the Director of the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Join me in welcoming Astronaut Janet Kavandi, who is with us today. Janet, thank you. (Applause.) We're also joined by a member of that User Advisory Group, who is currently serving as the Director of Space and Technology at Nova Systems. Was the commander of Space Shuttle flights STS-120. Colonel Pamela Melroy, where are you? Astronaut and Colonel Pamela Melroy. (Applause.) And finally, let me recognize a member of the crew of the final mission of the Space Shuttle. She's spent more than 144 days in orbit, and she is an incredible testament to the American Astronaut Corps. Astronaut Sandy Magnus is with us here today. Sandy, thank you. (Applause.) I've got to tell you the progress we've made. In December of 2017, as a result of the work of the National Space Council, President Trump signed Space Policy Directive-1, where we made it the policy of the United States of America to return to the moon with the goal of one day putting Americans on Mars. (Applause.) And I'm proud to report we're on track. This year, the United States will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. (Applause.) Just two months ago, during a meeting of the National Space Council down at ""Rocket City,"" in Huntsville, Alabama, it was also my privilege to announce what Jim Bridenstine just reflected on: that, at President Trump's direction, it is the policy of the United States that we will return to the moon within the next five years, and the first woman and the next man on the moon will be an American. (Applause.) So we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold new vision for American leadership in space , to push us farther and faster and higher than ever before. And unlike in years past, we have the budgets to match. As Administrator Bridenstine just said, we just sent to Capitol Hill a budget request to put , would put real substance behind the President's vision. And I want to thank these members of Congress for their stalwart support. Well, as I started to come up here, Karen and I were chatting, and she reminded me that you all didn't come here to hear me; you came here to see a movie. (Laughter.) So I want to get out of your way and let you enjoy that. But it's impossible to come to a moment like this, an evening like this, and not be incredibly inspired. And I want to thank the National Air and Space Museum again for your hospitality. I want to thank Administrator Bridenstine for the great work he's doing at NASA. And I want to thank all of you for the enthusiasm that all of you are showing. Everywhere I go in this country, people are getting it again. People understand that America has made great history leading human exploration in space. But with your support, with President Trump's leadership, with the strong support of these outstanding members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, with the courage of a new generation of astronauts, and with God's help, I know America will once again astound the world with how we lead in space. So thank you very much. God bless you. And enjoy the movie. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1343555/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-premiere-screening-of-apollo-11-first-steps-edition&speechType=1	Science Arts, Entertainment, and History		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-premiere-screening-apollo-11-first-steps-edition/
VSMP165201981	Mike Pence	2019-05-16	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Service Members	speech	"Well, thank you for that warm welcome. To the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army White, Major General Daniels, Brigadier General Iacovelli, Sergeant Major Farmer, and most importantly to all of the incredible men and women who serve in the Armed Forces of the United States of America: It is an honor to be here at Fort McCoy , the ""Total Force Training Center."" (Applause.) But as I get started, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine , from your Commander-in-Chief and a tireless champion for all of you who wear the Armed Forces of the United States. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We're proud of you all. The President wanted me to be here today to make sure you all knew how much we appreciate the work you do here at Fort McCoy and the way that you make sure that our military are ready. The efforts that you provide here each and every day , through the generations, you've provided , here at Fort McCoy have made America safer. And we're grateful and we're proud. You know, the Old Book says that ""If you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect."" And I stand before you today, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief and a grateful nation, to pay a debt of honor and a debt of respect to each and every one of you. You stood up, you stepped forward to protect our families, our freedom, and our way of life. You put on the uniform of the greatest all-volunteer military the world has ever seen. You stepped forward, Army, and said ""This We'll Defend."" (Applause.) You have our thanks. You have our thanks and you have the admiration of the American people. But the President and I also know that none of you really serve your nation alone , that behind you are loved ones. They give you the strength to do your duty and stand alongside you. So, if you don't mind, would you all help me in thanking the spouses, the moms, the dads, the kids who stand behind our heroes here at Fort McCoy? We're proud of all of you, too. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, the Armed Forces of the United States are the world's greatest force for good. And you chose to be a part of that , to follow in the footsteps of our nation's greatest heroes. You chose to do your part, in our time, and leave a legacy of freedom for generations to come. While you come from the rest of us, you're the best of us. And you are Army Strong. (Applause.) You know, it's an honor for me to be with all of you today. It's amazing to think that, for more than a century, Fort McCoy has been at the very center of America's national security. This base trained artillery units in World War I; it hosted the historic Second Army Maneuvers during World War II, preparing tens of thousands of soldiers for deployment overseas; and for 35 years, Fort McCoy has trained more than 100,000 military personnel every single year from every branch of the service, faithfully executing your mission to ""Underpin Total Force Readiness."" In fact, some of the 150,000 members of the United States military came to Fort McCoy in the last year alone, preparing themselves for deployment at a moment's notice to go anywhere in the world in defense of freedom. So to all the men and women who train here, who work here at Fort McCoy; to all the civilian support, let me assure you that your Commander-in-Chief and I, and the American people, know that the work you do here is vitally important , vitally important to our national security. And your work here does not go unnoticed. In fact, I learned on the way here that you've received some awards, which ought to be reflected on. We're standing here today in Equipment Concentration Site , I guess, 67(G). This site stores and maintains more than 16,500 pieces of equipment for 353 different units worldwide. And because of your incredible work and the work that you've done to ensure that this equipment is ready to defend freedom anywhere at any time, I was proud to learn that you earned the Army Award for Maintenance Excellence. Congratulations, Fort McCoy. Well done. Well done. (Applause.) And while the 88th Readiness Division is headquartered here at Fort McCoy, it provides leadership to nearly 600 facilities across 19 states, coordinates 4 U.S. Army Bands, and helps manage 14 local training areas through the region, giving soldiers the chance to train and prepare closer to their homes. So, really, it should come as no surprise that that work was recognized as well, when you were chosen as the United States Army's 2018 Gold Winner, which means the 88th Readiness Division is the best performing Readiness Division in the entire United States Army. Congratulations. (Applause.) And President Trump and I understand that our nation's security depends on all of you and that the foundation of American military might is the courage, the tenacity, the professionalism, and the selflessness of our armed forces. You know, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. (Applause.) You know, after we saw recent years where military budgets were depleted through constant budget cuts , and you saw the impact here at Fort McCoy of what those cuts meant in terms of readiness, in terms of keeping that equipment prepared to deploy at any time , I'm proud to report to all of you: Over the last two years, President Trump has taken decisive action to rebuild our military. We're restoring the arsenal of democracy with the largest increases in our military defense in more than a generation. (Applause.) It's true. And we're grateful for the strong bipartisan support that we've had in the Congress to support our efforts to stand by all of you and give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support you need to accomplish your mission. I'm also proud to that that all included the largest pay increase for our armed forces in more than 10 years. (Applause.) Well deserved. Every penny. In fact, just a few months ago, your Commander-in-Chief proposed the largest defense budget in American history. It's about $750 billion to ensure that the strongest fighting force in the history of the world becomes stronger still. And this proposal funds an end strength, you'll be glad to know, of more 2 million active and reserved military personnel. We'll be providing resources for 12 battle force ships, 2 large unmanned surface ships, and 110 fighter aircraft. And we're going modernize two armored brigade combat teams. And you can know with confidence, this President, this Vice President, and this administration will always fight for the men and women who fight for us. I promise you that. (Applause.) We're going to work through that budget process, but I promise you: The support of the American people, the support of their elected representatives, I know, is going to do the right thing again just as they have over the last two years. With that renewed American strength, I'm proud to report that, with the courage of our armed forces, the United States is once again embracing our role as leader of the free world. We're standing with our allies and we're standing up to our enemies. Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before. And we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists, on our terms, on their soil. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces, two months ago, the last inch controlled by the Islamic State in Syria was liberated. The territory of the ISIS caliphate is no more. (Applause.) Incredible. Incredible to think of what the soldiers and all the military personnel that you helped train, you helped prepare here accomplished. It's amazing to think of where ISIS was just a few short years ago. It had overrun vast areas of Syria and Iraq. In Iraq, it was areas that had been purchased at great sacrifice by the men and women of our armed forces. And now it's all brought back. It's all taken back. And the ISIS flag no longer flies over any ISIS territory in Iraq or Syria because of our armed forces and how you prepared them. Give yourselves another round of applause. (Applause.) Amazing. But in this time of widening challenges around the world and unknowable threats, I know you know to be ready. I know all of you know that the ""soldier does not bear the sword in vain,"" for the work you do here has never been more important. As we increase our support for our military, it's a reflection of the need for America to be strong , stronger than ever before. Because we know the best way to peace is through strength. And you are our strength. (Applause.) So I want to urge you , I want to urge you here at Fort McCoy: Be vigilant. Mind your mission. Take care of one another. Look after one another. Respect the unified chain of command. And keep executing your mission here with the extraordinary professionalism that's been celebrated in all the ways that we just recounted. And as you do all of that, just know the American people are counting on you. They're counting on you here to contribute to the readiness of our fighting forces, and that the work you do here, while not down range, is just as important as anything on any frontline anywhere in the world. You know, it's very humbling to stand before you today, because while I am the son of an Army combat veteran from the Korean War , my dad was a lieutenant who saw combat , (applause) , and I'm the proud father of a United States Marine , (applause) , the truth is, my life never took me into the uniform of the United States. So I always feel very humbled every time I'm around men and women like all of you. Because I know that your service does not come without sacrifice. And the truth is, you made a decision to count the lives of the American people as more important than your life when you step forward to put on the uniform of the United States. Your family has made the sacrifice as you serve our nation in uniform. But I wanted to come by today just to make sure you knew how grateful we all are for what you do every day, and also assure you that, here at Fort McCoy, that while we know that those of you who serve in uniform make sacrifices and bear a burden, you do not bear that burden alone. I want to assure you that you carry with you the pride of this nation. And I know you see it everywhere you go. And when you wear that uniform off the base, walking to a grocery store, you hear it , and not just here in Wisconsin, but all over the this country. The American people love the men and women of our armed forces, and they are grateful for your service. I promise you that. You also carry with you the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief and all of those in our chain of command and the leadership who see the extraordinary professionalism here at Fort McCoy and know we can count on you. And let me lastly say, with great confidence, I also know that you serve carried by the prayers of the American people. You know, the sweetest words that I ever hear as I travel across this country are when people will take a minute to tell me and my wife, they tell the President and First Lady, ""We're praying for you."" And I want to assure all of you: Millions of Americans are praying for all of you; are grateful for all of you; and praying for all those who pass through here at Fort McCoy to go into harm's way, benefitting by your preparation and the training that they receive here. They pray, in those ancient words, that ""no harm [would] befall you [no harm would] come near your tent. [That] He [would] command His angels concerning you, to watch over you in all your ways."" So be confident, soldiers, you have the prayers of the American people. (Applause.) You do. But thank you for the honor of being with you today, men and women who have answered the call. You've put on the uniform. I leave here today with renewed confidence that as long as we have men and women with the courage to serve, the selflessness to step forward; as long as we have heroes willing to put their lives on the line for our freedom; and as long as we have patriots like all of you, we will protect this nation. We will defend our freedom. And we will forge a future of security, and prosperity, and peace for ourselves and generations to come. Thank you. God bless you here at Fort McCoy. And God bless America.

VSMP185201980	Mike Pence	2019-05-18	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Taylor University Commencement Ceremony	speech	"Thank you so much. To President Haines, the Board of Trustees, faculty, staff, family, distinguished guests: It is an honor for us to be here at the Kesler Center for the commencement ceremony of Taylor University Class of 2019. (Applause.) Congratulations. You made it! (Applause.) And I want to thank you, President Haines. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for those warm words. I only wish that my parents could have heard them. (Laughter.) My father would have enjoyed it, and my mother would've believed it. (Laughter.) But would you all join me in thanking President Haines for the extraordinary leadership he's provided here to Taylor University? (Applause.) We are all so grateful. And it's great to be here with so many friends of ours. Met a lot of them backstage. It's always good to be back in Indiana. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from a friend I just spoke to on the phone on my way over to Taylor, shortly after we landed. He asked me to pass along his regards. So allow me to extend congratulations to the graduating class of 2019 from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It is a joy to be back home again here in the Hoosier State with all of you with somebody who is the most special person in my life. You know, I always wait to introduce the highest-ranking official last. She's a Marine Corps mom. She's a champion for military families. She even teaches art at a Christian school. Would you join me in giving one more welcome to the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence? (Applause.) Karen and I are really honored to be back on this beautiful campus. It really is amazing to think: For more than 170 years, Taylor University has faithfully carried out its mission ""to develop servant leaders marked with a passion to minister Christ's redemptive love and truth to a world in need."" We heard those themes again from the podium already today. And the class of 2019 is emblematic of that mission, and you are a remarkable class. You come from 29 different states, 21 different nations, and I learned on the way here that more than 300 of you are graduating from Taylor University today with honors. Congratulations to you all. Well done. (Applause.) And among you are scholars, accomplished musicians and artists, and exceptional athletes. In fact , in fact, I heard that all 18 of Taylor's Trojan teams have been recognized as ""Scholar-Athletes"" by the NAIA. Give yourselves another round of applause. That's great. (Applause.) And behind all of these incredible achievements, of course, are some really special people. Like a young woman who began her career at Taylor as an education major , but over the course of her time here, she was pulled in a different direction. She's gone on several mission trips abroad to minister to children in need. She's dedicated her time and talent, alongside her parents, to care for refugees. And today she volunteers at least three days a week at an afterschool program here in Upland. And today, she will become Taylor University's first ever major in Orphans and Vulnerable Children. Join me in congratulating Rachael Rower on a great academic career. Where are you, Rachael? (Applause.) We're proud of you. And I also was told that Rachael is engaged to be married in just under a month. (Applause.) So I guess I have to recognize another member of the class , (laughter) , her fiancé, Joey Ferguson. (Applause.) Well done, Joey. You outkicked your coverage. (Laughter.) God bless them both. And, you know, I was told there's another member of the Class of 2019 that I just have to mention, because I'm told he's left an indelible mark on just about everybody he's met here at Taylor. He's a great student, of course, and apparently a really good soccer player. Good photographer. Hard worker. Clear thinker. And that, even more than his rich Irish accent, is his deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. It's impressed everybody he's met. In fact, this young man is joined today, I'm told, by his parents, who had never been to the United States of America before today, but they just flew in to see this Taylor graduate walk across this stage. So congratulations to Charbel Salako. Where are you? (Applause.) And to Charbel's parents: Welcome to America! (Laughter and applause.) What a great day. And I know this is a great day for all of you in the Class of 2019. And it should be fun , because winners have fun, and you're all winners today. And you know that you didn't get here on your own, though. The leaders here at Taylor University poured themselves into you , this administration, this incredible staff, and, of course, the men and women of Taylor's faculty. You know, it's probably pretty safe to say that these professors didn't go easy on you. They pressed you over the last four years. They challenged you, too. They made you better. They made you smarter. They made you more ready. So would you join me in thanking all the great faculty here at Taylor University for all they have done for you? (Applause.) And while I serve as your Vice President , and before that, as the president said here, I served as governor of this great state , the highest position I'll ever hold is actually spelled ""D-A-D."" You know, Karen and I are the proud parents of three college graduates , (applause) , and that's worth a round of applause. Got them all through. So honestly, we understand, on a very personal level, the sacrifices that your families have made to help you reach this moment. And we understand just how proud they are, as they sit all around us today. And it's an emotional day for them, I promise you. They're remembering not , not just the times that you were here at Taylor; they're remembering all those days that led up to it. They drove you to school, got you to do your homework before you went to bed. And even while you were here, they encouraged you through late nights before final exams, and , and they wrote a few checks along the way, too. (Laughter.) And they prayed , I know they did , for each and every one of you, every day that you were here. So before we go any further, would all the moms and dads who are here , all the parents who are here , would you all just stand up so we can show you the appreciation that all these great graduates feel for all the support and love over the last four years? (Applause.) Men and women of the Class of 2019, today you will graduate from an extraordinary university. You'll begin your journey. New careers. New endeavors. And you know, they say timing is everything. And to this great class, I just want to tell you, straight up: You picked a great time to graduate from Taylor University. The America that awaits your energies and ambitions is experiencing a new era of optimism and opportunity. You're beginning your careers at a time of a growing American economy and restored American stature at home and abroad. You know, as Vice President, it's my honor, more than I can say, to serve alongside a President who has stood so strong for our national defense. And on this Armed Forces Day, we honor all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard who defend our freedom every day. (Applause.) And to all the veterans who are here with us today, thank you for your service. (Applause.) And I couldn't be more proud to be part of an administration that has stood strong on the timeless values that have made this nation great, and stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) But for all those accomplishments, you deserve to know that your timing really is great. Because under the leadership of President Trump, we've been busy getting this economy moving again. We cut taxes. We rolled back regulation. We've unleashed American energy. And as I stand before you today, the economy that awaits you , businesses large and small , have created 5.8 million new jobs in just over the last two years. Unemployment is at a near 50-year low. And get this: Today, there are more job openings in America than there are Americans looking for work. That's great timing, Class of 2019. (Applause.) Not that Taylor grads are going to have any trouble finding a job. You know, I actually heard that 97 percent of Taylor graduates secure work or graduate school placement within the first six months of graduation. It's a testament to this extraordinary university. You know, the many Taylor grads I've worked with over the years are some of the smartest and most dedicated men and women I've ever known. In fact, I'm proud that we got a Taylor grad serving on the staff of the Office of the Vice President at the White House, even as we speak. So when you leave this remarkable place, I promise you, you're going to find an America filled with promise. And I know the men and women of this Class of 2019 are going to thrive. Because you have the support of your families. You have a foundation of a great and unique education. And because, here at Taylor, it was all built on a foundation of faith , a foundation that cannot be shaken. You know, it really is beautiful that, before you leave here today, you'll be handed a diploma; you'll also be handed a Bible and a Servant's Towel. And I believe these elements hold the keys to the success and fulfillment in the lives that await you. And I know what I'm talking about. You know, like many of you, I was raised in a church home. But by the time I got to high school, I lost interest in religion. I was one of those people who still went to church, but I was just going through the motions , you know, holding form of Christianity, but denying its power. By the time I went off to college , a little school down south of here , I just went my own way. But when I went to school, I started to meet people , maybe like you have here , that I could tell where different. Some people that had something I lacked. And it wasn't just confidence or an easy familiarity; it was something they had that I knew I didn't have. The only way I could describe it was peace and a joy about everything in their lives. In fact, I was so moved by their example that I started attending a Christian fellowship group on campus. And I had this friend who ran the group. He was a senior; I was a freshman. And we became good friends. And I talked to him a lot about faith issues. And he spent a lot of time with me and was very patient. But I noticed, you know, as I got more involved in the local fellowship group, that I decided I was going to go ahead and get involved. And he was wearing this really cool little cross everywhere he went. So I started asking him where he got it , you know, because I wanted to get one, too. Frankly, I started to pester him about it. (Laughter.) It was back then before you had these things that you're always looking at, and we had these catalogues you order things from , you had to call on the phone. (Laughter.) Your mom and dad will explain that to you. (Laughter.) And I kept bothering him about the catalogue. I said, ""Hey, be sure and get me that catalogue because, you know, I want to order that cross."" I said, ""I've decided to go ahead and do the Christian thing. So, you know, I want to , you know, I want to start wearing a cross."" (Laughter.) I'll never forget , John looked at me one day and said some words that I'll never forget. I said to him, ""Don't forget about that catalogue."" And he turned around, and he looked at me, and he said, ""Mike, remember: You got to wear it in your heart before you wear it around your neck."" (Applause.) To be honest with you, I didn't know what he meant. But I knew there was truth in it. I wrestled with those words. Then a little while later, I found myself at a youth Christian music festival that the group went to down in Wilmore, Kentucky. We sat on a hillside for two days, listening to some great contemporary Christian music and messages in between. And it was on a rainy night, sitting on that hillside back in 1978, that I heard some words I'd heard my whole life in Church , but I heard them different. I'd always heard that ""God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life."" But on that Saturday night, I heard it different. Sitting on that hillside, I realized that it also meant God so loved me that He gave His only Son to save me from my sin. And overwhelmed not with guilt, but with a heart overflowing with gratitude, that night I put my faith in Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. And it's made all the difference in my life. (Applause.) So now I want to say, not so much as your Vice President or a fellow Hoosier, but as a brother in Christ: If what you've seen and heard and learned in this place has also taken hold in your hearts, I want to encourage you to go from here, and live it out, and share it, and put feet on your faith as you carry and minister over the course of your lives. Because America needs men and women of integrity and faith now more than ever. You know, the truth is that we live in a time when religious belief is under assault. We've seen unspeakable acts of violence against religious communities. Synagogues in Pennsylvania and California. Mosques in New Zealand. Churches in Sri Lanka. And three historically black churches burned to the ground in Louisiana. And on a much lesser scale, but more prevalent, we see a change in our culture as well. You know, throughout most of American history, it's been pretty easy to call yourself a Christian , but things are different now. Lately, it's become acceptable, even fashionable, to malign traditional Christian beliefs. So as you prepare to leave this place and build your life on the Christ-centered, world-engaging foundation poured here at Taylor University, be prepared to stand up. You know, as Dr. Milo Rediger wrote in ""Anchor Points"" so long ago, he said, quote, ""we're looking for young people [here at Taylor] who are willing to stand up and be counted for God."" And as you stand up, be prepared to face opposition. But be confident. For the Bible says, ""God has given us a spirit not of timidity, but of power and love and self-control."" So go show the world every day that we can love God and love our neighbor at the same time. (Applause.) Our nation and our world needs it. And know also that freedom of religion is enshrined not just in the Constitution, but in the hearts of every American. And I promise you: We will always stand up for the freedom of religion and for the right of every American to live, to learn, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience. That's a promise. (Applause.) And finally, as you prepare to depart on your lives and careers, I hope that you will take one other piece of that foundation poured here at Taylor University along. I hope that you will aspire to serve. To be, as that towel will ever remind you, a servant leader. You know, I believe public service is a noble calling. But wherever life takes you, take a servant's attitude. Consider others more important than yourselves. Live your lives as He did: not to be served, but to serve. And if you need examples, you can just look around the people that are sitting with you. A lot of young men and women here have already learned: The fulfilled life is the life of service to others. Like a public health major who grew up in Illinois who is graduating today. Like many of you Taylor students, she traveled overseas to give her time and talent to help those in need. But, as the story goes, during her J-term of her sophomore year, she was serving on a mission trip in the Middle East, and this young woman started to feel what she called ""a little tug from God."" Since then, that little tug has turned into a calling, and a calling that she's answered. And after graduation, this incredible young woman will move to the Middle East and serve as a Women's Health Coordinator for the non-profit One Collective. So would you all join me in showing our appreciation for the great example of 2019 graduate, Claire Heyen. Well done, Claire. We're proud of you. (Applause.) So, Class of 2019, my word to all of you is: Never stop believing, never stop serving, and always be prepared to give a reason for the hope that you have, with gentleness and respect. Because our nation and our world need that message of grace and love these days maybe more than ever before. And as you do these things, in increasing measure, I promise you, you'll be blessed. You'll be a blessing to your family, to your coworkers, and you'll be a blessing to this nation. You know, America has always been a nation of faith. As our first Vice President, John Adams, said, and I quote, ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."" So just know, as you strengthen the foundation of faith in your life; as you carry that faith from here, in service to your fellow Americans, you will be strengthening the foundation of America itself. (Applause.) So thank you for the honor of addressing you. To all of our graduates, I say: Have faith. Have faith in yourselves, proven by what you've accomplished to get you to this very day. Have faith in the principles and the ideals that you learned here and the noble mission that has always animated Taylor University. And have faith that He who brought you this far will never leave you, nor forsake you , because He never will. Congratulations, Class of 2019. You did it. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless America.

VSMP205201979	Mike Pence	2019-05-20	Remarks by Vice President Pence at America First Policies Event USMCA: A Better Deal for American Workers	speech	"Well, hello, Florida! (Applause.) It is great to be back in the Sunshine State with the men and women who supported a President and have supported policies that are putting America first. Thank you for coming out today. (Applause.) And let me just begin by thanking a couple of the people that you've heard from today already. I have to tell you, he was an incredible governor for the state of Florida. But in a very short period of time he has emerged as one of the most influential conservative voices in the United States Senate. He's a champion for a growing American economy. (Applause.) He's a champion for Florida. He is a champion for freedom in this hemisphere and around the world. Would you join me in thanking Senator Rick Scott one more time for his outstanding leadership? (Applause.) Thank you, Rick. Thank you so much. And to these great members of Congress who are here today , Congressman Rutherford, Congressman Waltz, and Mayor Lenny Curry , what a great panel. What a great discussion. Great to have you here today. (Applause.) Mayor, congratulations on your election earlier this year. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your great, great leadership at the local level. And one more person to thank: our host today. I got to know her back on the campaign trail. I served alongside her on the President's Cabinet. But now she's stepped forward to lead this organization, America First Policies. She is now serving as the national chairman. Join me in thanking Linda McMahon, who's one of the great, great champion of this agenda. (Applause.) Thank you, Linda. What an incredible person. And speaking of friends of mine and great leaders , I was talking to him on the phone earlier today. Told him I was headed to Florida and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Florida and who gets up every day and fights to keep the promises that he made to the people of the Sunshine State. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, in our first year in office, President Trump promised the American people that we were going to, in his words, ""hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers rebuild America's cities and towns,"" because, he said, ""when we grow American manufacturing, we don't [just] grow wages [we] grow America's spirit."" And, you know, back when I was governor in the state of Indiana, I used to say, ""We do two things well in this part of the country: We make things and we grow things."" And what was true in the Hoosier State is true right here in the Sunshine State. And I'm proud to say, under President Trump's leadership, American manufacturing and American agriculture are growing again. (Applause.) Particularly when it comes to manufacturing, I have to tell you, it's amazing to think in just over two years' time, after we rolled back federal regulations at a historic level, we unleashed American energy. And after this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history, this American economy is soaring. (Applause.) I mean, think about it. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country, like those represented in this room today so well, have created 5.8 million new jobs, including 454,000 good-paying jobs right here in Florida. (Applause.) Isn't that something? The unemployment rate has hit a nearly 50-year low, and the unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest ever recorded in American history. (Applause.) The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) And as our economy is expanding, the great news is wages are rising. Wages are rising across this countr at the fastest pace that they have in more than 10 years. And I think what means the most to President Trump and I is that wages today are rising most rapidly among working families. Blue-collar workers all across this country are receiving the most rapid pay increases of any part of our economy. In a word, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. It's working, America! (Applause.) In fact , now, here is a real statistic for you: For the first time ever, and now for the 13th month in a row, we're in the 13th straight month where there are more job openings in America than there are Americans looking for work. That's not only the longest streak in history, but it had never happened before. (Applause.) It really is amazing. And it's particularly amazing to see how manufacturing has come roaring back under this President's leadership. In the last administration, we all remember the story about American manufacturing. The last administration actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs all across this country and across this state. And remember, the last President said we'd never get them back. I remember in the middle of 2016, the last President, remember he said , when he was asked about manufacturing jobs, he said , he said, ""What magic wand do you have?"" (Laughter.) Do you remember that? Well, we didn't need a ""magic wand."" We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. (Applause.) It's true. Because the truth is, with the policies that you all have supported, and building on the policies that we're talking about here today, the truth is, after the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs, since Election Day 2016, get this: Businesses across this country have created 500,000 manufacturing jobs , (applause) , including more than 20,000 right here in Florida. (Applause.) You know, I'm told 2018 was not only the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years; it actually marked the highest level of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. In fact, the CEO that just left the stage a few minutes ago, he's got manufacturing plants all over the country, and he just told me , he said, ""All of our plants are humming."" He said it's all happening. So, manufacturing has come roaring back here in Florida and all across this country because of the policies that you all have supported. But I'll tell you, while our policies have made a big difference, the President and I, we come from a philosophy that knows that it's the people of America, it's the enterprises of America that are doing all the work. I mean, I'm proud to be part of an administration that's been letting people keep more of what they earn, lower the business tax rate so that companies here in Florida can compete with companies anywhere around the world; rolled back more federal red tape in two years than any President in American history that unleashed American energy. But the President and I all know that it's the American people taking advantage of those low tax rates and that new economic freedom that's really made the difference. Your work ethic, your determination, your integrity , that's what's been driving the growth and businesses across Florida and all across this country. And I know in this room there's all kinds of great American success stories, like a heating and air-conditioning business that I was told on my way here has actually seen its revenue grow 35 percent each year since our administration took office. (Applause.) How about that? And they told us that because of the tax cuts the President signed into law, this family-owned business has been able to use that money. It's invested in its workers. It actually started an apprenticeship program that allows high-school graduates to earn a solid income while they learn a trade. In fact, with this booming economy, this company has already invested $200,000 in career development for its employees, and they're just getting started. So would you join me in thanking the CEO and owner of Bold City AC, Mirza Pilakovic? (Applause.) Where are you, Mirza? Great job! Great job. Great job. I'm also told here's another small business here that's celebrating its 80th year in business. And while they've enjoyed eight consecutive years of revenue growth, I was actually told, walking in the door here, that after all the policies that you've supported by this administration, their revenue grew last year by 45 percent. (Applause.) And that new income has allowed the company to reinvest, use an accelerated tax depreciation that we included in that bill, reinvest in ways , new equipment. It's going to create all-new jobs. And in the last five months, they've done that more than in any previous year. Their company is growing by leaps and bounds. They're creating jobs right here in this community. So join me in thanking the CEO of Drummond Press, John Falconetti. (Applause.) John, take a bow, will you? Great job, John. Thank you. These are the people that are making America happen. And I'll tell you what: This businessman-turned-President knows that. He knows it's the men and women that are running businesses large and small that are really driving this American economy. And so we want to commend you. And I wanted to let you know we're going to keep fighting for you. The truth is, these two men are just emblematic of, really, everybody in this room , people who really understand what makes the American economy hum and grow. But for all that we're doing out of Washington, D.C., we know that you're the ones that are renewing this economy with your hard work. But I came here to tell you that we're proud of everybody. We're proud of the progress that we've made in this economy. We're grateful for your support. Because all that we've done so far has made a real difference in the lives of everyday Americans. But I can tell you, that guy I serve with every day, all that we've accomplished , the 5.8 million new jobs, real momentum, America standing tall at home and abroad , that's just what President Trump calls a good start. (Applause.) And so, Florida, we're going to go right to work to build on that momentum and keep this American economy growing. (Applause.) And to do that, President Trump and I both know that we've got to level the playing field for American workers, and workers here in Florida, to be able to compete with companies around the world. And it begins by forging trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. That's what America First is all about. (Applause.) And we've been fighting for it every day. From Europe to the Pacific, this President has been fighting against unfair trade practices. We've been negotiating new trade deals that promote free, fair, and , what the President likes to say , reciprocal trade. I mean, ours is an administration that believes in free trade. But we also believe that nations that we trade with ought to treat us like we treat them. Right? That's what ""reciprocal"" is really all about. And I'm really proud to report that the President took a strong stand not long ago, and we have great progress in the headlines today. Thanks to the President's leadership, as he said earlier today, ""our great farmers can begin doing business again in [with] Mexico and Canada."" (Applause.) The retaliatory tariffs are gone. It's a big deal. Now, you all remember the President took decisive action to protect American steel and aluminum not long ago. But the President reached an arrangement that I was a part of these discussions going forward, with the Prime Minister of Canada in particular, where we reached an agreement that puts American steel first. We're defending American jobs. But also, we've negotiated for Mexico and Canada to lift their retaliatory tariffs on American pork, cheese, and orange juice. Under this new agreement, Florida's farmers are going to win like never before. (Applause.) So we've strengthened American steel and aluminum with , the very infrastructure and the backbone of the American economy. And we also managed to negotiate those tariffs that had been retaliated , used as retaliation against the United States. But now the big task at hand is what really brings me here today. I came here to Florida today to tell you: For all that we've done so far, for all that we've done to keep this economy moving, the time has come for the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. The time has come for Congress to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) Make no mistake about it: The USMCA is a win for Florida and a win for America. The President has done his job; it's time for the Congress to do their job and pass the USMCA this summer. (Applause.) Truly what brought me here today. I've literally been traveling all over the country talking about the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the difference that it's going to make not just in manufacturing and in agriculture, but in industries all across this economy. Now, we all remember NAFTA. It was adopted back in the mid-1990s. And, you know, you don't have to tell people from the Heartland of the country about the impact that NAFTA had on our communities. Up in the Hoosier State, we literally saw almost entire communities shuttered, as manufacturing factories closed after NAFTA and moved south of the border. But, men and women of the Sunshine State, those days are over. (Applause.) The USMCA levels the playing field and puts American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) I promise you. The USMCA is actually going to impact more than 2 million manufacturing jobs that depend on exports to Canada and Mexico. We believe it's absolutely essential that it get passed by the Congress because it will also finally allow American workers and farmers to compete in this hemisphere on a level playing field. The USMCA actually is going to end programs in Canada that allow low-priced products to undercut American dairy.The agreement is going to ensure that product grading is fair and transparent. It'll also help Americans protect the innovative technologies that give us an edge in global marketplace. Many of these things were never even addressed in NAFTA. You know, there was a rule under the old NAFTA agreement that if a particular manufactured product wasn't mentioned in NAFTA, that it wasn't covered by any of the existing tariffs. So, truthfully, nations like China were able to manufacture products, ship them to Canada or ship them to Mexico, and send them into the United States, duty-free. But those days are over. We are not going to allow an outdated trade deal to hurt American manufacturers or American farmers anymore. (Applause.) We're not going to let them undermine good-paying jobs that build the American class , American middle class in this country or the middle class I grew up in, I'm a part of, and it's rebuilding the American middle class today. You know, and under the USMCA, as the President loves to say, the American worker is going to win like never before. But, men and women of Florida, I'm here not just to tell you how important this is, but I'm here to ask for your help. The clock is ticking. It's time. I mean, the truth of the matter is that there's an old saying , I was in the Congress for 12 years , it's an old saying that Congress does two things well: nothing and overreact. (Laughter.) The truth of the matter is, we can't afford Congress to do nothing. We need Congress to approve the USMCA this summer to keep America growing. (Applause.) All right? As I said, the President has done his job. We negotiated a deal that puts American jobs and workers first. Now it's time , it's time for Congress to do their job. But I got to tell you, you all are going to be the people that make the difference. And I want you to let your voice be heard. I hope you'll leave here today, and give another round of applause to these great congressmen, this great senator, this great panel, the mayor, and Linda. (Applause.) I couldn't be more grateful to America First Policies for putting this event together because it's going to equip you to be able to go out and make the case for the USMCA, and we need you to do it. And not just among your neighbors and friends, but we need you to reach out. Reach out to elected officials all across this great state. Let them know just how important this is. Reach out to people in both political parties. And I also know there's businesses here , you know, Florida businesses do business all over this country and all over the world. So I just encourage you to spin that rolodex. And for you young people, ask somebody my age what a rolodex was. (Laughter.) Send out an e-mail. Say, ""You know, I was in Jacksonville the other day. I ran into Mike and a couple of these great congressmen, and they were telling me about this USMCA and you got to get behind it."" Just send word out all across the country. I mean, the truth is, we need to hear , we need to hear from all of you to get this done. And the truth is, Washington, D.C. is always chasing after one story or another, aren't they? I mean, I get up in the morning and I , sometimes I turn on the television with a stick. You know, I don't even , (laughter) , did you get that one? Okay. (Laughter.) I mean, I never even know what's going to be on there. But you all know this economy is growing; it's thriving. America is standing tall again. Confidence is back. Jobs are coming back. You know that America is back, but America needs the USMCA to keep growing, and we need you to go tell the story. Will you do it? (Applause.) You know, I'll always believe that, you know, when the American people set their mind to something and let their voice be heard, there's nothing that we can't accomplish and there's nothing that Congress won't step up and do. So I just encourage you to let your voice be heard and let people know just how important this is. Let them know about the great stories that are happening in this economy and just how much this agreement with Canada and Mexico is going to mean to a growing Florida economy. And I'm absolutely convinced: If all of us do all that we can in the days ahead to call on our leaders at every level, to call on our peers in business, our neighbors and our friends, to tell the story of just how important this USMCA is; if all of us get behind the men and women like Senator Rick Scott, these great congressmen, and all the leaders that are standing up for the policies that are growing this economy; that with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with that support, and with God's help, I really do believe we've only just begun to see what this economy can do for this generation and the next. And we will make Florida more prosperous and more secure than ever before. And to borrow a phrase, we will make America great again. (Applause.) So let's get out there. Let's get the USMCA done, and done for America. Thank you. God bless you. And god bless the United States. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1343773/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-america-first-policies-event-usmca-a-better-deal-for-american-workers&speechType=1	Trade		Jacksonville, FL	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-america-first-policies-event-usmca-better-deal-american-workers-jacksonville-fl/
VSMP255201978	Mike Pence	2019-05-25	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the West Point Graduation Ceremony	speech	"Secretary Esper, General Milley, Lieutenant General Williams, Congressman Meadows, distinguished guests, faculty, and families: It is a great honor and deeply humbling for me to be here today, at the United States Military Academy, with the extraordinary men and women of West Point's 221st graduating class, the Class of 2019. You made it! (Applause.) And it's my honor to be here on behalf of a great champion of all those who wear the uniform of the United States. So allow me to bring greetings and congratulations to the Class of 2091 from your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it was just a few short weeks ago the President and I had the honor of welcoming West Point back to the White House as the Army Black Knights received the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy for the second year in a row. (Applause.) And as the President said, in his words, ""The United States Armed Forces are the strongest, toughest, bravest, and fiercest warriors"" in the world. And today, Class of 2019, you join their ranks. You chose to come here and you were chosen to come here. From R-Day, when you were given 90 seconds to say goodbye to your loved ones, from that first day just over the rise when you marched onto The Plain as plebes on Acceptance Day, you committed yourselves to service and excellence. And over the last four years, you've proved yourselves. You are, as the President likes to say, ""the best of the best."" And as a sign of the gratitude for the many years of service that you will render to America, your Commander-in-Chief has given me the authority to hereby absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses, effective immediately. (Applause.) You know, it really is deeply humbling for me to stand before you today and see this sight and to be in this historic place. You see, my life didn't take me into the uniform of the United States. But I'm the son of a soldier. My dad, who is gone 30 years now, but he was a veteran of combat in the Korean War, and he was a member of the United States Army. (Applause.) And as I stand before you today, here at West Point, I can't help but think that First Lieutenant Edward J. Pence, looking down from glory, is finally impressed with his third son. (Laughter.) So thank you for the honor. (Applause.) Since its founding here along the Hudson River 217 years ago, the United States Military Academy has educated, trained, and inspired Corps of Cadets on a foundation of values: duty, honor, country. Those words are engraved on your class ring but they're also now embedded in your hearts. And they're the values that will carry you from this day in service to this great nation. Every West Point grad joins a long tradition of leadership and sacrifice. And today, this incredible class will take its rightful place on the long gray line, with names like Grant, Eisenhower, MacArthur, and all those who trained here , just like a member of the Class of 1959, who ended his life's journey not too long ago. He graduated from here in West Point. He would go on to seek combat in Vietnam. He became a captain of industry, he served four American presidents, and his name now graces the visitor's center here at West Point. And today we remember Frederic V. Malek, and we are so honored that his wife Marlene and family are here with us today. (Applause.) You join distinguished ranks, just like the men of the Class of 1969 that are going to place those bars on your shoulders today. Among them is a man who was commissioned in armor, also served in Vietnam, and would eventually assume command of the V Corps, where he led 140,000 soldiers in the triumphant march to Baghdad in 2003. For his service, he received the [Defense] Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star. So would you all join me in recognizing the Class of 1969 and their own General Scottie Wallace? (Applause.) And the Class of 2019 is made up of just such men and women. You're 985 strong , from all 50 states and 10 countries. Among you are three Fulbright scholars, three Marshall scholars, an NRA Second Team All-American, and star athletes who led West Point to six Patriot League champions this year and beat Navy for the third year in a row. (Applause.) This is a class full of amazing Americans, like a young cadet from Georgia who's graduating today. In addition to his degree in nuclear engineering, he became the first-ever cadet to win four consecutive individual Men's Boxing National Championships. Join me in recognizing Cadet Carlan Ivey for all he's accomplished. (Applause.) Carlan, where are you? Great job. Or an impressive young woman from San Jose. She's graduating today with a degree in life science. As a third-year, she was awarded a Goldwater Scholarship , the oldest and most prestigious award in natural sciences. And as a Firstie, she won the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. So join me in recognizing Cadet Madeline Ryu! Where are you, Madeline? Great job. (Applause.) Now, you all know these cadets are just emblematic of all of you. And also, I want to acknowledge the historic milestones that we're marking today. The Class of 2019 is the most diverse class in the history of the United States Military Academy. (Applause.) Those milestones include: Today, you're graduating the 1000th Jewish cadet , (applause) , the 5000th female cadet, including the highest number of Hispanic women graduates. (Applause.) And since the last time I was here, I had the privilege of speaking at the Henry Flipper dinner, honoring the first African American to ever graduate from West Point. I couldn't be more proud to stand before the graduating class of 2019 that includes the highest number of African American women cadets in the history of the United States Military Academy! (Applause.) So, for what you've accomplished and for who you are, congratulations, Class of 2019. You did it! (Applause.) And, of course, today we also celebrate and pause to remember three men of honor who couldn't be with us today. They stepped forward to serve their country but they did not live to see this moment. So, to their families, we say: The United States Army and America will never forget and never fail to honor the service of Thomas Surdyke, Peter Zhu, and Brandon Jackson. (Applause.) And, Class of 2019, as the Superintendent said, while this is your day, you know you didn't get here on your own. For four years, your TAC officers and NCOs whipped you into shape, your professors poured themselves into your lives. And as you made the long journey from plebe to firstie, I know you also made some of the best friends of your life. They helped you through papers, and TEEs, and your friends maybe even helped you through a few scenic walks on the Area. Together, you braved six weeks of ""Beast Barracks,"" you traded pointers on how to pass your next SAMI, and I'll bet you also marveled together at each other's ""crass mass of brass and glass."" (Laughter and applause.) But long before you arrived on campus, it was your families who were there. They believed you could get here. They believed in you, even when you didn't always believe in yourself. They encouraged you, they prayed for you. And when they pin those bars on your shoulders, I know it's going to be one of the proudest days of their lives. And I know what I'm talking about. I'm not just the son of a soldier, but I'm the proud father of a United States Marine. (Applause.) And my wife and have lived this day. So before we go one step further, Class of 2019, would you all just mind breaking training a little bit? Would you just stand up, look to the left, to the right, and behind you, and catch the eye of the moms and dads, and brothers and sisters, and boyfriends and girlfriends who are here, who got you to this place? Get on your feet and just show them how much you appreciate , (applause) , all they've done to get you to this moment. (Applause.) Great job. So, Class of 2019, today, a journey that started four years ago is ending but a new journey begins. Today, you take up your duties as second lieutenants in the United States Army, and you accept a great responsibility in this republic. Behind me, across the Lusk Reservoir, stands a memorial dedicated to the American soldier. It reads, and I quote, ""The lives and destinies of valiant Americans are entrusted to your care,"" and, by those words, to your leadership as well. Men and women of the Class of 2019, you're being given the greatest gift an American leader can have, with the greatest responsibility. America's parents have given you our most precious possession , our sons and daughters. And they ask of you only one thing: lead them well. (Applause.) When you came here, the world was a dangerous place, and it still is. But I'm pleased to report to you reinforcements that, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, you're joining an Army that's better equipped, better trained, and better supplied than any United States Army in the history of this country. (Applause.) It's true. In the last two years, we've taken decisive action to rebuild our military and restore the arsenal of democracy. This President has actually signed into law the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And as you accept the mantle of leadership, I promise you: Your Commander-in-Chief will always have your back. President Donald Trump is the best friend the men and women of our armed forces will ever have! (Applause.) Proving that, just a few months ago, your Commander-in-Chief proposed the largest defense budget in American history: $750 billion to ensure the strongest fighting force in the history of the world becomes stronger still. We fund an end strength of more than 2 million active and reserved military personnel. We'll modernize w armored brigade combat teams, and we'll also provide resources for 12 battle force ships, 2 large unmanned surface ships, and 110 fighter aircraft. And with that renewed American strength, the United States is once again embracing our role as leader of the free world. We're standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before. And we've taken the fight against radical Islamic terrorists, on our terms, on their soil. And thanks to the courage of our armed forces, just a few short months ago, the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS was liberated. (Applause.) But the truth is, you are taking up your duties at a time of growing challenges to freedom all around the world. So I say to all of you: What you've learned in this place, put into practice. You've learned the habits of heroes and leaders. And now you're going to join the fight. Men and women of West Point, no matter where you're deployed, you will be the vanguard of freedom, and you know that the ""soldier does not bear the sword in vain."" The work you do has never been more important. America will always seek peace, but peace comes through strength. And you are now that strength. (Applause.) It is a virtual certainty that you will fight on a battlefield for America at some point in your life. You will lead soldiers in combat. It will happen. Some of you will join the fight against radical Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and Iraq. Some of you will join the fight on the Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific, where North Korea continues to threaten the peace, and an increasingly militarized China challenges our presence in the region. Some of you will join the fight in Europe, where an aggressive Russia seeks to redraw international boundaries by force. And some of you may even be called upon to serve in this hemisphere. And when that day comes, I know you will move to the sound of the guns and do your duty, and you will fight, and you will win. The American people expect nothing less. (Applause.) So, wherever you're called, I urge you to take what you learned here and put it into practice. Put your armor on, so that when , not if , that day comes, you'll be able to stand your ground. It's your turn to lead heroes. But to lead heroes, you must be a hero. To lead them, you must be worthy of them. In a word, you must be men and women of integrity. You know, over the course of my life, I've learned that the three most important qualities of leadership, in any human endeavor, are humility, orientation to authority, and self-control. The first is humility. You'll be entering the service as officers, but you should, right now, decide that you're going to consider others more important than yourself. Approach every problem with a spirit of humility. As the Good Book says, ""One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off."" Approach every challenge as a listener. The best decisions are made through counsel and collaboration. Have the humility to listen. And, second, orientation to authority. You've learned it here; now live it out. Like the Centurion who took the Nazarene at his word, saying he was ""a man under authority,"" so you will be men and women under authority. Respect the chain of command. Submit yourself to the authorities placed above you. Trust your superiors. Trust your orders. And finally, you've gone through a rigorous four years of training here , a time of great personal discipline. Don't lose that. Discipline is the foundation of all accomplishment. Be an example of self-discipline to the men and women you lead, and you'll inspire them without saying a word. To lead others, you must lead yourself first. Cultivate these virtues as you've already begun to do here at this great academy, and I know you'll lead with distinction. You know, I've walked across a few stages in my life, and raised my right hand, and taken an oath like you're going to take today. At least for me, I wondered in those moments whether I could meet the moment. But I've come here today, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, to tell you: Class of 2019, you're ready. (Applause.) So, lead with integrity. Be an example. Mind your mission. Take care of your soldiers. And you will stand your ground. Like the Third Army in the Ardennes forest. Like the 1st Cav at LZ X-Ray. Like the 4th ID at COP Keating. You will stand your ground. There will be times when you've rucked 10 miles, on two hours' sleep, with 80 pounds on your back, without much to eat. But you'll do your duty. You'll stand your ground. Because the United States Army never quits. It never accepts defeat. It always puts the mission first. And you, my friends, are Army Strong. (Applause.) So by hewing to the principles and values that you learned here, you will prove yourself worthy of the trust the American people are placing in you today. As you prepare to leave this place, you go with the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief, you go with the support of your families. And I believe with all my heart, you do not go alone. Throughout the long and storied history of this nation, at just the right time, Providence has brought forth just the right leaders to preserve and protect the republic, many of which were forged on these hills. And now you are among them. So as you leave here, never doubt that you have the support of the American people and all of those elected to serve them. And also, never doubt that He who brought you this far will never leave you or forsake you, because He never will. (Applause.) Men and women of the Class of 2019, congratulations. You made it. And I know in the years ahead you will do your part to ensure for ourselves and our posterity that ""Freedom Will Reign."" God bless you and protect you. (Applause.) And God bless our Army and armed forces. And God bless America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1344834/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-west-point-graduation-ceremony&speechType=1	National Security Defense Military Personnel Foreign Affairs Higher Education		West Point, New York	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-west-point-graduation-ceremony/
VSMP275201977	Mike Pence	2019-05-27	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Memorial Day Ceremony	speech	"To Acting Secretary Shanahan, Secretary Wilkie, members of the Cabinet, Secretary Esper, Secretary Wilson, General Dunford, honored guests, especially to the active-duty members of our armed forces, our veterans, and most of all, to our Gold Star families: We are honored by your presence. (Applause.) On behalf of a grateful nation, it is my profound privilege to be here on the hallowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery for the 151st occasion where we gather to pay a debt of honor and gratitude to the memory of those who gave their last full measure of devotion and, as that general order in 19 , in 1868 said first, to ""renew our pledge to aid and assist those whom they have left among us."" As is evident by all your presence here, and by gatherings like this all across America, you know there is a day in November when we remember those who served and came home. But today is the day when, all across America, we pause to honor and remember those who served our nation but did not come home. It is Memorial Day in America. To all of you here, and those looking on from afar, especially to the families of our fallen, we extend our deepest sympathies and we also bring the deepest respects and gratitude of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) The President and the First Lady came here to Arlington just this past Thursday. And while his duties have taken him to the other side of the world, I spoke to him just a little while ago, and I know his heart is here with all of you and with families across this nation, for whom every day is Memorial Day. The Bible says: If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect. And the debt our nation owes to those who rest here among these hallowed fields and in cemeteries, churchyards, and humble plots across the wider world is a debt we can never fully repay. For this is the day that makes possible all other American days. Without it, without the sacrifice we honor at patriots' graves from the four corners of our land and overseas, there would be no other American days. What we celebrate today as Memorial Day began just three short years after the end of the Civil War. It was originally established here as Decoration Day to take place on May 30, 1868, to honor fallen soldiers by decorating their final resting places with newly bloomed May flowers and that ""dear old flag they saved."" And that tradition continues. Since that time, here on the hallowed grounds of Arlington, and in churchyards, national cemeteries, and town squares across the land, Americans gathered to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes and to assure their families that we will never forget, and we never fail to honor, the service and sacrifice of their loved ones. (Applause.) We're actually joined today by two leaders who have quite possibly done more to honor the memory of our fallen and support their families than any other living Americans. For his courageous service in World War II, for all they have both done to preserve the memory of the Greatest Generation, and for their support of military families, would you join me in thanking Senators Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole for their countless contributions to the United States of America? (Applause.) The unbroken cord of military service stretches into the mists of American history. From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood, from San Juan Hill to Saipan, from the Coral Sea to Kandahar, heroic Americans have answered their nation's call and paid the ultimate price for our freedom. Their duty was to serve. Our duty is to remember. History records that more than 40 million have served in the uniform of the United States and nearly 1 million Americans have fallen in uniform since our nation's founding. Americans of every race and creed have fought and died for our freedom, but as I can tell from the faces of those gathered here, you know the numbers don't tell the story. They tell nothing of the lives of promises cut short, of dreams unfulfilled, of families shattered. Words fail when heroes fall. So we do well on this day, each year, just to tell their stories and to let their words and deeds speak for them. David Ker was born in Louisiana in 1893. He was a student at Columbia University but he dropped out of college to fight in World War I. He deployed to France, volunteered to participate in an attack on Saint-Mihiel, and two months before the guns fell silent, at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, Sergeant David Ker fell. After the war, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre with palm for his courageous service. But a day before the attack, Sergeant Ker sent a letter to his mom. He wrote, and I quote: ""Tomorrow the first totally American drive commences, and it gives me inexpressible joy and pride to know that I shall be present to do my share. Should I go under, I want you to know that I went without any terror of death, and that my chief worry is the grief my death will bring to those so dear to me."" And then, he ended, saying, ""I feel wonderfully strong to do my share well for my sake, you must try to drown your sorrow in the pride [and] satisfaction that I died well in so clean a cause as ours."" He ended: ""God bless and keep you, my dear heart be kind to little Elizabeth I love [you] so well David."" Today, we remember the service and sacrifice of Sergeant David Ker. William Robinson Evans, Jr., was born in Indiana in 1918. He was an Eagle Scout. After graduating from college in Connecticut, he enlisted in the Navy's Reserve Officer Pilot Program. He earned his wings of gold and was commissioned as an ensign in May of 1941. In September, he was assigned to a Torpedo Squadron on the USS Hornet. And at 23, he was one of the squadron's youngest pilots. On the 4th of June, 1942, 15 torpedo planes from his squadron went into battle against overwhelming numbers of enemy fighters, and they were all shot down. But their sacrifice and their courage that day helped change the course of world history. Ensign Evans received the Navy Cross posthumously for his heroism during the Air Battle of Midway. But two months before he was lost, he wrote to a friend, these words: ""Many of my friends are now dead. To a man, each died with a nonchalance that each would have denied was courage If anything great or good is born of this war, it should not be valued in the colonies we may win [n]or in the pages historians will attempt to write, but rather in the youth of our country who never trained for war , rather almost never believed in war , [but] who from some hidden source [have] brought forth gallantry which is homespun it is so real."" And then he said: ""I say these things because I knew you liked and understood, boys [and] I wanted you to know they have not let you down."" Today, we remember the service and sacrifice of Ensign Bill Evans, Jr. (Applause.) John Floyd Cochrane was born in Michigan in 1941. First Lieutenant Cochrane served in the 409th Radio Unit in Vietnam. He led a platoon, and a man who served under him would say four decades later that he was ""one great guy."" Lieutenant Cochrane fell to sniper fire on the 24th of October, 1966, just six days before he was scheduled to meet his wife in Hawaii on R&R. In his final letter home, he wrote to his mom and dad these words: ""Tonight I'm awaiting an attack. Yes, that's right. Your only son, who you didn't raise to be stupid, is 11,000 miles away from home, sitting beneath a shaded Coleman lantern on top of a hill, waiting for a visit from our friend ""Charley '"" He later wrote, ""I know why I'm here and why I couldn't be any other place."" He said, ""I do believe that basic principles are enough for a man to die for. We are here because we actually believe that our country is good enough to fight for, and if necessary, [to] die for."" (Applause.) Today, we remember the service and sacrifice of First Lieutenant John Cochrane. (Applause.) Three men, three wars. And as we recall their sacrifices, we cannot help but be inspired by their courage. And make no mistake about it: Their example is inspiring a new generation of heroes every day. Paul Kelly was actually the son of a Vietnam fighter pilot. He was commissioned in 1982 as an officer through the University of Dayton's ROTC program. He served in leadership positions with the Army National Guard. Colonel Paul Kelly was a man who built up all those who served around him. He was known as a dedicated husband to his wife Maria and a proud father of his two sons, John and Paul David Kelly. He was nicknamed ""the Senator"" because he was always shaking soldiers' hands, no matter what the rank. He was a helicopter pilot, but he wasn't manning the stick on 20 January, 2007, when he was lost in Iraq. Ten years later, on July 20, 2017, 10 years after his father died in Iraq, his son, Paul David Kelly, enlisted in the Virginia National Guard. And Private Paul David Kelly, his brother John, and his wonderful mother Maria are here with us today. (Applause.) You honor us with your presence. Your family's three generations of service are an inspiration to us all. These stories of heroes we know from beginning to end, but it's important on this Memorial Day to remember that for some families of our fallen, there is an added burden , the burden of having their loved one resting in a place known but to God. Last year, on this solemn occasion, our President promised that ""we [would] never stop searching for the servicemen and women who remain missing from wars and conflicts fought over the past century."" And we've never stopped. Last June, at his first historic summit in Singapore with Chairman Kim Jong Un, President Trump had our missing fallen on his heart. And as he began negotiations for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Donald Trump also secured a promise for the return of the remains of all fallen U.S. service members lost in North Korea. (Applause.) In August of last year, at Hickam Field in Hawaii, it was our honor to be present when 55 flag-draped coffins bearing the remains of Americans who fought in the Korean War returned to American soil. And I must tell you, for this son of a combat veteran of the Korean War, I will never be given a higher honor than to have been present when our boys were finally coming home. (Applause.) Some of the remains have been identified but more work remains. This is just a beginning. But I can assure you, and assure all the families of our missing fallen, we will never rest until every soldier is accounted for and resting on American soil. (Applause.) So to the families of the fallen, here and looking on, who have sacrificed more than we can comprehend, know that the hearts of every American are with you today, and they'll stay with you every day, as will our prayers. We mourn with those who mourn and we grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope , because our faith gives us hope, and heroes give us hope. ""For no greater love has a man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends."" Today, on Memorial Day, we honor Americans who showed no greater love for the American people. (Applause.) We can never repay the debt of gratitude we owe to the men and women who have given all to preserve our freedom. But we can honor them, remember them, and cherish their families. And this we will do not just this day, but every day. And so long as our nation continues to produce men and women of such selfless courage and patriotism, I know that freedom will ring for ourselves and our posterity. Their duty was to serve. Our duty is to remember. This Memorial Day, let every American renew our commitment to do our duty: to never fail , never fail to remember what they've done for us and never fail to honor and cherish the families they've left behind, and never fail to strive each and every day to be worthy of the freedom that they won for us all. May God bless our heroic fallen. May those who mourn our heroes be comforted until He wipes every tear from their eyes. May God bless the men and women of our Armed Forces. And may God bless America.

VSMP305201916	Mike Pence	2019-05-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada Before Bilateral Meeting	statement	PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Well, it's a pleasure to welcome Vice President Mike Pence to Ottawa for his first official visit , an opportunity for us to talk about all the different ways Canada and the United States have been working well together not just recently, but over generations. Obviously, our primary points of conversation today will be on the ratification process for the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. We're very much looking forward to working together to make sure that the benefits of this agreement, which we took a fair bit of time and energy to get right, but it ended being, as Mike had predicted at a governors' meeting in Rhode Island that I attended, a win-win-win for all three of our countries. And now the ratification process will be another opportunity for us to continue to work together and collaborate for the benefit of our citizens. Also, we're going to be talking about a number of different issues, including the challenges that we're each having in terms of China. We're, of course, very concerned with the Canadians who are being arbitrarily detained in China. And the U.S. has been very strong in its supportive words and its support in general on this issue, as we move forward in a way that keeps the interests of our citizens at the forefront of what we do as governments for our citizens. (Speaks French.) VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you for this warm welcome to Ottawa. It is a great honor for me to be here representing the United States of America in my first visit to Canada as Vice President. And I thank you for the warm hospitality you extended to me and to my wife Karen, and by so many Canadians, as we made our way from the airport. I spoke to the President on my way here, and he asked me to convey his greetings and great respect. President Trump and I believe that the relationship between the United States and Canada has never been stronger, and that is a reflection of his leadership, your leadership, and the bonds that have been forged through the generations by those who served in uniform, shoulder to shoulder. But the principal reason for my meeting today is because have a historic opportunity to strengthen the economic ties between our two nations with the passage of the USMCA. I want to assure the people of Canada that your Prime Minister drove a hard bargain, as did our President. But we believe it could be a win-win-win agreement. And we think the USMCA, which will be the largest trade deal in the history of the United States, will create jobs and opportunities in our country. It will support growth in Canada and Mexico, and all across North America. And I want to thank you personally for your engagement, for your leadership, and for the efforts that you made to bring us to this point. I also want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the progress that you're making here in ratification, in Canada. And I want to assure you that we're making energetic efforts to move approval through the Congress of the United States this summer. Beyond that, I look forward to our discussions. The United States has spoken out strongly about the arrest and detention of two Canadian citizens in China. Our relationship with China, both economic and strategic, is a real focus of both of our countries. And I look forward to our dialogue about that. But just know that we stand with you for the security of our country and yours, and for the interest of our citizens. Also, I look forward to a discussion with the Prime Minister about the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. The United States was the first nation to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela. We're grateful, Mr. Prime Minister, that Canada followed shortly thereafter. And we're especially appreciative of Canada's engagement, through the Lima Group, and continuing to stand for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. As we'll discuss, I spoke with Interim President Juan Guaidó yesterday, and the world deserves to know that the people of Venezuela are suffering, and the United States and Canada, and nations across this hemisphere and across the world, will continue to stand together until freedom is restored. There are many issues that we'll discuss. I'm very honored by your hospitality and your kindness, but I'm especially grateful that you would take time today, on the day of Game 1 of the NBA Finals , (laughter) , that will take place in Toronto. I know the Toronto Raptors are making their first appearance in the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. I think I know your loyalty, and I think you know mine. But we know it's going to be a great playoff. And I thank you again for the warm hospitality today, and look forward to our discussions.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1346177/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-and-prime-minister-trudeau-of-canada-before-bilateral-meeting&speechType=6	Foreign Affairs Trade		Ottawa, Canada	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-prime-minister-trudeau-canada-bilateral-meeting-ottawa-canada/
VSMP305201976	Mike Pence	2019-05-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence Before Canadian Council for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement Meeting	speech	VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you again for your hospitality and having the opportunity to express our appreciation to the USMCA advisory council here in Canada. President Trump asked me to be here to express our appreciation for the efforts the Prime Minister, his government, and all of you have made in fashioning what will be, for the United States, the largest trade deal in the history of our country. When the Prime Minister and I first met, I told him then that President Trump and I believe that we could negotiate a new trade agreement that would be a win, win, win for the nations across North America. And we believe that we've all done that, collectively. And I can assure you that your Prime Minister, representing all of the interests on this advisory council, drove a hard bargain. I was in on many of those discussions, and our President drove a hard bargain as well. But we really do believe that the USMCA is an idea whose time has come, and we're grateful for the progress that Parliament has already made in ratifying the agreement. And as the Prime Minister and I discussed today, our administration is working earnestly with leaders in the Congress of the United States to approve the USMCA this summer. So I'm anxious to hear your thoughts. We see the historic nature of this agreement, not only in its conventions, but issues like intellectual property, digital trade, currency policy, and labor standards have all been incorporated. And the people of Canada and the United States know that this agreement is superior to its predecessor in every way, in the interests of jobs and growth and working people and investment and all the things that we want to improve , the economies of our country and yours. So I just wanted to thank you for all of your efforts in helping to bring this about. I want to thank the Prime Minister and his entire team for the way that they worked in good faith to reach this agreement. And I'm here to pledge to you that we're going to work closely with Canada, with our neighbors in Mexico, and we're going to get the USMCA done this year.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1346178/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-before-canadian-council-for-the-us-mexico-canada-agreement-meeting&speechType=1	Foreign Affairs Trade		Ottawa, Canada	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-canadian-council-u-s-mexico-canada-agreement-meeting/
VSMP66201975	Mike Pence	2019-06-06	"Remarks by Vice President Pence at D-Day ""Final Salute"" 75th Anniversary Commemorative Ceremony"	speech	"Secretary Wilkie; Secretary Acosta; Senator Warner; Congressmen Cline, Riggleman, and Roy; our honored guests; members of the Armed Forces of the United States of America; our veterans gathered here, especially members of the greatest generation; and my fellow Americans: It is my great honor to join you here at the National D-Day Memorial alongside men who fought on this day 75 years ago. (Applause.) It's humbling to be with you all. And I thank you for your presence , joining us here to remember the service and sacrifice that triumphed over tyranny, and won back not just a continent, but a world to freedom. On June 6, 1944, they embarked on Operation Overlord, on what General Eisenhower called the ""Great Crusade."" They embarked with ""the eyes of the world"" upon them, and they sailed across the channel to the beaches of Normandy, carried aloft, as their general said, by the ""hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere."" They knew the odds. They knew the enemy. They knew the enemy would fight savagely to defend that crucial stronghold. Every soldier who stepped ashore was, as Private First Class Chuck Neighbor said, ""a visitor to hell."" But the men of D-Day pressed forward. In the chaos of battle, the bravery of men like Private First Class Hilman Prestridge and Private First Class Bill Sisk shone through. There were men like Carroll Reeves and Corporal Rover Aubrey, supplying and equipping this band of brothers as they headed for the beaches. There was Second Class Petty Officer Samuel Berry, leaping from his landing craft to swim ashore. And Second Class Petty Officer Vincent Kordack, who was caring for the wounded as bullets whistled by. All of them risked all to win a great victory. And all of them, by God's grace, are here with us today. (Applause.) To these and other D-Day veterans among us, I say: Gentlemen, you honor us with your presence. And I want to assure you, we see you not just as you are, but as you were. And seeing that, we marvel that the courage that you showed as young men when you stormed the beaches and faced the shadow of death without fear. As President Trump said today in Normandy to those who fought on D-Day, in his words, ""You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live. You are the pride of our nation and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts."" (Applause.) And today, we also think of others from this very community who were among your ranks on that fateful day. Forty-four boys who had never strayed far from home mustered out to England, and some to eternity. They were hometown folk who became national heroes. And they will forever be remembered to history as the Bedford Boys. (Applause.) Since the earliest days of our Republic, Bedford , like every other community in this land , has given its finest to defend America in battle. But for Bedford, D-Day was different. While most of this town was still asleep in bed, First Lieutenant Ray Nance was racing across the sands, dodging mortar rounds and tracer fire. While the morning bells of the Presbyterian Church were ringing, Private First Class Dickie Overstreet was nursing his wounds, along the very sea wall he had been determined to reach. While 50 women worked late in the night at the county library, rolling 9,000 bandages for our sons and brothers overseas, Technical Sergeant Ray Stevens had already fallen after leading his men onto Omaha Beach. It was only a few days later that his twin brother, Roy, found Ray's dog tags on a cross in a makeshift graveyard not far from the beach they'd both landed on. That night, the people of Bedford and all of America heard President Roosevelt ask Almighty God to ""let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come."" And they did come. On D-Day, 20 Bedford Boys with the 116th Infantry stormed Omaha beach and fell in the defense of freedom. That such a small town would make such a sacrifice seems almost beyond belief. As the author Alex Kershaw wrote, ""Theirs is the story of one small American town that went to war and died on Omaha beach."" To honor their sacrifice and the sacrifice of all those brave Americans who died on that day, this National D-Day Memorial was constructed here in Bedford as a tribute to all who gave the last full measure of devotion on the Longest Day. It is a profound honor to stand with you on this day at this memorial. But I think all of you gathered here know the true memorial to the Bedford Boys and all the courageous Americans who charged the beaches of France 75 years ago today, is our freedom , the freedom they fought and sacrificed so much to defend. (Applause.) So God bless the Bedford Boys and all the 9,388 Americans who lie in that quiet field overlooking the beaches they took 75 years ago today. God bless all the heroes forged on that day of days who fought and came home to the families and the land they love. And on this 75th Anniversary of D-Day, on behalf of a grateful nation, to those brave veterans gathered here who fought so long ago, and to all those looking on from glory, we say one more time: Thank you for your service. Thank you for our freedom. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless our armed forces. And God bless United States of America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1348900/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-d-day-final-salute-75th-anniversary-commemorative-ceremony&speechType=1	Veterans Arts, Entertainment, and History		Bedford, VA	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-d-day-final-salute-75th-anniversary-commemorative-ceremony/
VSMP66201915	Mike Pence	2019-06-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence Before Air Force Two Departure	statement	Today is a momentous day in the life of our nation as the American people watch President Trump pay tribute to the heroes that stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, 75 years ago. And today, it will be my great honor to travel to Bedford, Virginia , the community that lost more soldiers per capita on D-Day than any other community in America. I'll be speaking before the National D-Day Memorial. It'll be my great honor to pay tribute to those great heroes as well. But in the midst of that, as President Trump has made clear, we have a crisis on our southern border. Last week, the President took decisive action to call on Mexico to do more. In the month of May alone, the American people learned yesterday, 144,000 people were apprehended attempting to cross our southern border. The time has come for Mexico to do more to stem the tide of illegal immigrants that are making their way north from Central American through Mexico and coming into our country. And the President has taken a strong stand. We'll continue to take that strong stand until Mexico takes such action as is necessary to address this crisis and bring this crisis of illegal immigration at our border to an end. At the President's direction, we welcomed the Mexican delegation to the White House yesterday. We're grateful that the Mexican delegation came forward with proposals. It was a good discussion. We welcome what Mexican put on the table , but, as the President said yesterday, it's not nearly enough. A hundred and forty-four thousand people apprehended in the month of May. A hundred thousand of those apprehended are families , people that are bringing children in the hopes of being able to exploit the loopholes in our immigration laws. And our message to the Mexican delegation and our message to the Mexican government is the time has come for Mexico to act decisively to work with the United States of America to assist us in enforcing our laws by enforcing their laws, by securing their border. And we made clear to them that President Trump is going to continue to stand firm until we bring this crisis of illegal immigration at our southern border to an end. Discussions will continue today at the State Department. The Secretary of State's team, as well as White House officials, will be meeting with the Mexican delegation. But again, I say: The meeting yesterday was positive. We welcomed the efforts of the Mexican officials to offer solutions to the crisis at our southern border, but we need Mexico to do more. And our hope is, as these discussions continue, that Mexico will step up, will take such action that is necessary to address what the American people know is a real humanitarian and security crisis at the southern border of the United States.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1348895/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-before-air-force-two-departure&speechType=6	National Security Foreign Affairs Immigration		Prince George's County, MD	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-air-force-two-departure/
VSMP136201974	Mike Pence	2019-06-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the RiverStone Health Clinic	speech	"Well, thank you, Senator Daines. Thank you all for being here today. Please be seated. It's my great honor to be here in Montana today with your senator, with your congressman, with all the leaders who are working every day to end the scourge of drug abuse and addiction here in Montana. And we will do this for the people of this great state and this nation. (Applause.) It's my great privilege to be here on behalf of President Trump. I spoke to him this morning, told him I was headed to Montana to speak on this vitally important issue. The President put it well. He said our administration, from its first day, would be committed to, in his words, ""liberating our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction once and for all."" And we are absolutely committed to this cause. And I want to reflect today on the progress that we have been making. And I want to recognize the people who are with us today who are making such an incredible difference here in the lives of families that have been caught up in drug abuse and addiction here in Montana. First and foremost, he is an author of critical legislation, the Child Protection and Family Support Act. He's making an incredible difference , not just telling Montana's story, but telling the story of drug abuse and addiction all over this country. Would you join me in thanking Senator Steve Daines for the great work that he's done. (Applause.) And his great partner on Capitol Hill, Congressman Greg Gianforte. I want to thank you, Congressman, for your strong support of this issue and on behalf , not just the people of Montana but people all across this country. Thank you for your partnership. (Applause.) I'm honored to be joined today by your U.S. Attorney, Kurt Alme, who works this region for the Department of Justice. Kurt, we thank you for your great leadership and your great words in a briefing today, and all that you're doing to bring to justice those that are profiting from tearing apart the lives of our families here in this region. I also want to thank our host today here at RiverStone Health Clinic, the Rimrock Foundation. I want to thank your CEO, Lenette Kosovich. Would you give all these people that are really putting hands and feet on the compassion of the American people here in this great organization every day? Thank you all. (Applause.) And as I just heard, Kristin just spoke some really powerful words in the back as we talked about stories of families here in Montana, children now fortunately in foster care who've received the aid of social services here in this state, who have benefitted by aggressive law enforcement that's taken place, and now are on a new path in their lives and their families. But Kristin , Kristin spoke some words that really moved my heart. And I want to say to all of you, as she just said to us: Montana, I know you have been beset in particular by meth abuse and addiction. According to the HIDTA Task Force commanders here in Montana, this state has seen methamphetamine , by far, the most prevalent drug in this state , it has driven offenses by more than 300 percent over the last four years. We just heard about impacts on Indian reservations nearby where property crimes, crimes against persons are skyrocketing in the last four years. But I want to speak a word of hope and confidence about the progress we're making together. As Kristin just said: We can turn this around, Montana. (Applause.) And we will for the sake of our families and our state and our nation. And I believe we are turning it around. And I believe we are turning it around. The moving stories that Kristin just shared with me, the fresh start in children's lives. And it's remarkable to think that some 80 percent of children that are entering the foster care system here in Montana are the result of families caught up in drug abuse and addiction. And the vast majority of that is methamphetamine. And I'm here to tell you that working , working with our partners here across the state of Montana, working with your great delegation in Washington, D.C., we are bringing a whole-of-government and a whole-of-community approach to confronting this challenge. And I want to assure you that we'll continue to do just that. The truth is, it will take a combination , as Senator Daines just said so well , of education, of law enforcement, and also healthcare treatment, intervening and coming alongside people that have been caught up in the grip of drug abuse and addiction. And we're doing all of that. It all really does begin with moments like today where we have an opportunity for our neighbors and friends to know what's happening, to understand, if this hasn't impacted their family, it's impacted people that they know. I literally just got a phone call this week from a dear friend in Ohio who lost his son to a drug overdose this week. Wonderful young man. The last report I got about him was that he'd been , he'd been clean for a year and a half. But then I got word that he lost his boy. And I called him up, and we wept together on the phone. And Karen and I prayed through last week as he laid his son to rest. There's stories like that all over this state. And the human cost is real. And I want to assure you that we're bringing the full resources of the federal government to bear against those who would profit from the drug trade and bring such heartache to our families and our communities. And we're especially proud of what's known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program. HIDTA is making a difference here in Montana. And we are grateful for the service represented by all of you in this room. (Applause.) I'm proud to say the HIDTA program has forged an unprecedented cooperation between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement officials from the FBI, the DEA, to city police chiefs like the chief that's here with us today and county sheriffs. And it's made an incredible difference. The HIDTA program, working with local law enforcement, has been intervening as never before. In our first year in office, I'm proud to report, men and women of HIDTA , many of whom are with us here today , broke up smuggling rings with ties to major transnational criminal organizations; disrupted and dismantled more than 2,700 drug trafficking and laundering organizations. And, all told, HIDTA helped seize more than $16 billion in illegal drugs that were stopped from making their way to our communities and to our families and our children. So on behalf of your President, on behalf of the American people, I say to all the men and women of HIDTA here in Montana: Thank you for your service. You're making a difference. (Applause.) And we'll continue to make that difference. We'll continue to surge resources and partner with courageous law enforcement personnel like those I just heard from a few short moments ago. But the truth is, as Senator Daines said so well , and I heard him say it on Capitol Hill in a forum where many of the members of the Senate were gathered , here in Montana, it's important to understand that you're a northern border state with a southern border problem. Because when you look at the tremendous flow of methamphetamine, which is highly toxic, highly purified, that vast majority of that is moving across our southern border from Mexico. And as people here in Montana know , and this President and our administration know , we have a crisis at our southern border. In the month of May alone, 144,000 people came across our southern border illegally and were apprehended, or turned themselves into border agents and made asylum claims. A hundred thousand of those people were actually families with children , dependent children , with them. This is placing an enormous burden on our law enforcement personnel at our border. And those are simply the people that we apprehended or turned themselves in. The truth is, with that kind of a burden on our border, as the Senator and I have discussed, it creates all new opportunities for drug cartels and drug organizations to seize the opportunity in that system and try and move even more drugs. So I'm very proud to report to you, thanks to President Trump's strong stand, in just the last few days, we have secured an agreement from Mexico to do more than ever before to support our efforts to secure our border. (Applause.) The President made it clear a little less than two weeks ago. He said Mexico must do more or we would have to take actions that would involve the imposition of tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico. It was my privilege to be a part of those negotiations. And, as I stand before you today, I'm proud to report, thanks to the President's leadership, Mexico has agreed to allow all Central Americans that come across our border and claim asylums to remain in Mexico , not within our system, within the United States or vanishing into the United States, but to remain in Mexico while they're being processed. And just as important, Mexico has agreed to deploy 6,000 of their National Guard to their southern border to enforce their laws. This is more than Mexico has ever done before. And it is going to help solve the humanitarian crisis at our border, and it's going to make it more possible for us to confront the scourge of drugs coming north from Mexico. (Applause.) We have every confidence. But it's not all that we've done. The truth is, not only the HIDTA program but a broad range of efforts in this administration have continued to be deployed. And I'm pleased to report to you that literally within a month of taking office, the President signed an executive order that empowered law enforcement to undermine transnational drug cartels and criminal organizations. We signed a historic opioid bill that your members of Congress and the House and the Senate supported, giving more than $1 billion to our state and local partners to combat opioid abuse and addiction. We rewarded hundreds of millions of dollars to community health centers and organizations that are treating people all across this country. We've laid out a national drug control strategy. And I want to add , and I want to add, working with Senator Steve Daines, President Trump signed into law the Child Protection and Family Support Act that your senator authored that makes it possible for moms and dads who are recovering from drug abuse and addiction to keep their children at their side and have a better chance at success. And, Senator Daines, I want to thank you for that historic legislation. (Applause.) In fact, later today, in just a few moments, I'll be joining my wife, Karen, as we visit the Willow Way House. And we're going to spend some time with some courageous moms and their kids at Willow Way House that are on the road to recovery with the support of their children around them. And I can't wait to meet them and give them a hug, and make sure they know that we're there for them. Because that's my last thought to all of you. I want to assure you that this President and I also know that, while law enforcement is essential , and we're going to continue from the border north, to continue here in Montana to bring the full weight of law enforcement in partnership with local law enforcement officials, with tribal law enforcement officials, to do everything in our power to bring to justice those that are profiting from the drug trade that's tearing apart our families. I want you to know we understand that we can't arrest our way out of this problem. We've got to provide remedies and opportunities for rehabilitation and healthcare to people that are willing to take that first step away from the grip of drug abuse and addiction. And that's my other message. If I have two messages today, the first one would be: If you're involved in selling drugs to people here in Montana, we are going to find you and we are going to stop you. (Applause.) And my second message is: If you are caught up in drug abuse and addiction, in the grip of addiction here in Montana, there is help. The people of this state and this nation want to put their arms around you and help you restart your life free of drug addiction. (Applause.) Institutions like this great institution that we're gathered at today , RiverStone Health Clinic; the Rimrock Foundation, all the great work that's done here, the great social work that's done; the Willow Way House that I'll be visiting in just a few minutes, it's , we get it, we understand. We got to be there to come alongside , come alongside families like Senator Daines's legislation just did to make it possible for people to have a pathway to be successful, to step away from drug abuse and addiction. And people need to understand that there is help and there is a way forward. There's a way out of the darkness and the grip of drug abuse and addiction. So let me thank all of you for your courageous work. I came here today to make sure that people across Montana know that we're with you and we're going to continue to stand with you until we bring this epidemic, this plague of meth abuse, of drug abuse to an end, here in this state and all across this nation. But I also came here to say thank you, particularly to those of you who are coming alongside vulnerable families, rescuing children out of harm's way, bringing them into a foster care system. Those of you that are providing healthcare to people that have the courage to be able to step forward and choose a better and brighter path in their lives. And also to say thank you to the courageous men and women who put your lives on the line every day, who step into harm's way without regard to your personal safety. You consider our lives more important than your own. Whether you be in HIDTA, whether you be in local law enforcement here in Billings, tribal law enforcement, and state and local officials, or our great federal team, I just want to say thank you. And to all of you, from the bottom of my heart, on behalf of your President and on behalf of the American people, I just want to assure you that we're with you, and we're going to stay with you. We can do this. And the more I meet people around this country that are in this fight every day, the more confident that I am that the day will come, as the President said, when we liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction, when we end this scourge and this crisis. Because I'm confident, that with your continued work, with your continued courageous service in law enforcement, with the continued compassion of healthcare professionals and social professionals, and with God's help, we'll make our communities and our nation safe and free of drug abuse and addiction. Thank you all very much. God bless you. And keep up the great work, Montana.

VSMP136201973	Mike Pence	2019-06-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence During Briefing from the HIDTA Task Force and the Yellowstone Substance Abuse Coal ...	speech	To Senator Daines and Congressman Gianforte; to General Fox; and to Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan with HHS; to the members of the law enforcement community here in Montana; and everyone here at RiverStone Health Clinic: Thank you so much for making time out today to brief us on the challenges and the opportunities and the progress that we're making combatting drug abuse and addiction here in Montana. I spoke to the President this morning, and I know how grateful he is for the efforts that all of you are making here in Montana. And I just , I want to pass along his and my admiration and appreciation for the unique challenges that you face here, particularly, as it pertains to meth. It is remarkable to think of the fact that nearly 200 people lose their lives every day to drug overdose in this country. We have literally an epidemic of drug abuse and addiction. But here in Montana , as Senator Daines has helped take to the national level , we recognize that the challenges that you face with meth have presented a unique burden on families and in communities with heartbreaking results, and also driving not only health challenges, but law enforcement challenges. It's remarkable to think meth offenses skyrocketed by more than 300 percent here in Montana over the last five years. Meth-related DUIs have increased by 300 percent as well. All that being said, I know that all of you are on the frontlines. And it's the reason why I wanted to start my visit in Montana with each and every one of you, because we're here to help. And this President has taken decisive action, with the strong support of your delegation in Congress, to address the meth crisis here in Montana, and also to address the root causes. I remember I was at a meeting on Capitol Hill when Senator Daines spoke about meth making its way across the southern border of the United States and how quickly it would be here in Billings, and impacting families, and driving drug abuse and addiction here in Montana. And I want to commend you for the legislation that you authored and this President was pleased to sign. We'll be visiting a very special facility later today that , because of Senator Daines's work and Congressman Gianforte's support, that we've been able to now give people treatment, and to be able to stay with their families as they're treated for drug abuse and addiction. I'm also pleased to report to you that, as a result of the strong stand that President Trump took just two weeks ago, that Mexico is now poised to do more than they've ever done before to secure our southern border. We reached an agreement for Mexico to deploy 6,000 of their National Guard to their southern border, to have checkpoints throughout Mexico, to intervene when people or nefarious trade is making its way through their country. And also, we arrived at an agreement that allows us to return 100 percent of all the Central Americans who come across our southern border seeking asylum , to have them remain in Mexico while they're being processed. We believe that this will contribute significantly to alleviating the crisis at our southern border and allowing our Customs and Border Protection personnel to be able to be even more effective in interdicting the drugs coming across our border. I mean, we have a crisis at our southern border. It is , 144,000 people came into our country illegally and applied for asylum in the month of May alone. And those are just the people that either turned themselves in or were apprehended. But as the law enforcement community here in Montana knows and understands, those are just the people that we caught. And that volume of people coming across our border simply gives the drug cartels even greater opportunity to move meth and other drugs across our southern border. So I want assure you that this new agreement, we believe, is going to contribute not just to ending the crisis at our southern border, but we believe that as a result of President Trump's strong leadership and the agreement we reached with Mexico, that it's going to contribute to our ability to impact the flow of drugs into our country, across the southern border and that make their way here to Montana as well. We're building a wall. We're providing additional resources. We're working with the Congress, as we speak, to provide even more support at our southern border. But it's important that people in Montana know that we don't have just a crisis at our southern border. We have a crisis at our southern border that's creating and contributing to a drug epidemic all across our country. And I want to assure you that we're going to continue to work earnestly to secure our border. We're going to continue to partner with the HIDTA program and other programs all across this country, with local law enforcement, to address this issue. We want to be tough on those that are profiting from the sale of drugs that are tearing apart our families and our communities. And we'll continue to do that, but we also recognize that we can't arrest our way out of this problem. And I really do want to, again, commend RiverStone Health Clinic and all of the communities that are really coming alongside families that are caught up in drug abuse and addiction here in Montana. But I'm here to learn more about how we can even provide more support to the great state and local leadership that's represented here. I want to thank you all for your time. I look forward to your presentation. And, Senator Daines, thank you again for inviting me to Montana. And thank you for your leadership on the national stage , not just to confront drug abuse and addiction here in Montana, but to make it more possible for us to be more effective and to really bring more help to families all across this country. The President and I are truly grateful.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1350952/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-during-briefing-from-the-hidta-task-force-and-the-yellowstone-substance-abuse-coalition&speechType=1	National Security Drugs Immigration		Billings, MT	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-briefing-hidta-task-force-yellowstone-substance-abuse-coalition-billings-mt/
VSMP286201972	Mike Pence	2019-06-28	Remarks by Vice President Pence to the National Intrepid Center of Excellence Staff and Patients	speech	"Well, thank you. And would you all join me in giving a big round of applause to Captain Greenhalgh for the great work he does here? Thank you. (Applause.) I want to thank Captain Greenhalgh. I want to thank Colonel Gonzalez. But, mostly, I just came here in the presence of these two members of the United States Senate , one Republican and one Democrat , to say that all of the American people are grateful for the work that you do here at the Intrepid Center for Excellence. Today is National PTSD Awareness Day, and today the American people recognize that there are some 500,000 veterans who struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder. There was a time more than 10 years ago that we failed to recognize these challenges. But I'm so proud that here at Walter Reed, where we give America's best to America's best, that we are leaning into this effort and really setting the pace. I'm also very encouraged, Captain, to learn that the National Intrepid Center for Excellence is being replicated at bases around the country. It is important, as we see to the physical needs of men and women who have worn the uniform and gone into harm's way, that we deal every bit as much with the emotional and psychological and mental challenges that they carry home. The invisible wounds scar our veterans almost as much as the physical wounds. And we're recognizing that as a nation. And for my part, and on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief , who I just spoke to a few moments ago , I came here to say thank-you on National PTSD Awareness Day. Thank you for what you're doing to really come alongside to provide innovative therapies and treatments to our veterans. You're making an incredible difference. The men and women who have put their lives on the line for us are benefiting by the care that they're receiving here at the Intrepid Center and, frankly, at facilities like this all over the country. I want to thank Senator Manchin and Senator Sullivan for their singular leadership on this issue. Both of them serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee and have brought a resolution to the floor of the Senate today, which recognizes National PTSD Awareness Day. And join me in thanking both of these senators for their great leadership to our veterans. (Applause.) In addition to saying thank-you to all of you, we're simply here to send a word out to anyone who has worn the uniform of the United States, who's struggling with or thinks you may be struggling with PTSD, to say, ""There's help."" Help is available. And the American people are here to stand with you. We're far past the time of a stigma being associated with the emotional or psychological scars that are left by those who serve in combat. And to any of those within the sound of my voice, or their family members, who sense that that veteran who lives with them or that service member who lives with them is struggling with PTSD, we ask you to talk with them. Talk to them. And to our veterans and to our members of the service, talk to your loved ones, talk to your caregivers, and know that we're going to be redoubling our efforts to make sure that just as in places like Walter Reed, we see to the physical needs of those who have served and defended our nation, that we will continue to redouble our efforts to meet the emotional needs of those who have stepped up and counted our lives more valuable than their own. It's particularly moving to me, as I walked around today and talked to some of these courageous service members who are here , we could give them a round of applause, the folks who have been with us (inaudible). (Applause.) It's the strong men and women who proved it again by coming here to the Intrepid Center and having the courage to confront the challenges and burdens that they face. But as I said before, it was a different time in days past. My dad was a combat veteran in the Korean War. And it wasn't until I became an adult that my mother shared with us that, for the first 10 years of their marriage, my dad struggled: Woke up in the middle of the night. Then, we didn't understand it. But to those that are struggling with PTSD, just know that we understand now. We're here for you, and we're here to help. So with that, finally, just thank you to all the caregivers who are here. I love it when I come to Walter Reed because I really do know that I'm meeting America's best caregivers giving your best to our finest every day. And so thank you for your service to the country. Thank you for your service to those who serve. And just God bless you as you continue the great, great work here at the Intrepid Center for Excellence. Thank you all. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354454/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-to-the-national-intrepid-center-of-excellence-staff-and-patients&speechType=1	Veterans Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-national-intrepid-center-excellence-staff-patients/
VSMP47201971	Mike Pence	2019-07-04	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Naturalization Ceremony	speech	"Thank you, Secretary Chao. Thank you for those gracious words, but for your inspiring personal story and for sharing this moment with us today. To Senator Lankford, to Congressman Turner, to Congressman Meadows, to our Acting Director Cuccinelli, to archivist David Ferriero, to members of the National Archives Board: It is deeply humbling for Karen and me to be with you today, here in this place, on the hallowed ground of our National Archives to celebrate the Fourth of July with 44 new Americans. (Applause.) Congratulations to you all. It is amazing to be standing here today before all of you and to be able to extend the welcome of the American people to your new place in this nation as citizens. And it's remarkable to think of the journey you've travelled on. You come from 26 different countries. We heard them called in the roll , Bolivia and Morocco, Vietnam, Mexico, and Afghanistan. I'm also told you come from just about every walk of life. There's an electrician among you. A banker. There's a college counselor, an IT engineer, and even an Uber driver. (Laughter.) But all of you aspired to be Americans. You stepped forward. You followed the law. You went through the process to immigrate into this great nation. And as of today, the men and women gathered before me today who just raised their right hand have now joined the ranks of the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. (Applause.) But the 44 of you and your families are hardly alone. Last year, more than three-quarters of a million people raised their right hand and swore the very same oath that you just took. And your example and theirs gives evidence that then, as now, and throughout our nation's history, America has the most generous system of legal immigration in the history of the world. And we are proud to have you join our ranks. (Applause.) Now, as fellow Americans, you'll be a part of many debates in the life of this nation, including debates over immigration in America. And we all know that our current system of immigration faces real challenges. But to those of you who step forward today, who made the sacrifices and went through the process, let me say, on behalf of President Donald Trump and on behalf of the American people: Welcome to the American family. (Applause.) But like those who have spoken before, it is humbling to stand before you. But it's almost indescribable for this American to be flanked by these extraordinary documents. Because here, we are surrounded by the three great founding documents of this great nation: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights. That very Constitution that you just swore an oath to uphold and defend is behind me as we speak. And it was forged in the fires of the American founding. It is remarkable to think of the courage and tenacity of those who crafted these documents. And on a day like today, as we look at their images on the walls above us, I think it's important that we remember their story. When we study history, we often forget that those who were living it didn't know what was on the next page. And they risked all. The signers of the Declaration of Independence, 56 delegates to the Continental Congress that adopted that Declaration of Independence 243 years ago today pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. And it was not just words. It's remarkable to think that when those 56 delegates signed that Declaration of Independence, the largest city in America then had a population of 40,000 people, and that was the City of Philadelphia. And at the very moment that those delegates were asked to sign their names to that document, an armada of British soldiers, 32,000 in strength, was sailing into New York Harbor with one order , and that was to put down the rebellion in the American colonies. In fact, history records that anyone who was to sign a Declaration of Independence, by order of the King, was to be hanged by the neck until they were dead. They risked all for us and for you to be able to have this moment. By the end of the Revolutionary War, of the 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence, five were captured by the British Army during war; many lost family members; and many were left destitute and impoverished, even though they came from some of the most prosperous families in the colonies before the war. I mean, the very idea that the Continental Army, which was led by a man who had never commanded more than 2,000 troops would be able to defeat the army of the most powerful empire on the planet was unthinkable. In fact, when the British did finally surrender to George Washington at Yorktown, after six long years of war, all the military band could think to play was a song entitled, ""The World Turned Upside Down,"" for surely it was. In the early years, they forged freedom. First, with an Articles of Confederation, and then with this extraordinary Constitution and Bill of Rights. There is that famed story that, at the close of the Constitutional Convention, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, a woman approached him and asked these words, ""Well, Doctor, what have we got , a republic or a monarchy?"" And Benjamin Franklin replied, echoing into history, ""A republic, madam, if you can keep it."" And so we have. With the adoption of the Bill of Rights and in all of the many years since, we've kept it. And now it's yours. You're inheriting a legacy purchased at a high price. Men and women through the generations have risked all, have laid down their lives, to ensure the continued success and vitality of the document , or the government forged in these documents. And now, in those stirring words of the oath you took, now it's also yours to support and uphold and defend, if necessary. It's a remarkable thing. To the new Americans gathered here, I submit that, as you continue to study the history of your new home, you will learn that , over more than two centuries of the American experiment, that freedom is not for the faint of heart. It requires vigilance and sacrifice and sacrifice on behalf of the citizens to maintain it. And as you, you yourselves, have demonstrated even up to this moment, as we cherish our freedom, our freedom continues to inspire the world: millions, over the generations , now who you've joined , who've come to these shores and nations around the world who aspire to be like us. Well, you've heard stories from this podium about immigrant families from the nation's Archivist, from the Secretary. But I'll tell you one more story. It was on April 11th, 1923, that an Irish immigrant named Richard Michael Cawley stepped off the boat onto Ellis Island In New York City. He immigrated to this country. He became an American citizen. He took the train to New York City. He drove a bus for 40 years and raised a wonderful family. The story of his family was a story of , has a legend that his mother walked him across the street from their modest home in Ireland, and walked him up the hill, and pointed in the direction of the Ox Mountains and to the West, and said, ""You have to go to America because there's a future there for you."" Well, I stand before you today as that future. That man was my grandfather and I'm his namesake. He raised a precocious redhead up there in Chicago, and she married a fast-talking salesman who built a gas station business down in a small town in Indiana. And that's where I and my three brothers and two sisters showed up. On the day that I raised my right hand, just a few years ago, and took part of the oath you just took to serve in the role in which I'm privileged to serve right now, I had many things in my heart and mind that day. But my mind kept going back to my grandfather, to his courage to be able to leave everything behind, everything he knew , family, and hearth, and home , and come here because it was a future, because he believed in the American Dream. And I was up on that platform, just down the street by the Capitol Building, in January of 2017, thinking that Richard Michael Cawley and his courage is the only reason that Michael Richard Pence became the 48th Vice President of the United States. (Applause.) I share that with you just to encourage you because we all know the sacrifices that you've made , not just to become citizens, but to join us. And we commend you for it. But now, as your Vice President and as a fellow American, let me at least leave you with this charge: You have become citizens in the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. But as the Good Book says, ""To whom much is given, much will be required."" So be prepared to exercise your prerogatives as free men and women, as citizens of the United States of America, in a way that will benefit your family, your community, your state, and your nation throughout your life. Find a way to give back for all that you've been given. Raise a great family. Build a business. Be a good neighbor. Be a teacher. Be a public servant. Put on the uniform of law enforcement. Volunteer at a local service club. Be a schoolteacher. Or even serve in elected office. Live out your commitment to this country by creating more opportunity for your family and your fellow citizens. Live out the oath that you took today by contributing to the life of this nation, and use your newfound citizenship for good , for your good, and for the good of the United States of America. In so doing, I promise you, you will have paid back all that's been bequeathed to you if you live a great American life. You've made a remarkable journey to arrive at this moment, and I know that you and your loved ones will forever cherish this day. So will we. Today, with this solemn and sacred oath, taken on these hallowed grounds, you've sworn to exercise and uphold the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. You've inherited a legacy of liberty that generations of Americans have paid for with their lives. And this legacy is now yours. Serve it well. And remember, finally: Dream big. There are no dreams too big in the land of free and the home of the brave. And you are now citizens of that great nation. So live your dreams for the sake of yourselves, your families, your children, and your children's children. Go prosper because, in America, the sky is the limit. So once again, allow me and my wife to offer our heartfelt congratulations and welcome to 44 new American citizens. May God bless you even as he blesses the United States of America. (Applause.)END"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1355061/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-a-naturalization-ceremony&speechType=1	Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-naturalization-ceremony/
VSMP127201970	Mike Pence	2019-07-12	Opening Remarks by Vice President Pence at Roundtable Discussion with U.S. Border Patrol and Members of the Senate ...	speech	"Well, thank you all for being here. It's my honor to be with you all and to have the opportunity to see firsthand the extraordinary and compassionate professionalism of Customs and Border Protection. We literally just came from another facility, and , the Donna soft-sided processing facility. And while we hear some Democrats in Washington, D.C. referring to U.S. Customs and Border facilities as ""concentration camps,"" what we saw today was a facility that is providing care that every American would be proud of. And I want to thank all of those serving in Customs and Border Protection for your professionalism and for your compassion for the families that are swept up in this crisis. Now, President Trump asked me to be here today , and not just to say thanks, but also to make it possible (inaudible) led by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham, and a member of Congress to see firsthand the work that you are doing. And the President also took steps to make sure that the American people could see what's happening here. It's time that we moved past the harsh rhetoric of the American Left and we move to the facts. And the facts are, is we have a crisis on our southern border that is being driven by human traffickers who are exploiting loopholes in American law to entice vulnerable families to make the long and dangerous journey north. I have to tell you, for Karen and me, it was frankly heartbreaking, as parents, to talk to young children who told us of having walked two and three months up the peninsula to cross into our country. And that has to change. And I know I speak on behalf of the President and millions of Americans, Senator Graham and all of the senators, and a member who is here from the House of Representatives, when I say we are grateful for your efforts in supporting border security. We are grateful for the humanitarian support that we are able to move on a bipartisan basis. And we're also especially grateful, Senator Graham, for your efforts in attempting to move legislation that will close the loopholes, that will end catch-and-release. It is remarkable to think that roughly a thousand people that we just visited at the Donna processing facility will literally all be released into the United States within the next 20 days because of current court orders, and law, and processes that are in place. These families have been subject to abuse, in many cases, on the way north. Doctors Without Borders has documented that 30 percent of the young women that make the long and dangerous journey north are sexually assaulted. We have a moral obligation to reform our asylum laws and bring this crisis of illegal immigration to an end. But let me again thank Senator Graham; as well as Senator John Cornyn, from here in Texas; Senator Mike Lee; Senator Marsha Blackburn; Senator Rob Portman; Senator Thom Tillis; Senator Josh Hawley; and Congressman Tom Rice for taking time to come here and see for yourself what's happening. We know each one of you is going to carry back this experience , not only at the Donna processing facility, but here at the McAllen station , to carry that into the debate, to call on the Congress to make the changes that we know they need to make. I also want to thank Acting Secretary McAleenan and all of the leadership here for the work that you're doing each and every day. It's important to remember that the Border Patrol , the Border Patrol's job is to secure the border. It's to apprehend people that are trying to come into this country illegally and to prevent the flow of illegal drugs that are coming across our southern border and tearing apart our families and our communities. But here in the Rio Grande Valley, increasingly, our Customs and Border Protection personnel are caught up in this massive migration that we'll witness again today when we tour this facility. But this time, we'll bring the American people with us. And I believe that they will see that, despite the fact that many Democrats in Washington say this is a ""manufactured crisis,"" the crisis is real. And the time for action is now. And the President and I are going to continue to call on the Congress to step up and end this crisis by bringing about changes in the law that will be necessary and will impact the flow , not only here in the Rio Grande Valley, where some 60 percent of the apprehensions and detentions are taking place, but also all across our southern border. The American people , the American people are accustomed to harsh rhetoric out of Washington, D.C., and seeing politicians playing fast and loose with facts. But it seems like it's been particularly true in this case. For the last six months, President Trump and I have been saying that we have a crisis on our southern border. The good news is that there's now a consensus in Washington, D.C., that a crisis exists. But rather than pointing fingers and grandstanding on Capitol Hill , that we saw again today , I want to make it clear: The President and I are ready to roll our sleeves up and work with men and women in both political parties in the Congress to bring about the changes that will bring an end to this crisis. What the American people are going to see today , as we toured the Donna facility and as we toured the facility here in McAllen, we'll confirm two things: The crisis is real. This is not a manufactured crisis. And it'll also prove that despite what they have heard in the harsh political rhetoric in Washington, D.C., that the men and women of Customs and Border Protection are doing an honorable and compassionate job in an overwhelming situation. I expect we will see, here at McAllen, that this facility is overcrowded. That will be evidence that this crisis is real. Make no mistake about it, the President and I are going to continue to provide each of you who wear the uniform and do the work here in McAllen and throughout the Rio Grande Valley with the support and the resources you need to do your job to secure the border, to provide humanitarian detention to the those who come into our country illegally. But let me say again to Senator Graham, to all the members of Congress and the Senate who are here with us today: The time for action is now and we couldn't be more grateful that you've dedicated the time and your energies and your leadership to help advance the kind of reforms that will bring this crisis on our southern border to an end.

VSMP187201969	Mike Pence	2019-07-18	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2nd Annual Religious Freedom Ministerial	speech	"Well, Ambassador Brownback, Your Excellencies, and to all of those who have struggled under religious persecution: You honor us by your presence, all. Welcome. Welcome to the second Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. And welcome to the largest human rights ministerial ever held at the United States State Department. (Applause.) We gather today as people who believe in freedom of religion and also the power of faith. As Vice President of the United States, I stand for the freedom of religion that animated the American founding and is enshrined in our Bill of Rights. But this is a special day for me as well because, on a personal level, my faith in Jesus Christ has brought meaning and purpose to me and my family every day of my life. So I'm honored by your presence, and I'm especially honored to address you today as Vice President to an American President who has been a great champion of religious freedom at home and abroad. So allow me to begin by bringing greetings and welcome on behalf of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Since the earliest days of our nation, America has stood for religious freedom. Our first settlers left their homes and all they knew for the chance to, as the said, ""Begin the world [all] over again."" They carved protections for religious liberty into the founding charters of our nation and our very earliest laws. And after our independence was won, the crafters of America's Constitution enshrined religious liberty as the first of our American freedoms. Our Declaration of Independence proclaims that our precious liberties are not the gift of government, but rather they're the unalienable rights endowed by our Creator. Americans believe that people should live by the dictates of their conscience, not the diktats of government. And we're proud , proud that our long tradition of inspiring other nations to embrace religious freedom and respect for human rights has ushered in important improvements in the lives of people all over the world. And I want to take this opportunity to thank , to thank the distinguished representatives of the 106 countries who have chosen to be here today to join us in taking a strong stand in defense of religious freedom. Free minds build free markets. And wherever religious liberty is allowed to take root, it is prosperity and peace that ultimately flourish as well. And as we tell even our closest allies, those who reject religious freedom are more likely to breed radicalism and resentment; that it can sow those seeds of violence and it can too often cross borders. And those who deny religious freedom to their own people often have few qualms denying those rights to others. That's why, under President Trump's leadership, this administration has taken decisive action to defend our first freedom at home and abroad. The President made a bold statement in support of religious liberty when he appointed a friend and a lifelong champion of our first freedom as our Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. And that man has now traveled the world, and his good work is evidenced in the historic turnout today. Would you all join me in recognizing and thanking Ambassador Sam Brownback for his work on behalf of religious liberty around the world? (Applause.) Thank you, Sam. And earlier this year, our administration built on that progress by appointing Elan Carr as the Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism. And earlier today, as you all heard, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new initiative to create a forum for dialogue about religious liberty around the world, and we look forward to working with each of you in the newly instituted International Religious Freedom Alliance. And with this renewed focus on religious liberty, we've stood with those who are oppressed for their religious beliefs around the world, since the first days of this administration. Three years ago, an American pastor was arrested in Turkey and imprisoned for the alleged crime of ""dividing and separating"" the nation simply by spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ. In one meeting after another with President Erdoğan, I saw President Trump demand the release of this good man of faith. Through two years of imprisonment, we stood strong. And in October of last year, through the President's efforts and by God's great kindness, Pastor Andrew Brunson came home. (Applause.) Pastor Brunson's story of perseverance in the face of incredible hardship was an inspiration to people across our country and believers around the world. And we express our admiration to him from the bottom of our hearts, being an example of faith that is ""like gold tested in fire."" I understand he is with us today. He is my friend. So let me just say, Pastor Brunson, welcome home. (Applause.) It is good to be back with you for the second year in a row. Last year, it was my great honor to address the first ministerial, where I announced two initiatives and, I'm proud to report, have made great progress. We announced a new initiative to ensure that religious freedom and religious pluralism would prosper across the Middle East: the Genocide Recovery and Persecution Response Program. And to date, I'm proud to report the United States has provided more than $340 million in aid to faith and ethnic minority communities persecuted by ISIS in Iraq and throughout the region. Second, at that ministerial, we announced a new initiative to support those who fight for religious freedom and those who suffer from religious persecution: the International Religious Freedom Fund. And since then, we've received nearly $5 million in pledges, with donors from several countries well represented here. With your support, we've provided more than 435 rapid response grants to those persecuted because of their beliefs, helping more than 1,800 people directly, as well as their families and fellow believers. For example, in Sri Lanka, we've given much-needed assistance to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. And as I said last year, America is proud to lead this program, but we ask all the nations gathered here and around the world to join us in this important fund. Together, we will champion the cause of liberty as never before, and I believe that our combined leadership will make a difference for religious liberty for generations to come. So we've made progress, but we still have much work to do. For, as we gather here today, a stunning 83 percent of the world's population live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or even banned. The victims of religious persecution face economic sanctions. They're often arrested and imprisoned. They're the target of mob violence and state-sanctioned terror. And all too often, those whose beliefs run counter to their rulers face not just persecution but death. The list of religious freedom violators is long; their oppressions span the globe. Here in our hemisphere, in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega and his Vice President and wife Rosario Murillo continue their assault on faith and human rights. Their regime violently suppresses dissent, assaults opponents, and condones thugs who repress and intimidate Catholic Church leaders for defending democracy and religious freedom. In Venezuela, the dictator Nicolás Maduro is using his so-called ""anti-hate"" laws to prosecute Catholic clergy who speak out against his brutal regime that has impoverished millions in this once-prosperous country. Jewish community leaders report that media associated with the Maduro regime often cast coverage of Israel in anti-Semitic tones and trivialize or even deny the Holocaust. Nicolás Maduro has brought nothing but misery to the people of Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolás Maduro must go. (Applause.) At President Trump's direction, the United States was proud to be the first nation on Earth to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela. And since then, we're grateful that more than 50 nations have joined us in this cause, including Greece, just last week, which became the 55th nation to recognize Interim President Juan Guaidó. So we're standing strong for free and democratic Venezuela. We're also calling out the persecution of religious minorities in the greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Iranian people enjoy few, if any, freedoms , least of all, the freedom of religion. Christians, Jews, Sunnis, Bahá'ís, and other religious minorities are denied the most basic rights enjoyed by the Shia majority. And believers are routinely fined, flogged, and arrested in Iran. Like a story of a courageous Christian pastor whose daughter is here with us today. In 2009, Iranian authorities shut down Pastor Victor Bet Tamraz's church. But instead of fleeing the country, he continued to share the good news. In 2017, the Iranian government sentenced him to 10 years in prison. And in 2018, they sentenced his wife to five years, and later, they charged the couple's son to four months in prison for ""spreading Christian propaganda."" Pastor Bet Tamraz and his family are an inspiration to freedom-loving people the world over, and we couldn't be more honored to have his daughter Dabrina here with us today. Please join me in recognizing Dabrina Bet Tamraz. (Applause.) Of course, Iran's leaders aren't content to persecute only their own people. They routinely export violence and terrorism throughout the region, including to their neighbors in Iraq. To this day, Iranian-backed militias extort and terrorize the people of the Nineveh plain, which is still recovering from the days of ISIS's brutal reign. Now, let me be clear: The United States will not stand idly by while Iranian-backed militias spread terror. And today I'm announcing that the United States has placed sanctions on two leaders of Iranian-backed militias for all they've done. We will hold them accountable. (Applause.) But the people of the United States of America have a message to the long-suffering people of Iran: Even as we stand strong against the leaders in Tehran, know that we are with you. We pray for you. And we urge you to press on with courage in the cause of freedom and a peaceful and prosperous future for your people. So we're standing up to the regime in Tehran. We're also standing up for the persecuted Rohingya people in Burma. While that conflict has fallen along ethnic lines, we cannot ignore the rise of militant Buddhism against Muslim and Christian minorities that's taken place. A brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya has forced more than 700,000 to flee across the border to Bangladesh. And though the United States has repeatedly urged the Burmese government to hold accountable all those responsible, the government has continued to imprison and harass innocent men and women. Like a young Rohingya woman who is here with us today. When she was just 18 years old, she was thrown in jail for the simple crime of being the daughter of a political activist who dared to challenge the old military regime. For seven years, she and her family endured deplorable conditions, but they never lost faith in the freedom that was their birthright. Eventually, she was released. And since then, she's gone on to earn a law degree and a master's of laws from the University of California-Berkeley. Now, she's a leading advocate of empowering women and girls all over the world. She's an inspiring woman, and we're honored to have her with us today. Please join me in recognizing Wai Wai Nu. Thank you for your example and your leadership. (Applause.) The United States has urged the Burmese government to hold accountable those responsible and make it clear that these mass atrocities must never happen again. But, so far, our words of admonition have seemed to fall on deaf ears. And that's why this week, the United States of America placed visa sanctions on Burma's top two military leaders , the commander in chief and his deputy , as well as two commanders of light infantry brigades. We will hold them accountable. (Applause.) So we're standing up to the malign regime in Iran and pressing for accountability in Burma, but the United States has also spoken out against religious persecution in the People's Republic of China. And we do so again today. China's oppression of Tibetan Buddhists goes back decades. As part of its efforts to oppress Tibetan Buddhism, back in 1995, Chinese authorities captured the legitimate Panchen Lama, then just a 6-year-old boy, and neither he nor his family have been heard from in the 24 years since. And in Xinjiang, the Communist Party has imprisoned more than a million Chinese Muslims, including Uighurs, in internment camps where they endure around-the-clock brainwashing. Survivors of the camps have described their experiences as a deliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith. Religious persecution in China has also targeted the Christian faith. But in one of the greatest ironies in the history of Christianity, in today's Communist China, we actually see the fastest growth in the Christian faith that we have ever seen anywhere on Earth in the last 2,000 years. Just 70 years ago, when the Communist Party took power, there were fewer than half a million Chinese Christians. Yet today, just two generations later, faith in Jesus Christ has reached as many as 130 million Chinese Christians. The truth is, faith is breaking out all across China , even in the streets of Hong Kong. As the pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai told me earlier this month, when young people encounter police in the streets during the protest marches that have drawn millions, he said those young people often sing songs of worship and praise. As he said, they sing, ""Hallelujah to the Lord."" Chinese authorities may ban the sale of Christian Bibles, but that hasn't stopped China from publishing more Christian Bibles than any other country on Earth. Chinese authorities may ban the construction of Christian churches, but that hasn't prevented China from building more Christian churches than any other country in the world. China's experience is just more evidence of a time-worn truth: The pathway through persecution lies in the faith and resilience of the persecuted. Like that of a pastor of a large, unregistered church in Guizhou, China. On December 9, 2015, Pastor Su Tianfu was placed under house arrest after Chinese law enforcement raided the Living Stone Church. Later, he and his fellow co-pastor were charged a fine of up to a million dollars for collecting illegal donations from their church parishioners. And just last year, he was sentenced to one year in prison. His courage in the face of such relentless persecution is an inspiration to freedom-loving people all over the world. And we're honored to have with us today his courageous wife, who has been with him every step of the way. So join me in recognizing Manping Ouyang. We are honored that you are with us today. And we are inspired by your faith. (Applause.) The United States is engaged in ongoing negotiations and discussions over our trading relationship with China. And those will continue. But whatever comes of our negotiations with Beijing, you can be assured, the American people will always stand in solidarity with the people of all faiths in the People's Republic of China. And we will pray for the day that they can live out their faith freely, without fear of persecution. But for all of the challenges that believers face in China, the treatment of people of faith in North Korea is much worse. As the United Nations Commission on Human Rights reported, and I quote, ""The violations of human rights in the DPRK constitute crimes against humanity the gravity, scale, and nature of which has no parallel in the contemporary world."" Open Doors has identified North Korea as the world's worst persecutor of Christians for the past 18 years. The North Korean regime formally demands that its officials act to, in their words, ""wipe out the seed of [Christian] reactionaries."" And possession of a Bible is a capital offense. So you can be confident, as President Trump continues to pursue the denuclearization of North Korea and a lasting peace, the United States will continue to stand for the freedom of religion of all people of all faiths on the Korean Peninsula. (Applause.) The United States stands with all victims of religious persecution. And the America people have them in our hearts and in our prayers, whether it be North Korea, China, Burma, Iran, or all around the world. But today, I'd also like to draw attention to four men who have faced down enormous pressure to stay true to their faith and whose release, even now after a long captivity, would help restore the reputation of the countries that have detained them. In Eritrea, the 90-year-old patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Abune Antonios, continues an already 12-year-long house arrest because he refuses to ex-communicate critics of the government in his church. In Mauritania, the blogger Mohamed Cheikh Mkhaïtir, is still being held for criticizing the government's use of Islam to justify discrimination. In Pakistan, Professor Junaid Hafeez remains in solitary confinement on unsubstantiated charges of blasphemy. And in Saudi Arabia, blogger Raif Badawi is still in prison for the alleged crime of ""criticizing Islam through electronic means."" All four of these men have stood in defense of religious liberty, in the exercise of their faith, despite unimaginable pressure. And the American people stand with them. And so, today, the United States of America calls upon the governments of Eritrea, Mauritania, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia to respect the rights of conscience of these men, and let these men go. (Applause.) While religious freedom is always in danger in authoritarian regimes, threats to religious minorities, sadly, are not confined to autocracies or dictatorships. The truth is, they can and do arise in free societies, as well, not from government persecution, but from prejudice. In Europe, where religious freedom was born as a principle and is enshrined in law, anti-Semitism is on the rise. In France and Germany, things have gotten so bad that Jewish religious leaders have warned their followers not to wear kippahs in public for fear that they could be violently attacked. And attacks on Jews, even on aged Holocaust survivors, are growing at an alarming rate. Regrettably, the world's oldest hatred has even found a voice in the halls of our United States Congress. So let me say it clearly: Anti-Semitism is not just wrong; it's evil. And anti-Semitism must be confronted and denounced wherever and whenever it arises, and it must be universally condemned. (Applause.) I met just this last week with Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein from Chabad of Poway, the California synagogue that was the scene of a tragic shooting in April of this year. He was still wearing the bandage from a wound he suffered during the attack. His courage was incredible. And while I was there, I also met the hero who chased the assailant out of the synagogue. And meeting him only confirmed in me in an old truth that faith inspires heroes. That's why faith always triumphs. But to all of the victims of persecution who are here with us today, know this: The American people are with you. We are with you. The people of the United States are inspired by your testimony and by your strength. And it steels our resolve to stand for religious liberty in the years ahead. The American people will always cherish religious freedom. And we will always stand with people across the world who take a stand for their faith. We've gathered here, 106 nations strong, because we believe in the freedom of conscience, the right of all people to live out their lives according to their deeply held religious beliefs. We're here today because we are, and will forever remain, dedicated to the principle that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, and among them are life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are not the birthright of Americans; they , they're the birthright of the human race. And I promise you, under this President, we will always respect the sovereignty and diverse cultures of every nation in the world, but as we do, America will continue to aspire to be that city on a hill that John Winthrop wrote about so long ago. We'll always continue to stand for the freedom to live, to work, and worship according to the dictates of your conscience. And freedom of religion will always be an American anthem. And so, today, I thank you for being present here today, for the many nations represented here, and for your solidarity with us and your determination in your nations to advance the cause of religious liberty. I leave here today with renewed confidence as I see all of you. And, properly, I close with faith , faith that we will make progress on behalf of religious liberty in the years ahead. You know, inscribed on the Liberty Bell, which was given to the United States of America by France shortly after we won our independence, are ancient words. It reads: ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land [and] unto all the inhabitants thereof."" Americans and liberty-loving people throughout the world and throughout our history have done this. And I believe with all of my heart that as each of us in all of the nations represented here renews our commitment to proclaim liberty throughout all our lands, that all faiths and freedom itself will flourish, for ""where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."" So thank you all. Thank you for your stand. And may God bless all who yearn for freedom and labor beneath persecution for their faith. May God bless all of your nations. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)

VSMP207201968	Mike Pence	2019-07-20	Remarks by Vice President Pence Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing | Kennedy Space Cen ...	speech	"Governor Ron DeSantis, First Lady Casey, Administrator Bridenstine, Director Cabana, General Selva, distinguished members of Congress, Marillyn Hewson, the dedicated men and women of NASA, and especially Rick Armstrong and the members of the Neil Armstrong family, and Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin: It is my great honor to be here with all of you today. (Applause.) It's great to be back here at the John F. Kennedy Space Center, as Vice President and as Chairman of the National Space Council, with my wonderful wife Karen, to celebrate , (applause) , to celebrate with all of you the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing a half a century ago that will be remembered forever. (Applause.) And I've been looking forward to this day, but allow me to bring greetings from another great space enthusiast and a great champion of American leadership in space. I begin today by bringing greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Today, our nation pays tribute to the three brave astronauts who sat atop a 360-foot rocket that lifted off from Pad 39A 50 years ago this week , two of whom walked on the moon 50 years ago today. We also gather to pay tribute to the nearly 400,000 Americans , engineers, technicians, designers , whose sacrifices and dedication made it possible for Apollo 11 to complete what another president called ""the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind has ever embarked."" Let's hear it for all those who supported these three brave astronauts 50 years ago. (Applause.) When President Kennedy challenged the nation in 1961 to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth before the decade was out, it's important to remember that our country was not yet ready to meet that challenge. We didn't have the rockets or the launch pads, or the spacesuits or the lander. We hadn't even invented many of the materials or tools that we would need. Not only did we not have what we needed, we didn't even know what we needed. But President Kennedy summarized that epic endeavor in one simple sentence: ""We choose to go to the moon."" And make no mistake about it: The moon was a choice. An American choice. (Applause.) And like every time the American people make up their mind, once that decision was made, American ingenuity, grit, and determination , the achievement was inevitable. The only challenges that remained were challenges of engineering and science. The moon didn't come easily, and it didn't come without costs. And it did not come without grave danger or without sacrifice. To this day, Americans grieve the loss of three brave astronauts of Apollo 1 who were lost in a fire on the launchpad in January of 1967. And we think of them and their families even today. The risks for Apollo were so great, the odds were so long, that many feared that even if our astronauts made it to the moon, they might not make it back. In fact, history records that President Nixon prepared a speech in the event of a tragedy, where he would explain to the nation that the mission had failed. But, of course, the mission didn't fail. After all , with 400,000 men and women behind the mission at NASA, and with the hearts and prayers of the American people , how could it fail? (Applause.) For at the controls of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, known as Eagle, stood two great Americans: Mission Commander Neil Armstrong and a man who is with us today, Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin. (Applause.) And circling overhead in lunar orbit was Command Module pilot Michael Collins. (Applause.) Just picture it: Fifty years ago today, at almost exactly this hour, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were about halfway into their powered descent on the final leg of their landing on the moon. There they were, standing beside one another in a capsule not much bigger than a couple of telephone booths, just minutes from touchdown. They thought they were ready for every contingency. After all, as Buzz told me just a few days ago, they had spent two years intensively training for this moment, and they'd run almost 600 simulated landings all designed to be more difficult than the real thing. Eagle had just finished its rollover to position itself for final approach, when all of the sudden, Neil Armstrong called out to Houston that Eagle had a ""1202 Alarm."" The problem was nobody on board or in Houston had any idea what a ""1202 Alarm"" was. Eagle's flight computer was overloading. Not only could they not see the moon out their windows; they couldn't know for certain how far they were from the surface. Not a good way to fly. And yet, how calm they were. Working with the team back here on Earth, they quickly resolved the problem without betraying the slightest anxiety. People all over the world were watching, with no idea that anything had gone wrong. That, my friends, is what they used to call the ""Right Stuff."" (Laughter.) You know, there's a reason Neil Armstrong, as well, was called the ""Ice Commander"" in his day. When the original landing area turned out to be so full of large boulders that landing there would have doomed the mission and the crew, history records that Neil Armstrong calmly took control of the Lunar Module, skimmed along the top of the surface of the moon in search for a safe place to touch down. And by the time he found a safe spot, known to all of us as Tranquility Base, Armstrong and Aldrin had only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. Like every one of my generation, I remember that day. Six hundred million people around the world were watching their TVs and listening to their radios, waiting with admiration, anxiety, and wonder. And I was one of them , a little boy sitting in front of our black-and-white television in the basement of our home in Indiana. When those first snowy images of Neil Armstrong stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder beamed down to Earth at 10:56 p.m. on Sunday, July 20, 1969, they made an indelible mark , not just on my imagination, but on the imagination of my generation and every generation to come. It was a moment so rich in meaning that, upon hearing Neil Armstrong's first call from Tranquility Base, even the era's greatest newsman, Walter Cronkite, could only shake his head and utter two words: ""Oh, boy."" All at once, the nation held its breath , as through the crackling broadcast we listened to, we heard Neil Armstrong use those immortal words: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" In that moment, the men of Apollo 11 did more than help expand our understanding of Creation, and they did more than win the Space Race. They brought together our nation. And for one brief moment, all the people of the world were truly one. Now, true to their creed, astronauts have never liked the idea of being called heroes. Yet for all they did , and for all the risks they took , if Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes. We honor these men today, and America will always honor our Apollo astronauts. (Applause.) They were heroes all. (Applause.) We honor the men of Apollo 11 by remembering their epic voyage and telling their story. But we also honor them by continuing the work they so nobly and courageously advanced in American space exploration. Apollo 11 was followed by five more successful moon missions culminating in the final historic journey of Apollo 17 , America's last trip to the moon. As we honor our Apollo 11 astronauts, we are also honored today to be joined by Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmidt. Thank you for your courageous service. (Applause.) As Harrison and I have discussed about his mission, while the last words spoken on the moon might not be as well-known as the first words, his fellow astronaut Gene Cernan said more perhaps than anyone could've known at the time. It was a challenge to our time. As he stepped off the moon on December 17, 1972, Gene , he said these words, and I quote, ""As I take man's last steps on the moon for some time to come, history will record that America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow."" And then he ended by saying, ""We leave the moon as we came and, God willing we shall soon return with peace and hope for all mankind."" (Applause.) Those were words of challenge in 1972. And in our time, as President Trump said, this generation of Americans knows that it is ""America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown."" And standing before you today, I am proud to report, at the direction of the President of the United States of America, America will return to the moon within the next five years, and the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts. (Applause.) We're going back. After more than 45 years, where one administration after another chose to limit America's space program to low Earth orbit, President Donald Trump has changed all that. Early in this administration, the President revived the National Space Council within the White House to coordinate all space-related activities across the government, including matters related to national security. And we've been hard at work. The Space Council has helped bring together skilled leaders in business and industry to revive and renew America's commitment to human space exploration. And I'm pleased that many members of our Users' Advisory Group for the Space Council are with us today for this historic occasion. Join me in welcoming these dedicated and distinguished Americans. (Applause.) The President also signed Space Policy Directive 1, ""challenging NASA to lead the return of Americans to the moon, send the first Americans to Mars, and enable humans to expand and deepen our reach across the solar system."" It is our mission. And as I speak to you today, I'm proud to report we're investing in new rockets, new spaceships. We're working with private companies around this country to develop the new technologies of the future by unleashing the burgeoning private space industry that dots the landscape of this historic center and this nation. And within the next year, we will once again send American astronauts into space on American rockets, from American soil. (Applause.) Already, we've given our human exploration missions a newfound sense of urgency not seen in more than a generation. And, last year, NASA and American innovators began an accelerated design process for both the lunar orbital gateway and the lunar surface base , all of which we will need to support Americans on the moon and to train and prepare to send Americans to Mars. And while we've made great strides in advancing the President's bold vision for space , unlike in years past, we will have the budgets to match it. And that's why I'm especially grateful today to be joined by some of the greatest champions of American leadership in space in the Congress of the United States: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Congressman Robert Aderholt, Congressman Brian Babin, Congressman Bill Posey, and other distinguished members of Congress. Would you please rise and allow us to express our appreciation for your strong support of renewed American leadership? (Applause.) With strong bipartisan support, this President has already signed into law the largest NASA budget ever. And on this historic occasion, I'm told that we've also achieved a critical milestone in our effort to go to the moon and beyond. Today, thanks to the hard work of the men of NASA , men and women of NASA and of American industry, the Orion crew vehicle for the Artemis 1 mission is complete and ready to begin preparations for its historic first flight. (Applause.) In the coming years, American astronauts will return to the moon aboard the Orion, and they'll return with new ambitions. We will spend weeks and months, not days and hours, on the lunar surface. This time we're going to the moon to stay , and to explore and develop new technologies. We will extract water from ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the South Pole. We will fly on a new generation of spacecraft that will enable us to reach Mars, not in years but in months. Americans are leading in space once again. And today we're reminded , we're reminded how American leadership 50 years ago, and the accomplishment of Apollo 11, inspired our nation. As the President said, it ""ignited our sense of adventure"" and ""steeled our belief that no dream is impossible, no matter how lofty or challenging."" And as Buzz Aldrin said today, in his words, ""Looking back, landing on the moon wasn't just our job, it was a historic opportunity to prove to the world America's can-do spirit."" (Applause.) But as we lead in human space exploration again, we'll carry not only American ingenuity and pride, but most importantly, we'll carry America's ideals into the vast expanse of space , ideals of freedom and liberty. Apollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969 will likely be a date that will live in the minds and imaginations of men and women, as long as there are men and women to remember , across this world, across this solar system, and beyond. So, today, we remember the heroes of Apollo 11 and all the heroes that supported them in their mission , some 400,000 Americans. But today, we also reaffirm our commitment to ""unlock the mysteries of space"" and to lead. And as we continue on this American journey, we go with the same resolve and determination of those who have gone before. And we go with faith. Faith in the courage of this new generation of astronauts , men and women of the character and caliber of those who have gone before. They're remarkable pioneers who will carry American leadership into space. Faith in the ingenuity of the men and women of NASA and all of those across the American space enterprise, whose creativity and tireless efforts in the days ahead will match that of their forebears who created and invented new ways to explore and expanded human understanding with American leadership. And finally, I believe, as we go forward , and as millions of Americans believe in their hearts, and have throughout the generations , that we'll go forward with faith that as those pioneers put on the spacesuits and climb aboard the rockets, that we'll believe that even if they rise on the wings of the dawn, even if they go up to heavens, that even there His hand will guide them, and His right hand will hold them fast. And that'll be our prayer. Today, we mark the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. We celebrate the heroic astronauts who accomplished that extraordinary feat in human history , and all those who supported them. And today, we resolve, for the sake of all they accomplished, that America will lead in space once again. And this nation will once again astonish the world with the heights we reach and the wonders we achieve. So may God bless the crew of Apollo 11 and all who supported them on their historic journey. May God bless this new generation of pioneers and all who will support them. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. (Applause.) Thank you.

VSMP237201967	Mike Pence	2019-07-23	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement | Ankeny, IA	speech	"Well, hello, Iowa. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you for that warm welcome. To Governor Kim Reynolds, to Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg. I'm also told we're joined by Iowa's former First Lady. Chris Branstad is with us today. Chris, take a bow, will you? (Applause.) Great to have you home. State Senate Majority Whip Amy Sinclair. And, of course, to Roger Hargens and the amazing men and women of Accumold, it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State. Thank you all for having us today. (Applause.) Thank you. Governor, thank you. And it's great to be here with some friends in public and private life who have been partnering with this administration to promote American manufacturing, to promote agriculture at home and abroad. And speaking of friends of mine, I was talking to a friend of mine this morning. I told him I was headed to Iowa and I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings and admiration from a man who loves the state of Iowa and who's been fighting every day to keep Iowa growing. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Now, before I begin about the topic of the day, let me just take a moment to say a word about your governor. I want to thank Kim Reynolds for her outstanding leadership for this stat, but most especially for the way that she and your entire community of first responders stepped forward in the historic flooding this March. Governor, the nation was impressed, and you should be proud of the way Iowa responded to these historic floods. And we are going to stay with you every step of the way until these communities come all the way back. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor. Great job. You know, it is an honor for me to serve as your Vice President alongside a President who gets up every day and fights to keep the promises that he made to the people of Iowa. From our very first day in office, this President promised that we were going to get this economy growing again, that we were going to raise wages for working Americans, that we were going to revive the American economy. And that's just what we've done: 6 million new jobs created by businesses just like this one and unemployment is at a 50-year low. (Applause.) But you know, I hail from the Hoosier State , an awful lot like Iowa. And in Iowa and Indiana, the truth is, we do two things particularly well: We make things and we grow things. And this President has a real heart for manufacturing. In fact, President Trump has been working hard to revive American manufacturing since the first day of this administration. And with the strong support of our partners in the Congress, in two and a half years we've been doing just that. You know, this President has already signed more laws rolling back federal red tape on businesses just like this one than any administration in American history. We've unleashed American energy. And this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We cut taxes for working families, for family farmers, and we cut taxes for businesses large and small so companies just like Accumold can compete and win against companies anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And the results have been remarkable. Since Election Day 2016, as I mentioned, we've created millions of new jobs all across this country, including, I'm proud to report, 49,000 new jobs right here in the state of Iowa. Well done, Iowa business. (Applause.) I mentioned the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. And, here in Iowa, it is an astonishing 2.4 percent. And most important of all, I know, to this President, to our administration, and to your governor, is that after years where wages seemed just stuck in up to the axle and not growing at the pace that America has needed to keep ahead and to get ahead, now wages are rising at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years. And most exciting of all, wages are rising the most rapidly among blue-collar, hardworking Americans. The way we put it: The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) This economy is working for everybody. It's true. And when it comes to manufacturing: Since Election Day 2016, manufacturing companies across this country have created more than 500,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs like you have right here at Accumold, including 15,000 manufacturing jobs right here in the Hawkeye State. You know, 2018 was actually the best year for manufacturing job creation in more than 20 years. And, frankly, it's a credit to people like all of you who make companies like this work each and every day. Businesses are investing and growing here in Iowa and around America because of your work ethic, because of your professionalism. And you're to be commended. It is remarkable to think of the stories of American businesses just like this one. The story of Accumold is one worth telling. This is a company that started in a rented garage, I'm told. It was a rented garage. It wasn't even your garage. (Laughter.) In those early days, that little room, the founders of this company came up with a new way of manufacturing small, complex component parts for high-tech industries , medical devices and electronics. Thirty-five years later, Accumold, from those humble beginnings, now employs 350 people right here in Iowa. It's another great American story of success and innovation. Congratulations. (Applause.) But I know from talking to Roger, he understands that the success of Accumold is only made possible because of its people , each and every one of you , like a couple people that I want to mention today: a man who has served in the Army Reserves for 15 years, who has used his skills to serve his country in Afghanistan as an aircraft electrician. And now he's using those very same skills here to build up this company and build up Iowa's economy. Would you join me in showing our appreciation, for his service and his professionalism, to Jeff Hancock? Jeff, where are you? (Applause.) Thanks, Jeff. And thanks for your service. Another man who was born in Mexico and moved to Iowa when he was 10 years old is with us today. He attended Des Moines Area Community College on a scholarship and then joined the team here at Accumold, I'm told, about four years ago. He just got married , (laughter) , and in just the last two months, he became a father. And together with his brother Francisco, he works here at Accumold. And he just became an American citizen. Would you join me in congratulating a new dad, a new American: Yanni and Francisco Sanchez. Where are you? (Applause.) You know, these folks are just emblematic of, really, all of you in this room. I mean, truthfully, we're renewing American manufacturing because of all of you , because of your worth ethic, your integrity, and your hard work. And because of who you are, companies like Accumold are thriving all over Iowa and all over America. So give yourselves a round of applause. This is your success story. Great job. (Applause.) So I came here today to express the admiration of the President and our administration for this great company and for the success that you've enjoyed here because of all your hard work. But I also came here today to ask for your help. Because for all the progress that we've made , all the jobs that have been created in manufacturing and in every area across Iowa , the truth is that that's just what this businessman-turned-President calls a ""good start."" To keep the American economy moving, President Trump and I know not only do we have to roll back red tape and cut taxes, unleash American energy, but we've got to have trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And that's what the USMCA is all about. (Applause.) It's true. It's true. From the very outset of this administration, with dealing with Europe or the Indo-Pacific, we've been working to negotiate deals that are promoting free, fair, and, as the President likes to say, reciprocal trade , where we say to our trading partners around the world that we'll deal with you in the same way that you deal with us. For too long, the United States had one-sided trade agreements. Countries were able to manufacture goods or grow products and ship them into the United States with very few limitations, when nevertheless we faced barriers and tariffs as we tried to export to their countries. And we've made progress around the world in opening up markets to manufactured goods and our agricultural products that are made and grown here in Iowa. But I came here to Iowa to send one message , one message and one message only , today: Iowa and America need the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. The time has come for Congress to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) It'd mean a lot. It would mean a lot to the Iowa economy and a lot of businesses just like this one. I've been traveling all over the country talking about the USMCA over the last several months. You know, in , according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is actually going to add more than 175,000 jobs to our economy once it puts into effect. Sixty-eight billion dollars to our economy just in the initial estimates. And that includes nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs that we expect to be created right out of the gate. And that same estimate tells us that the USMCA will increase wages for American manufacturing workers. This job is a win for American workers, and Congress needs to pass it to the President's desk. (Applause.) Now, the governor and I were chatting on the plane on the way here, and she told us that Iowa exports about $12 billion in goods around the world, and half of that is exported to Mexico and Canada. And it's really amazing. And under the USMCA, I promise you, Iowa, that's only going to grow. It's going to create more jobs, more opportunity, and more prosperity right here in Iowa as we open up opportunities to expand new technologies, to expand agricultural products to Canada and Mexico. It's amazing to think that one out of every eight Iowa jobs depends on exports. And that's not news to me because I , as I said, I come from the Hoosier State, where our economy is , it shares very much the same traditions as you have here in Iowa. What you make here, what you grow here, you send to the world. But as I mentioned, nearly 50 percent of all Iowa exports go to Mexico and Canada, including 50 percent of all agricultural goods and 50 percent of all manufacturing goods. If we pass the USMCA, Iowa's workers and farmers are going to win like never before. But we got to get it done. The clock is ticking. For Iowa and America, Congress needs to approve the USMCA, and Congress needs to approve the USMCA this year. 2019 is when we have to get it done. (Applause.) And I watched this President drive a hard bargain, and I was in on a lot of those calls and a lot of those meetings with Mexico and with Canada. I mean, those of you that know a little bit about dairy know that Canada had set into motion some policies that were working a real disadvantage to American dairy. And I wish you could have been there. I wish you could have been a fly on the wall to watch the way this President fought and demanded that we level the playing field for agriculture and particularly for dairy, when it came to Canada. But the truth is, the President and our team have done our jobs. It's time for Congress to do their job. And so I'm going to ask you to do us a favor here. I want you to talk, here in Iowa, about what the USMCA is going to mean to companies just like this. I mean, talk to Roger. Talk to folks in this company about the incredible technology that you build here and already send around the world, and the impact that this trade agreement is going to have , and not just on our exports to Canada and to Mexico. But truthfully, when we pass the largest trade deal in American history, it's also going to be the most modern trade deal in American history. And as our negotiations continue to move forward with Japan for a free trade agreement; with the EU; with the UK, after Brexit is done; and most especially with China , make no mistake about it: The USMCA is going to provide a framework for the kind of trade deal that's going to put American jobs and American workers first in the 21st century. So I want you to go out and tell the story. I mean, you can just say, ""Hey, I went to work the other day and I ran into Mike"" , (laughter) , ""and he said he flew all the way to Iowa because he's just really excited about the USMCA. And he told us it's going to make it possible for this company to keep growing, for this community to keep growing, and to keep doing all the kind of things that Accumold does every day way outside these walls."" You know, this is a great company. It's not only got a great success story, but Roger Hargens, the whole team here , Accumold is a great corporate citizen that supports causes all across this community and all across Iowa. And that only becomes more possible as the company continues to grow. So talk to your neighbors and friends. Let your voice be heard. And I think we'll get USMCA done, and we'll get it done this year. Now, I encourage you to reach out to elected officials in the House of Representatives who represent you here from Iowa, in particular. But let me say with some gratitude, you don't need to call Senator Chuck Grassley or Senator Joni Ernst because they are already leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate. (Applause.) They are great leaders and we're grateful to both of them. But call your congressman, and tell him, ""Hey, I work at a great company , a company that makes the most incredible, high-tech medical devices the world has ever seen. And this is going to expand opportunities in our company to continue to grow, continue to create jobs, and continue to raise wages."" I'd also say to you, since I'm in Iowa, I understand that a lot of candidates are making their way through Iowa these days. (Laughter.) You know? I mean, it's that time of year, isn't it? And Iowa is that first-in-the-nation state. Let me tell you, I think , I know the people of Iowa take that responsibility to heart. But I hope you also take it as an opportunity. Because, right now, you deserve to know that every single Democrat running for President is opposed to the USMCA. So, Iowa, you should let your voice be heard with the people that are coming to visit this state. You should remind these candidates for the highest office in the land that 50 percent of all exports from Iowa go to Mexico and Canada. Remind them that this trade deal has the strongest protections not just for jobs but for American workers and for the environment in the history of trade deals. Tell them that Iowa needs the USMCA and they need to get behind the USMCA now. Iowa needs it. America needs it. Tell them it's time to get it done this year. (Applause.) We've got a great opportunity. I know you've got a great opportunity, Iowa, and I know you're not bashful around here. So let them know how you feel. It'll make a difference. Don't doubt it for a second. And finally, just let your voice be heard in the public debate. I mean, a letter to the editor, going on social media, call a local talk show , just talk to them about , about what this really means. Because the truth of the matter is, this is ultimately going to be driven by the American people. And if the American people from here in Iowa and all across this country will send a clear message to Capitol Hill that we want Congress to get it done, Congress will get the USMCA done and they'll get it done this year. So let your voice be heard, Iowa, in every way possible. It'll make a difference. (Applause.) So thanks for coming out today. I want to thank , I want to thank Roger. I want to thank the whole team here at Accumold for such a warm, wonderful welcome. I want to thank your great governor for the job that she's doing for the people of Iowa every day and all the other officials who are here. And I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits before they whisk me away back to Washington, D.C. But let me just leave here with a promise to each one of you. I promise you we're going to continue to work our hearts out to bring this USMCA across the finish line. It's going to make a real difference for Iowa, and it's going to make a real difference for America. And there'll be plenty of credit to go around. The truth is, the President and I have been reaching across the aisle to Democrats in the House and the Senate. And I'm glad to report that many Democrats have already come out. Many Democrats have already come out with their support for this trade agreement. The truth is, we all need to weigh in. And there'll be plenty of credit to go around. And it'll be a win not for one party; it'll be a win for America when the USMCA gets done. And I'm just going to leave here and promise you that we're going to work hard on that. We're going to keep fighting for all the policies that Iowa voted to advance in that election back in 2016. We're going to keep working to make this economy more prosperous again. We're going to keep working to make Iowa safer than ever before. We're going to keep working so companies like Accumold can reach heights that they never even imagined. And I just am confident that, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with great leadership at the state level like Governor Kim Reynolds, with hardworking Americans like you at great companies like this, and with God's help, we're going to keep making America great again. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. God bless Iowa. And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP267201966	Mike Pence	2019-07-26	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Miller Electric Company | Jacksonville, FL	speech	"Well, hello, Jacksonville! (Applause.) To Governor DeSantis; to David Long, and leaders in business and industry; to my friend, Ivanka Trump; especially to the men and women of this remarkable company: It is great to be here among so many hardworking Americans at a growing company, in a growing state, in a growing America. Let's hear it for Miller Electric and the great state of Florida. (Applause.) It's great to be here among so many friends that are making such a difference in the life of this economy, in Jacksonville, in this state, in this nation. And speaking of friends, allow me to get started today by bringing greetings from a friend of mine and a man who I know loves the state of Florida and who's fighting every day for hardworking Americans. I bring you greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And I mentioned her before, and you've heard from her, but I have to tell you, it's a special joy for me to be on the road today with really a great champion for working families. She's a successful entrepreneur, she's represented our country around the world, and she's been working tirelessly to promote job training for people all across this country. Would you join me in showing one more round of applause for the Senior Advisor to the President of the United States, Ivanka Trump? (Applause.) Thanks, everybody. You know, from the very first day of this administration, President Trump promised the American people that we were going to hire and grow America; that we were going to work to raise wages for American workers, and help rebuild this nation's economy. And President Donald Trump has been delivering on that promise every single day. In just two and a half years, this President has actually signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. We've unleashed American energy and now we're a net exporter of oil and natural gas to the world. We've had free and fair trade deals being negotiated, including the USMCA that goes before Congress soon. And this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. That's what we call promises made and promises kept, Florida. (Applause.) It's true. And the results , I don't have to tell you in this growing state, but the results have been nothing less than amazing. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small have literally created 6 million new jobs, including nearly 510,000 new jobs right here in Florida. And you all know the economy of the Sunshine State is booming, and it's thanks in no small part to the leadership of your new governor. You may not realize it, but the people of Florida are actually creating jobs at a faster rate than the national average. And in the past year alone, the labor force in Florida has grown by 124,000 people, and businesses have created 200,000 jobs in Florida alone. Prosperity and opportunity are spreading all across this state. So it's no wonder why your new governor is already one of the most popular governors in the United States of America. Would you join me in thanking Governor Ron DeSantis on a great start and a job well done? (Applause.) Great job. Well, it's amazing, this economy is roaring. Not only 6 million new jobs, but the unemployment rate across America has hit a nearly 50-year low. And the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans has hit the lowest level ever recorded. Wages are rising at their fastest pace in nearly a decade. And I know it means most , the most to the President and me. And when you look at those wages rising, they're actually rising at the fastest rate for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more, Florida. It's the truth. (Applause.) And President Donald Trump and I are committed to ensuring that this historic prosperity reaches into every American home. And that's why we're here today. And that's why we wanted to see firsthand this extraordinary apprenticeship program that Miller has put into effect. You know, President Trump and I believe that all honest work is honorable and that Americans students and workers of every age, income, and background should have the chance to pursue their dreams and succeed and thrive according to their abilities and their ambitions. So I'm here today to talk about our administration's efforts to give more Americans access to the education and training they need to fill the good-paying jobs, like right here at Miller. You know, it's important to note, as we gather here today, that thanks to this President's leadership and our strong supporters around the country and here in Florida, there are actually more job openings in America today than there are people looking for work. Recent studies actually have shown that nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will be created in America in the next decade, and some two-thirds of those jobs could go unfilled if we don't have the job training and the vocational education that we need. Workers in the skilled trades in particular are hard to come by in today's economy. It's a reality. Electricians, welders, and machinists, you all should know, you're are in high demand. But too few Americans these days are pursuing these valuable career paths. And I'm sure all of you here at Miller Electric know, because this company is a pretty rare company. I saw firsthand, when I was serving as governor to the state of Indiana, when companies like this one work with the government at every level to expand vocational education, everybody wins. And we can expand opportunities for working Americans as never before. And that's just what we're doing. In this administration, I want to assure you we're absolutely committed to making sure that every American has access to the kind of education that will make your dreams come true. That's why this President has taken decisive action to make job training and vocational education easier and more accessible than ever before. In our first year in office, for instance, the President expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help all Americans adapt to the ever-changing 21st century economy. Last July, the President established what we call the National Council for the American Worker to continue to develop policies that will expand opportunities for every American, particularly in the various trades and skilled trades. And last year, President Trump launched what we call the Pledge to America's Workers to encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training American workers for American jobs. And he tasked his own , our own Ivanka Trump to lead that effort. By signing the Pledge to American Workers, companies are committing to create new opportunities over the next five years for students and workers through apprenticeships, continuing education, and on-the-job training just like you have here at Miller Electric. When the Pledge to America's Workers was launched, the first-year goal was 500,000 job opportunities. And in the past year, with Ivanka Trump in the lead, and members of our Cabinet have traveled relentlessly around the country meeting with businesses large and small to promote career education. Yesterday, was the one-year anniversary of the Pledge to American Workers. And I'm proud to announce to you that we didn't hit 500,000 job opportunities; we actually hit 12 million job training opportunities for more than 300 companies. (Applause.) Incredible. Twelve million. And Governor DeSantis, I'm proud to say, that includes 70 companies all across the state of Florida that have stepped up and pledged to create nearly 75,000 job training opportunities for people across this great state. You know, that, again, is what we call promises made and promises kept. And I'm proud to report that hundreds of those opportunities will be created by our host today. So on behalf of the people of Florida, the people of Jacksonville, and people all across this country, let me just say thank you to Miller Electric for committing to the future and to jobs and opportunities for people here in Jacksonville. Great job, Henry. (Applause.) You know, looking out at all of you and meeting a lot of the folks going through the training program here, I couldn't be more impressed with Miller Electric, with this storied company and its storied history here in Jacksonville. This is a great company that believes in investing in hardworking Floridians. And Henry and the team here are doing just that by participating in this program. Today, Miller Electric, I'm told, employs more than 500 apprentices across the country, combining technical training with on-the-job experiences for new employees in this company. In fact, in just the first few months of this year, I'm told that Miller Electric has already enrolled 85 new members in your apprenticeship program here in Northeast Florida, nearly 15 percent more than the year before. That's a real commitment to making it possible for people in this community to get the skills that you need to get those good-paying jobs that exist right here today. And the truth is, this is a growing company. When I was talking to Henry and the team, they me that since our historic tax cuts took effect, Miller Electric has already added more than 300 good-paying jobs right here in Jacksonville. (Applause.) But from when I walked in, you know, Henry and the team here made it clear they understand their success is because of all of you wearing those blue Miller shirts , all of you that are in this program. Like a project manager who has worked here since 1986. I'm told she was hired on as a helper. In the last three decades, she's worked hard and worked smart. She's risen through the ranks while making this company better and more profitable. I'm also told she recently earned an associate's degree with help from Miller Electric's tuition reimbursement program. And today, her expertise, determination, and thoughtfulness make her a model employee and someone everybody says is invaluable as a member of the Miller team. So would you all join me in showing your appreciation for one of your great colleagues here at Miller Electric: Donna Ward. Donna, where are you? (Applause.) Another example is a project manager who got his start here at Miller Electric back in 1990. And I'm actually old enough to remember 1990. (Laughter.) Some of you aren't. He actually, most importantly , before he was here , he served our country in the uniform of the United States Navy. He joined the apprenticeship program, eventually earning recognition as ""Apprentice of the Year."" Since then, he's received numerous awards for his exceptional work. And today, because of his experience and professionalism, he handles some of Miller Electric's largest and most valuable accounts. But I understand that despite his record of excellence, he actually will tell you that his greatest accomplishment is working alongside his wife, Lori Ann, and their two daughters, Lynsey and Taylor. So would you join me in giving a warm round of applause to Ken Mortensen for his service to America and his service to Miller Electric? Ken. (Applause.) You know, Donna and Ken, I know, are just emblematic of all of you in this room. So thanks for what all of you represent. You know, as I travel around this country and the President travels around this country, when we see growing companies, we know it's because there's a lot of hardworking people bringing their integrity and professionalism to work every day. So to the whole Miller team, give yourselves a round of applause. You all are setting the pace here in Jacksonville and all over the country. You're doing a great job. (Applause.) So as we're working to expand vocational education, I want to assure you this administration is fighting to give all Americans the tools to succeed, including Americans that made wrong choices earlier in their lives. Earlier today, I had a very moving experience. We toured the headquarters of an extraordinary program , it was started right here in Jacksonville , called Operation New Hope. It started 20 years ago and it was a way of organizing community leaders, law enforcement communities, and faith leaders to break the cycle of recidivism that exists today. People go into prison and the statistics tell us that within five years, 50 percent of people that have been incarcerated for a crime often end up back in prison. But Jacksonville said, 20 years ago, that you could do better. And you've been empowering former prisoners through job training and placement and through a full engagement by leaders and volunteers in the faith community. It's been truly inspiring. I also understand that Miller Electric has participated in this program and Operation New Hope. And I just want to say to Henry and the whole team, thank you for believing in second chances and giving these people in our community an opportunity to start again. (Applause.) And in that vein, last year, President Trump signed what we call the FIRST STEP Act. And we were just talking about it over at Operation New Hope. It helps to match prisoners with vocational education, with educational coursework, and with those important faith and character-based programs that give them the tools of mind and the tools of heart to make better choices in their life. And as I said before, it's remarkable to think that 50 percent of those who leave prison are re-incarcerated within the next five years. But listen to this: While the recidivism rate in Florida is 24 percent , that means people that have been in jail go back to jail 24 percent of the time , convicted felons who go through Operation New Hope here in Jacksonville, the recidivism rate is only 8 percent. Jacksonville is the city of second chances. And you all ought to be proud. (Applause.) It was an inspiring meeting and I expect you might read about it in the paper in the morning. But as I told everyone there, I want to assure you this administration will always be tough on crime. And this President and I want America to be the worst place in the world to commit a serious crime. But we also want to be the best place in the world once you've done your time to get a second chance for people that are willing to choose a better path, to choose an honest life. We're going to continue to work for opportunities. And I want to thank the Governor for the work he's done in this space already. And I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue. Thank you, Governor. (Applause.) It really is , what brought me to town today was to see that incredible program. But with the tremendous success that we've made in the Pledge for American Workers, and with the success here at Miller Electric, I had to come by and see all of you as well. And I just want to promise all of you that the President and I are going to continue to work hard to expand opportunities for pathways for people all across this country that want to get the education and training to be able to pursue new careers. You know, I believe each one of us have certain God-given abilities. It's , to the very bottom of my heart, I believe this: An education ought to be, and training ought to be, about discovering what those abilities are, discovering what your passion is, and having the ability to pursue that, just like everyone in this room has been able to do. And the truth of the matter is that every one of you at Miller Electric are emblematic of people that know that if you find your passion, you pursue your passion, and if you get the background and the training and the experience, the American Dream can happen. It's happening right here at Miller Electric. It's happening right here in Jacksonville. And we're going to keep fighting to make it happen for people all across America. That's my pledge to each and every one of you. (Applause.) So, I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits, but I just want to say thanks. Thanks again to the great Miller team , Henry and his whole family here. We're honored by your hospitality. Thank you all for the warm welcome. To Governor DeSantis, to Ivanka, thank you for what you all have done to expand opportunities for people all across Florida and all across this country. But for all the progress we've made, I want to leave you all with a challenge. I challenge all of you here to , if you like what you're seeing in a growing American economy; if you like policies that got Florida growing with strong state leadership; if you like the policies this President is advancing at the national level, I want you to , encourage you to keep standing with us and keep demanding the kind of policies and the kind of leaderships that will ensure that Americans have the opportunity to live their dreams. You know, it is kind of interesting: When the President and I first met about three years ago and he started talking to me about maybe joining this ticket, some people thought we were kind of different. (Laughter.) You know, I mean, I'm a small-town guy, he's a big-city New Yorker, right? He's bigger than life, always memorable; I'm not, right? (Laughter.) And , but the truth is, as he and I got to know one another I found out we had a lot in common. And it was a belief in the American Dream. I mean, if you want to understand what animates this President every single day, it's a boundless confidence in the American people and the ability of any American with the right opportunities and the right education making the right choices to live the American Dream. His passion comes from the same place mine does: His grandfather immigrated to this country; my grandfather immigrated to this country. His dad built a building businesses in New York, in Queens; my dad built a little gas station business in a small town. He went across the river and built the big buildings on Manhattan Island; I felt a calling into public service. I always tell people, you know, other than a whole lot of zeroes, we really got a lot in common. (Laughter.) And I mean a lot of zeroes. (Laughter.) And it's that belief in the American Dream, and that's really what we're fighting for every day. And I want to remind you all again, as you leave here today, just , if you like what you're seeing, if you like the policies this President is advancing, if you like the policies this governor is advancing, just stand with us. Tell the story of the difference that it's making in Florida and all across this country. And go tell your neighbors and friends about the opportunities that this economy is creating. I mean, here's a number for you: Did you know there's 7 million job openings in America today? And there's only about 6 million people looking for work. That's almost unprecedented in the history of this country. That's why we're investing in all new ways to get Americans off the sidelines and into the workforce with the skills and education they need. So I want to challenge every one of you, as you stand with us, as you're enthusiastic about these policies, you're enthusiastic about a renewed focus on skills education, vocational education, go tell the story of what you're doing here at Miller and what we're doing all across Florida and all across America. Tell your neighbors and friends who are unemployed or underemployed that there's great opportunities in this industry. There's an opportunity for them to develop their skills to be able to pursue their dreams at even a greater level. Tell them that Florida is growing every day, that America is growing every day. And more and more Americans are able to live out their dreams. And I'm absolutely convinced that if all of us continue to share the story of the success that this state and nation are experiencing, if we continue to tell our neighbors and friends about the opportunities to improve their lives and live out their dreams, we're not only going to meet the needs of this growing economy, but with your continued support; with Governor Ron DeSantis and his allies at the statehouse; with President Donald Trump in the White House; and with God's help, we're going to make Florida and America more prosperous than ever before. And to borrow a phrase, we're going to make America great again. (Applause.) Thanks, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.)

VSMP68201965	Mike Pence	2019-08-06	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Alliance Defending Freedom | Arlington, VA	speech	"Thank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you for that very warm welcome. It is an honor to be here today with the men and women of Alliance Defending Freedom. You are champions for our first freedom, and it is my great honor to be with all of you today. (Applause.) But before we get started, allow me to say a few words about the horrific mass shootings that occurred over this weekend in El Paso and Dayton. Like all Americans, Karen and I were outraged and sickened by these barbaric acts. As I stand before you today, 31 people have died, and 53 were injured. And it breaks our hearts to see so many innocent lives cut short by unspeakable violence. What happened this weekend were acts of pure evil, and we express our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives. And we join every American praying for the injured and their families in their hour of need. The Bible says, ""The Lord is close to the brokenhearted."" And that will be our prayer for the people of Dayton and El Paso. We also commend the men and women of law enforcement in both states, whose quick action and courageous service undoubtedly saved lives. They earned the admiration and gratitude of the American people. (Applause.) And as President Trump said in his address to the nation yesterday, ""Hate has no place in America"" and the sinister ideologies of ""racism, bigotry, and white supremacy must be defeated."" (Applause.) In the wake of previous violence, our administration worked on a bipartisan basis with the Congress to strengthen background checks and improve school safety. And in the wake of this weekend's mass shootings, the President has brought the full resources of the federal government to assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these heinous acts. Justice will be swift and certain. (Applause.) The President has also directed the FBI to use all legal means available to disrupt hate crimes and to prevent domestic terrorism before it occurs. We directed the Department of Justice to work with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop new tools to identify those seeking to do harm before they strike. And the President called for all of us to work together to end the glorification of violence in our society and to reform our mental health laws. We'll work to identify and treat and, where necessary, involuntarily confine all those deemed a risk to themselves or the public safety. (Applause.) And as we speak, our administration is working with members of Congress to ensure that all those who pose a risk to public safety are denied access to firearms. (Applause.) And finally, because justice delayed is justice denied, we're developing legislation to ensure that those who commit mass murders face the death penalty swiftly , (applause) , in years not decades. And tomorrow, the President and the First Lady will travel to Dayton and El Paso to express the sympathies and support of the American people for all those impacted by these hideous attacks. And as the President also said, ""Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love."" Now is the time to overcome evil with good. (Applause.) You know, it's always been true throughout the long history of this country that in times of trial the American people turn to faith and prayer. The Bible tells us that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, that He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal our land. And in this dark hour, for the people of El Paso and Dayton, we do well to pray , to pray for healing, to pray for the families of those that were lost and injured, and to pray for these communities and for our nation as a whole. We also do well, in this time, to recognize that the greatest source of community in the modern world is faith. Our nation was built on strong voluntary associations and depends on them more today than ever before. From the American founding, voluntary associations , churches, synagogues, places of worship and religious education , have been at the center of American communities and they are the wellspring of American strength. (Applause.) But as you all in ADF know well, we live in a time where we've seen people driving religion from the public square, and it's even become fashionable for many in the media and popular culture to mock religious belief. The freedom of religion was enshrined in the Bill of Rights as our first freedom because it was at the center of the American founding and also because it's the wellspring of order in a free society. Our first Vice President, John Adams, said, and I quote, ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."" And that's why, from early in this administration, President Trump has stood for the freedom of religion and stood with people of faith. (Applause.) As you know well, we've taken action to protect the freedom of speech in places of worship, and we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws. We've taken action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses and healthcare providers. We've also gone to court to protect the right to religious expression in the public square. And the Alliance Defending Freedom has been there every step of the way. (Applause.) And we thank you. We thank you for your leadership. We thank you for being champions of our first freedom and our values. I look forward to our discussion with my friend, Mike Ferris. But as I close, in the wake of the unspeakable violence that's on all of our hearts, in El Paso and Dayton, the American people can be assured that we will confront this evil in our time. We will work together to advance policies that make our families and our nation safer while protecting the constitutional rights of every American. And to defend our nation, we will defend our freedoms, as well. We will strengthen the foundations of faith and religion that have always been the wellspring of American character. So, men and women of the Alliance Defending Freedom, thank you. Thank you for your work. Thank you for the honor of being with you today. Keep standing strong for our first freedom and know that we'll stand with you, because in this challenging time in the life of our nation, we need our first freedom and our vibrant communities of faith more than ever before. Let's pray for the people of El Paso and Dayton. And as we pray, let's resolve to act to make our communities safer. And let's resolve that we will do our part to ensure that our heritage of family and faith and freedom is renewed and preserved for this generation and the next. God bless the people of El Paso and Dayton. God bless all of you here who defend the faith and freedom of the American people every day. And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP98201964	Mike Pence	2019-08-09	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Operation Coal Country Innovative Readiness Training | Manchester, KY	speech	"1:32 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Kentucky! (Applause.) Thank you for that very warm welcome. It is an honor to be with all of you today. To Governor Bevin, to Secretary Azar, to my friend Congressman Rogers, to Senator Stivers, to Captain Jon Polos and the whole team here, members of the Governor's Cabinet, to all the extraordinary men and women who are wearing the uniform of the United States of America and making us proud and making a difference across Eastern Kentucky: It is great to be with all of you. Thank you so much. (Applause.) And it's great to be here at the home of the Colonels, Eastern Kentucky University , (applause) , and to be part of Operation Coal Country. And also, as we just heard my friend say, here in the City of Hope, Manchester and Kentucky are setting the pace in the battle against opioid abuse and addiction, and I am honored to come here and celebrate that progress with all of you. (Applause.) You know, I really love this state, except during basketball season. (Laughter.) But we'll be back. (Laughter.) You know, it is great to be with all of you. But it really is especially great to be with a friend of mine. When I was governor of Indiana, I watched him take the responsibilities of governor here in Kentucky. He's a former captain in the United States Army. I knew then that he had an energy and a determination that could make a real difference here in the Commonwealth, and so it has. He's a man of faith. He's a strong defender of the sanctity of life. He's been an incredible partner with our President and this administration. And I'm told that Kentucky has already cut or amended 27 percent of state red tape. You're a Right to Work state. And now more than 50,000 jobs have been created. Would you join me in thank Governor Matt Bevin for all of that and his work on opioid abuse and addiction? (Applause.) Take a bow, Governor. It's also great to be here , I mentioned him a second ago, but he's someone who I served with during my 12 years in the United States Congress. I know he has served this region with incredible integrity and principle. He's a man who has personified the values and the ideals that make Eastern Kentucky special. And I'm told that, by about a year from now, he'll end up being the longest-serving member of the House or Senate in the history of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Would you just join me in thanking Congressman Hal Rogers for a lifetime of service to the people of Kentucky and America? (Applause.) Hal is my friend. And as you heard those compelling words that he just expressed, he's leaning into the effort and the challenge that you, across Eastern Kentucky, have particularly faced. And, Hal, I want to thank you for that. Thank you for supporting our efforts as well. And mentioning those two friends of mine, let me mention one more friend of mine who is a great fan of the state of Kentucky. He is a champion of the Armed Forces of the United States. And he's been leading an effort to combat opioid abuse and addiction all across this nation. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Thank you. You know, yesterday, our President and the First Lady traveled to Dayton and El Paso. They carried with them the support and compassion of the American people for the victims and the families of the mass shootings that took place this last weekend. Now, I know it's on everyone's hearts as well. And I also know that Kentucky is no stranger to the heartbreak of a mass shooting like we saw this weekend. And today, I can't help but think of the families who lost loved ones in Marshall County, now more than a year ago. In fact, on my way here, I remembered I still have a photo in my office of little Bailey Holt, a 15-year-old girl who lost her life that day. She actually lost her life because she was looking after others. Her mom told me, when we met, that Bailey could have made it out of the school. She was running out with other students. But she always wanted to work in healthcare , wanted to be a nurse. So, that day, she stopped to help one of the students that was injured, and then she lost her life. But Kentucky stepped forward. With this governor's leadership and the strong support in your state legislature, Kentucky passed bipartisan legislation to provide more school resource officers, mental health professionals in Kentucky schools, and created the new office of State [School] Security Marshal. And we are grateful, Governor, and to all the elected officials for the way you stepped forward and addressed this tragedy. (Applause.) But I know I speak for all of us , as we talk today about the progress we're making on healthcare and the progress we're making combatting opioid abuse and addiction , I know I speak for all of us when I say that the families of those communities in Ohio and Texas and the families in Western Kentucky impacted by these unspeakable , unspeakable , acts of violence will continue to be in our prayers. And I promise you, as the President said this Monday, we will confront this evil in our time with new and renewed energy. We will defend our families, our schools, our communities, and our nation, so help us God. (Applause.) So thank you for that. But it is good to be with all of you. And it's a special pleasure for me anytime I have the chance to be with men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and people who have put on the uniform representing every branch of the service who have come here to be a part of Operation Coal Country. And why don't you all stand up and take a bow? You all are making an incredible difference in the lives of people across this region. We're proud of each and every one of you. (Applause.) Great job. You know, I'm the proud father of a United States Marine, and the son of an army combat veteran. And I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. And I expect you all know you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back. I mean, I truly do believe President Donald Trump is the best friend the Armed Forces of the United States have ever had. (Applause.) I do. I mean, in the last two years, under the President's direction, we've taken decisive action, with the strong support of Congressman Rogers and both of your great senators, to rebuild our military. And we're restoring the arsenal of democracy. This President actually signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And that included the largest pay raise for members of the military in more than 10 years. (Applause.) So, thank you, Congressman. And while we're at it, let me say , let me say thank you to the Senate Majority Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, and Senator Rand Paul for their great support of our armed forces. (Applause.) You know, we always like to say that a truth of history is the Armed Forces of the United States are the greatest force for good in the history of the world. And today gives evidence of that among our people. This Innovative Readiness Training program is a program that is benefitting our military, making us more prepared when the men and women who are gathered here in uniform deploy, but it's also making a difference in the lives of the people of Eastern Kentucky and, frankly, people all across this country. I mean, each one of them are a part of that charge, in the words of our 16th President, ""to care for him that shall have borne the battle."" But coming here and doing the training here, impacting the quality of life of so many people across Eastern Kentucky , and, frankly, as this IRT program does all across America, providing critical medical, and vision, and dental care for Americans at the point of the need on the home front , is truly inspiring. And we've seen the impact of IRT all across Kentucky. Your governor actually fought hard to keep IRT in Kentucky. It may have been that military background. He just liked having a lot of these soldiers coming off , coming to the Commonwealth. But thanks to his leadership, last year, IRT's Operation Bobcat provided more 11,000 procedures to more than 2,600 patients in four counties just a little bit north of here. And now, as I stand here today , Operation Coal Country , more than 150 great military medical professionals from the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Army Reserve, Navy, Naval Reserve are providing the same care to four counties right here in Eastern Kentucky. And they're making a tremendous difference in the lives of our families. (Applause.) Captain Polos was just telling me about the services that have been provided here. And again, think about this innovative program. The military has to train to be ready. But the IRT program takes advantage of that fact and says, ""Well, why don't you come and train in communities at the point of the need, expanding healthcare services for people?"" It really is remarkable. I mean, the truth is, the IRT , the services provided here, as the Captain just told me , have already saved Kentuckians more than $600,000 in healthcare costs, and we're incredibly grateful to all of the men and women who provided this service. There's a few of them here worth mentioning. I guess there's an ear, nose, and throat doctor with the Franciscan Health in Northwest Indiana, a proud graduate of Valparaiso University in Porter County who's now the lead medical provider for this mission. Join me in thanking Major Matthew Provenzano. Where are you, Matthew? Take a bow. (Applause.) I'm just glad to know there's one more Hoosier in the house. (Laughter.) And there's another medical professional I wanted to mention, who has served on active duty for six years and in the Air Force Reserve for the last 19 years. He's deployed to the Middle East three times. He's received Meritorious Service Medals; the Air Force Achievement Medal; four Oak Leaf Clusters. He's an incredible, incredible airman. And now he's the assistant officer in charge of this entire operation. Join me in thanking Captain George Bates. Take a bow, Captain. Great job. (Applause.) Great job. And I expect Captain Bates would not want me to leave him out, but to join me in thanking Captain Jon Polos here for doing an incredible job leading this mission. Take a bow, Captain. (Applause.) Great job. These are all great Americans. You all have been making a difference. You've been making a difference among families that oftentimes don't have ready access to healthcare or maybe have difficulty affording it. So being out here, you're demonstrating not only the professionalism of your service, but the compassion of the American people. And doing that all across Kentucky and in rural areas across this country is making a tremendous positive impact on the health and wellbeing of our people. And the truth is, this IRT program plays a key role in our efforts to improve public health for communities most in need all over America. Today, the truth of the matter is we need healthcare across rural areas of America maybe now more than ever because we're in the midst of fighting the deadliest drug crisis in the history of this country. You know, it's heartbreaking to say that nearly 200 Americans every day lose their lives to drug overdoses. I can tell you that there is no community that has been spared, no state that has been spared. I expect, as I look out at this crowd today, there is no one in this room doesn't know a family or that's been impacted, particularly by opioid abuse and overdoses that have claimed lives. Back when I was governor of Indiana, I sat at the kitchen table with families who lost the most promising young people you could ever imagine. Never still could ever comprehend what happened to their young one. But then I've also sat at kitchen tables with moms and dads and young ones that found a way out, that found access to healthcare and, oftentimes, access to mental health that gave them the opportunity to find a pathway. And I want to reiterate what's been said at this podium before. Before we talk about the investments that are made and the progress that's been made, let me say a word to anyone out there that's caught up in drug abuse and addiction: There is help. Reach out. This community, this state, and this nation want you to make your way back. (Applause.) And the truth is, we've been getting tougher on drug dealers and the flow of narcotics across this country, tougher than ever before. But we know we can't arrest our way out of this problem. And that's why we've , we got medical professionals and all new resources that are flowing at the point of the need. And people that are caught up in drug abuse and addiction need to know there's help. There's help here in this county, here in this state, and here in this nation. And the truth of the matter is, I don't really have to tell people across the Commonwealth of Kentucky about what's happening with drug abuse and addiction. You all know from personal experience. I'm told, from 2008 to 2017, opioid-related overdose deaths in Kentucky tripled. Heroin-related deaths increased 22-fold. Meth-related overdose deaths increased 20-fold during that time. When we took office in 2017, Kentucky had the eighth- highest opioid overdose death rate in America and the sixth- highest meth death rate in this country as well. This was an epidemic across the state of Kentucky. It was then the President , speaking of the nation as a whole and communities across this country that were struggling , that we would do our best to work with leaders in Congress to provide the resources to, as he said, ""liberate our fellow Americans from the grip of drug addiction once and for all."" And over the past two and a half years, we've made progress. Thanks to the strong leadership of your governor and strong support of leaders in the legislature and in the national Congress, we've provided all new resources to Kentucky and states across this country. And I do want to take a moment to thank , to thank once again Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Rand Paul, as well as Congressman Hal Rogers. Thank you for supporting President Trump's vision to combat opioid abuse and addiction in an unprecedented manner. We're investing today more in combatting that single drug abuse than ever before in the history of this country, and we thank you. (Applause.) Let me also say, I know they're both recovering from health challenges themselves, and I want to send to my friend, Senator McConnell and Senator Paul, our best wishes for a speedy recovery. But we've made progress. Here in Kentucky, Governor Bevin actually increased funding at the state level by $79 million. And he mentioned, he made naloxone available all across this state, which can reverse an overdose once it has started. He limited the length of opioid prescriptions, expanded addiction treatment for those who are behind bars, and he's shown strong leadership at the state level. And as I mentioned, President Trump and our administration, with the support of our partners in Congress, have brought unprecedented resources to combat this crisis. Early on, the President signed into law more than a billion dollars to states like Kentucky to combat opioid abuse. And in just two and a half years, the Department of Justice has increased the number of federal opioid prosecutions by 40 percent. (Applause.) With the strong efforts of Secretary Alex Azar and our team at HHS, we've also been providing resources to states across the country. And it really is the other reason I came here today. Up to this time, we've actually awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to community health organizations, treatment centers, and other partners to support research, prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts all across Kentucky and all across America. Last year alone, this administration provided $131 million in drug control grants just in Kentucky, including more than $2.8 million to 23 community coalitions, one of which, I'm told, is right next door in Knox County. We've provided $50 million in grants to support the Governor's Kentucky Opioid Response Effort, targeting treatment services to parts of the Commonwealth that need it the most. And President Trump and your governor have been standing with the people of Kentucky, and the progress speaks for itself. Since our administration took office, we have 34 percent fewer opioids being described , prescribed all across America. Let me say that again: We have reduced opioid prescriptions across America by 34 percent. (Applause.) That's progress. Nearly 5 million pounds of unneeded or expired pills have been removed from our communities through the National Take Back program. And last year, and most important of all , last year, overdose deaths decreased by nearly 5 percent nationwide. It is a start toward recovery. (Applause.) And in this region of crisis, Manchester is a city of hope. Overdose deaths in Kentucky have been reduced by nearly 15 percent. (Applause.) Well done, Kentucky! That's amazing. That means more than 200 lives are being saved here in the Bluegrass State. Last year was the first time that overdose deaths have dropped in Kentucky in five years, and it's the first time they've gone down nationwide in nearly 30 years. And we're deeply grateful for the precious American lives that have been saved. But we know our work is not done. And I expect what brings many of you here today is your determination to finish the job. And I want you to know we're with you. As Secretary Azar mentioned just a few moments ago, our administration has already awarded more than $350 million in opioid grants to states grappling with addiction. That includes $87 million to the University of Kentucky. That was the largest research grant in UK history. (Applause.) And today, in addition to coming and commending all of those that are working in this important IRT program, as your Vice President, I'm pleased to announce to the people of Kentucky that the Department of Health and Human Services has authorized another $400 million in additional grants to fight the drug crisis nationwide. And nearly $10 million will come to the state of Kentucky. (Applause.) We are with you, Kentucky! We're going to provide grants of more than $160,000 for facilities in Whitesburg, Hazard, Prestonsburg, and Beattyville. Another grant is going to go to a prevention and treatment service right here at Eastern Kentucky University. Now, each of these grants is going to be used to hire professionals like counselors and social workers, nurses, and licensed mental health providers who will provide critical services that will be available all across this region. And one grant will go, I'm pleased to say, to a faith-based facility next door in Knox County. I'm thrilled the CEO is here with us today. Under his leadership, I'm told, his community health center is caring for more than 30,000 patients, providing medical and dental care at 39 schools in Eastern Kentucky, helping to deliver nearly 1,000 babies every year, and doing it all for the testimony of faith. Would you join me in showing our gratitude to Grace Community Health Center CEO, Mike Stanley? (Applause.) Where are you, Mike? Great job. Thank you, Mike. We're proud to partner with you. And thanks , thanks for your tremendous ministry and tremendous service of your whole team. We're also providing $750,000 for the University of Pikeville to help train the next generation of social workers and then place them where they can have the biggest impact. With today's new grant funding, we're going to continue to build on the progress that we've made to reduce demand for deadly drugs. The object here is to really come alongside people that have been caught up in drug abuse and addiction. And we'll continue to lean into it. I promise you that. We'll continue to provide Kentucky with the resources to support the personnel and the services that can help people find their way out of the darkness of drug abuse and addiction. But we recognize that while we work to reduce the demand for drugs, we also are determined to reduce the supply of drugs coming into this country. And the fact is that most of the drugs that are taking lives here in Kentucky and all across this country come across our southern border. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security seized enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child in America three times over. It's incredible. And in the midst of a crisis on our southern border, where we've seen month after month over 100,000 people , predominantly families with dependent children , coming in to cross over into our country and take advantage of loopholes in our law, make no mistake about it: It's also created an opportunity for drug cartels, in the midst of that crisis on our border, to move their illicit trade into the United States. It's one reason why the President declared a national emergency earlier this year. And we secured funding from the Congress and the Department of Defense to build a wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) It's also a reason why this President stood strong and demanded that Mexico do more to intervene in the crisis on our southern border. We called on Mexico, under the threat of potential tariffs, to step up to defend their southern border and do more to defend ours. And thanks to the President's strong stand , and I was in some of those negotiations , Mexico is doing more today to secure our southern border and theirs than ever before in modern history. (Applause.) And because of the work we've done and because of what Mexico is doing to partner with us, today the Department of Homeland Security will announce that apprehensions on our southern border have already dropped by nearly 40 percent in just two months. (Applause.) The President also negotiated a bipartisan agreement with Congress. With the strong support of Congressman Rogers and others in the Appropriations Committee, we were able to secure nearly $5 billion to deal with the humanitarian crisis that's facing our Customs and Border Protection. But I'll make you a promise, Kentucky: We're going to secure our border. We're going to end the crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border. We're also going to stop the flow of illegal drugs into America and into Kentucky. And we're going to fix this broken immigration system once and for all. That's our promise. (Applause.) So we gather today with reason to be hopeful. I hope the news today about the additional resources that our administration, our partners in Congress, your governor, and your state legislature have provided are an encouragement to you. More than that, I hope the way that Kentucky is putting it to good use is an encouragement to you. To see a 15 percent drop in 12 months in overdoses across this state is a testament to a lot of compassion and a lot of hard work and determination. But I want you to know we're going to continue to work very closely with the leaders of this state and with healthcare providers, with law enforcement, and with social workers to combat this crisis, to build on the momentum. There's reason to be hopeful , with the overdose deaths going down, drug prosecutions going up, our border becoming more secure. And I can say there's reason to be hopeful because of the determination I see on all the faces across this room. And I absolutely believe with all my heart that, in Kentucky and across America, we will confront the scourge of drug abuse and addiction. And we will save lives in our communities and across this nation. (Applause.) Our commitment is stronger than ever. And for those who receive treatment for addiction, we're going to continue to create more and more opportunities when they come back to their communities. And that's the good news. For people coming out of a scourge of drug abuse and addiction, there's opportunities all across this state in a growing economy, and that includes that 50,000 new jobs across the state of Kentucky. There's lots of good work to be had. And so I just leave here today with a grateful heart. I'm grateful to all these members of our military, who deserve one more round of applause for the difference that they're making. (Applause.) Thank you for your service. Thank you for being a part of a program that literally is changing lives, improving the health and wellbeing of the people of this state. I'm grateful to each and every one of you who've been a part of this incredible progress. As the congressman said so memorably , from what was a region in crisis, to turn Manchester into a city of hope , I want you to know Kentucky is leading the nation in finding our way back from this crisis of opioid abuse and addiction. And I thank you. I thank you for your inspiration. I really do. (Applause.) And I just want to tell you all that, as we go into the challenges in the days ahead, I want you to have faith, too. Faith that we're going to continue to improve the lives of families in Eastern Kentucky. We're going to continue to break the chains of addiction, expand healthcare and expand jobs and opportunity for all the people of this state. Have faith in the armed forces of this country whose professionalism and compassion is so evident in supporting families across this region. And finally, have faith in , have faith that, if we hold fast to the author of faith, the anchor of our souls, that we're going to see our way through every challenge that we face in these days, and that God will bless Kentucky and America beyond anything that we could ask or imagine, if we have faith. (Applause.) So, Kentucky, we're with you. We're proud of the work that you're doing here today. And I hope that today's announcement gives evidence that we're going to continue to stand with you for the families and the communities of this great commonwealth until we end the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction and improve the lives of people across this state. Thank you. God bless Kentucky and God bless America. (Applause.) END 2:03 P.M.

VSMP198201963	Mike Pence	2019-08-19	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Detroit Economic Club Luncheon	speech	"Well, thank you all. Thank you for that warm welcome. To Gerry Anderson, thank you for those kind words. And what a pleasure it is to be able to bring back home the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a son of Detroit, and a great, great champion for every American. (Applause.) Join me in thanking sen- , or Secretary Ben Carson again. (Applause.) It's also great to be here with his wife, Candy. It happens to be her birthday. (Applause.) What a great family. So, to Secretary Carson, to Congresswoman Debbie Dingle, to former Congressman Mike Bishop, to all of you: It is really an honor to be here in the Motor City to address such a distinguished group of Americans, the men and women and the leaders of the Detroit Economic Club. Thank you all so very much. (Applause.) And as Gerry said, it's a privilege for me to return to the Detroit Economic Club. Because I know that since 1934, this club has provided an extraordinary platform to leaders in private and public life, including every President of the United States for the last 50 years. Speaking of which, allow me to bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Michigan, who is a businessman-turned-President. Allow me to bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I told the President I was heading this way just this morning and he wanted me to extend his greetings and his admiration to each and every one of you. And he agreed with me that it's especially fitting for me to be here today before the Detroit Economic Club to talk about the state of the American economy because it was here that then-candidate Donald Trump unveiled our plan to reignite opportunity in America back on August the 8th, 2016. And I was sitting right on the front row when he did it. You know, it's amazing to think three years ago was a time when Americans were struggling through what was the slowest economic recovery since World War II. It was amazing. For eight solid years, the American economy , the most powerful economy in the history of the world , had grown by less than 2 percentage points. And in early August 2016, candidate Donald Trump came before all of you and he outlined an ambitious agenda that he said, in his words, would, quote, ""open a new chapter [of] American prosperity."" And that's exactly what we've done. (Applause.) It's true. He promised to enact an across-the-board income tax reduction. He promised to eliminate regulations, which he said in that speech ""are not necessary"" and ""do not improve public safety"" or ""needlessly kill jobs."" He promised to pursue ""great trade deals for our country,"" and to ""unleash an energy revolution."" And three years later, President Donald Trump delivered. And the American economy is booming. After eight long years of burdensome taxes and regulations, we went right to work. We cut taxes for job creators and families. In fact, businesses saw a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent. It was the largest percentage point reduction in the top marginal corporate rate in American history. (Applause.) It was amazing to think that the United States of America had one of the highest corporate rates in the world. But now we've lowered the corporate tax rate so that companies right here in Michigan can compete with companies and create jobs right here in this state and compete with companies all over the world. We also cut taxes for working families. And now the typical family of four in Michigan is saving about $2,000 a year. We rolled back red tape. In fact, President Trump has signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any President in American history, saving more than $33 billion in regulatory costs. (Applause.) And as you just heard from Secretary Carson, this President has also put communities that have been facing economic hardship first. And the truth is that, for too long, communities , particularly in our inner cities , were left behind. And with this President's leadership and with the strong support of Secretary Carson, we've already created more than 8,700 Opportunity Zones across America, including 70 right here in Detroit. (Applause.) And these Opportunity Zones can be transformational and are, in fact, expected to spur $100 billion in long-term private capital investment, creating jobs and opportunities in our cities all across the nation. And I got him a round of applause before, but I'll tell you what: If the President were standing here, he'd want me to get one more round of applause. We wouldn't be where we are today, with Opportunity Zones arising all across America, but for the great work of Secretary Ben Carson. So, Ben, thank you so much. (Applause.) Take a bow, will you? Great job. So, we've cut taxes, rolled back regulation. We've expanded opportunities for Americans. And as the President promised three years ago at this very podium, we also unleashed American energy. Early in this administration, the President withdrewAmerica from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. And today, the United States is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. (Applause.) In fact, next year, America will become a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) And, finally, though one administration after another allowed unfair trade deals to hollow out American manufacturing all across the Heartland of this country, this President pledged to put American jobs and American workers first, and that's exactly what we've done. He withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We appointed the toughest and smartest trade negotiators in the history of this country to fight on behalf of America's workers. We put China on notice that ""the era of economic surrender is over."" (Applause.) And American jobs and American workers are winning again. We've opened up European markets to more American farm products. We negotiated a new trade deal with South Korea. And this President also negotiated the largest trade deal in American history. The United States, Mexico-Canada Agreement is completed, and support in Congress is growing by the day. (Applause.) So, it's been about trade and jobs and tax cuts and regulation. Everything that the candidate talked about at this very podium three years ago, we've done. And the results have been nothing short of remarkable. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small have created more than 6.2 million jobs. And there are more Americans working today than ever before in the history of this country. (Applause.) The unemployment rate has dropped to a near 50-year low. We've seen the lowest unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans ever recorded. The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) And our economy is growing. The average household has seen their income go up by more than $5,000 a year. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. And maybe most important of all to the President and me: that wages are rising fastest for blue-collar working Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) Despite the irresponsible rhetoric of many in the mainstream media, the American economy is strong, and the U.S. economic outlook remains strong as well. Last week, despite some volatility in global markets, leading retailers also reported strong sales and earnings, and consumer spending posted its strongest reading since March. And under President Trump's leadership, as the son of the Heartland myself, I couldn't be more proud to say that the automotive industry is roaring back here in Michigan and all across the Heartland. (Applause.) It's true. This year, General Motors announced it will add 400 jobs. Ford announced they'll create 900 new jobs. Fiat-Chrysler is already building a $1.6 billion new assembly plant that will create 6,400 jobs right here in the Motor City. It's just incredible. You know, this economy is growing, and, frankly, you don't need to hear the statistics to know it. Karen and I slipped away for a couple of days a few months ago on a beach outside Fort Myers, Florida. And we were sitting there and we had our sunglasses and our ball caps on. But these two fellas walked by on the beach , true story , a couple of big guys wearing Budweiser t-shirts. One of them looked over at me and he said, ""Hey, you're Vice President Mike Pence."" I said, ""Yes, I am."" And he said, ""Well, listen "" He said, ""You got to tell the President that he's got to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I made the year before."" (Applause.) And I said, ""I'll tell him."" He took two steps away, and he turned around, and he said, ""And I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing as well, because it's working."" (Laughter.) And I told him we were going to keep doing what we're doing because it's working for working Americans. (Applause.) And I promise you today: We're going to keep it coming. We're going to keep it coming. Because for all we've done, the truth is we have , we have opportunities before us. You know, the late Lee Iacocca, who left us not long ago, said, famously, quote, ""We are continually faced by great opportunities disguised as insoluble problems."" And America faces some challenges today, but they're truly opportunities. As we see many economies around the world slowing, we know we can keep America's economy strong and growing. With sound monetary policy, we know we'll support more jobs in this country. With a merit-based immigration system, we'll meet the needs of a growing economy in ways that put America first. With the USMCA signed into law, we'll strengthen the economy of North America like never before. And by standing strong on our trade imbalance and structural issues with China, we'll protect American jobs and prosperity for generations to come. On the USMCA, I have to speak a word here in Michigan, because when the Congress reconvenes this September, we hope and trust that the Congress will take up , take up this important trade agreement, and take it up quickly. You deserve to know the USMCA levels the playing field for American workers and puts American jobs first. Under the USMCA, 75 percent of auto parts in duty-free cars must be made right here in North America, and 40 percent of them must be made by workers making what is essentially the hourly average wage here in the United States. We believe that will eliminate the historic incentive to manufacture outside the United States. It will eliminate the incentive to move jobs south of the border. The USMCA is a huge improvement on NAFTA. (Applause.) In fact, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add more than $68 billion to our economy and create another 176,000 American jobs. It's more than a good deal, as well. The USMCA actually may well serve as a template for all our future trade deals , whether with the EU, the UK, Japan, or even China. But we still need Congress to approve it. So while I'm here in Michigan today, let me ask you a favor. All of our friends in the Motor City and all across Michigan, and all the leaders here in the Detroit Economic Club: It's a good time to let your voice be heard. We need your help to get this done. Today is a day when you can let your voice be heard. Let's let Michigan's representatives in Washington know that Michigan and America need the USMCA. It's a win for manufacturing and a win for Michigan. Let's get it done. (Applause.) I mean, the President has done his job, Canada and Mexico are doing their job, and we need Congress to do its job and pass the USMCA this year. And by enacting the USMCA, we'll strengthen our economy. And make no mistake about it: By passing the USMCA, we'll strengthen the President's hand in negotiations with China. Seventeen years ago, America agreed to give Beijing open access to our economy: We brought China into the World Trade Organization. Previous administrations, of one party and another, made the choice in the hope that freedom in China would expand in all of its forms if we opened our markets to them, and I'm not talking about just economically, but also politically , with a newfound respect for classical liberal principles, the rule of law, private property, personal liberty, and religious freedom. We hoped to see an expansion of the entire family of human rights in China. But over the past 17 years, we haven't seen it. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party has used an arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade , policies like tariffs and quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft, and industrial subsidies , all the while, not becoming a freer society but actually, in so many ways, moving China in the opposite direction. Now, these policies that they've implemented have built Beijing's manufacturing base, but they've also resulted in a $500 billion annual trade deficit with America and hundreds of billions more in intellectual property theft every year. But as I stand before you today here at the Detroit Economic Club, know this: Under President Donald Trump's leadership, those days are over. (Applause.) At the President's direction, we've put tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods, and we announced additional tariffs that will take effect soon. And just last week, we labeled China as a currency manipulator. Now, let me be clear on this point: We don't want China's markets to suffer. In fact, we want them to thrive. President Trump has a positive relationship with President Xi, and we have great respect for the Chinese people. We're in the midst of productive discussions with China, and they'll continue in the weeks ahead. But for the United States to make a deal with China, Beijing needs to honor its commitments, beginning with the commitment China made in 1984 to respect the integrity of Hong Kong's laws through the Sino-British Joint Declaration. (Applause.) As the President said yesterday, it will be much harder for us to make a deal if something violent happens in Hong Kong. And I want to assure you, our administration will continue to urge Beijing to act in a humanitarian manner and urge China and the demonstrators in Hong Kong to resolve their differences peaceably. President Trump believes China wants to make a deal, but as the President has made clear, it's got to be a deal on our terms, because China has had it so good for so long. And things have to change. And as the President has said, the days of stealing American jobs, American companies, and America's ideas are over. And so they are. The time has come for China to come to the table, open their markets, and live by the rules of international commerce like every other industrialized nation does. (Applause.) So we're standing strong. And I want to assure you the United States will continue to engage in discussions with China, and we'll continue to pursue a reset in our relationship until our trading relationship with China is free, and fair, and reciprocal. So under the leadership of President Donald Trump, we've made extraordinary progress. But as I stand before you today, I'm also mindful of the fact that America has a choice to make in the next year and a half. A choice of whether we're going to stay on the path that's created unprecedented prosperity or whether we're going to take the hard left turn that you've heard leading Democrats offer on the debate stage right here in Detroit just two weeks ago. You know, watching the debate the other night, with all the Democrat candidates standing so far on the left, I thought that debate stage was going to flip over. (Laughter.) You know, as I said before, despite the wishful thinking of some naysayers in the media and in the Democratic Party, the American economy is strong. It's stronger than ever before. But make no mistake about it: For all of the progress we've made, all of it could be lost. If the policies advocated by Democrats on that debate stage take hold in the White House, it'll wreck the American economy. I mean, think about it: Where we cut taxes, they're talking about raising them. Where we rolled back red tape, they're talking about piling it on. Where we've unleashed American energy, they're talking about stifling it once again. In an economy built on free enterprise, it's remarkable to see leading Democrat candidates advocating an agenda like socialized medicine, abolishing private health insurance, or open borders, and even legalizing illegal immigration, or an extreme climate change agenda where some even called for eliminating fossil fuels. In fact, if you add up every budget-busting proposal they offer , from Medicare for All and the Green New Deal , it would actually cost every household in America over $900,000 over the next 10 years. And on trade, even though as one candidate observed, candidate [sic] is five , Canada is ""five minutes from here,"" and more than 60 percent of Michigan's exports go to either Canada or Mexico. Not one of the 20 candidates who stood on that stage is supporting the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement. And, in fact, several of their leading candidates actually oppose this new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. You know, I honestly believe, if any one of the Democrats on that debate stage wins the presidency, the gains of the last two and a half years would be wiped out. Taxes would skyrocket, the stock market would tank, jobs would vanish, and we would get that recession these naysayers keep talking about. So before I leave here today, I'm going to make you a promise: President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting to make sure that never happens. (Applause.) We're going to keep fighting for American jobs and American opportunities and American manufacturing, not just for this great industrial heartland, but for all the hardworking men and women of this country. And I want to promise all of you that it's those men and women that are never far from our minds. I mean, I'm talking about the people who make things and grow things; who spend their days building more than a Facebook page; who read the local paper, not the New York Times; who wear uniforms at home and abroad. (Applause.) I'm talking about people that put faith, and family, and freedom first. They love this country and they know what a blessing it is to be a citizen of the United States of America. And these are the people we're fighting for: every American regardless of race or creed or color who wants to work hard and live the American Dream. And I promise you we will never stop fighting until the American Dream is a reality for every American. (Applause.) So thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today and returning here to this storied club. Three years ago, President Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and made you a promise that we would ""open a new chapter in American prosperity."" And that's exactly what we've done. But now our challenge is to keep it open, to keep building on it, to face all the opportunities before us with confidence and determination and with principle. And this, I know, we'll do. In fact, I leave here today with confidence , confidence that we will continue to strengthen the greatest economy in the history of the world and the timeless principles that have always made America strong and prosperous. Confident that the American people will seize on all of those opportunities and keep on winning as never before. I'm confident that this country will reject the siren song of socialism and reaffirm our commitment to free enterprise and trade policies that put America first. We'll keep America thriving. We'll keep our economy growing. And with your help and support, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help, we will forge a brighter and more prosperous future for Michigan, the Midwest, and America than you could possibly imagine. In a word, we'll keep America great. (Applause.) Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless Michigan and God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP218201962	Mike Pence	2019-08-21	"Remarks by Vice President Pence at ""USMCA: A Better Deal for American Workers"" Event | Artesia, NM"	speech	"Well, hello, New Mexico! (Applause.) And I want to say thank you to Claire Chase. Thank you for those kind words. Claire is the Chairman of New Mexico Oil and Gas. She is an advocate for a growing New Mexico economy. Would you join me in thanking Claire Chase for her leadership , past, present, and future? (Applause.) Thank you, Claire. And to Secretary Ross, to Secretary Bernhardt, to Mayor Miller , (applause). Let's hear it for Mayor Raye Miller. This is a great town. To local leaders, to honored guests, and also to a young man whose mom just told me at the airport at Roswell , got here at 7:30 just to get in line. Where is Sean McCracken at? Sean? Thanks for coming out today, Sean. (Applause.) To all of you who've made a point to come out today to support this effort, to support this cause, and especially to all the tremendous men and women of Elite Well Services, it is great to join you here at the engine of America's energy renaissance, the Permian Basin. (Applause.) It's true. And as I get started, let me bring greetings from a great champion of American energy, someone who loves New Mexico and is inspired every day by what people working in this industry are doing to advance American energy independence. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, from our very first day in office, this President promised the American people that we were going to start, as he said, an ""energy revolution"" , one that celebrates American production on American soil. And President Donald Trump delivered. He's been delivering on that promise every single day. And American energy is booming here in the Permian Basin and all across America. (Applause.) From early on in this administration, the President has taken decisive action to unleash American energy. We approved the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. We issued permits for the New Burgos Pipeline that will cross the U.S.-Mexico border. We withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord. (Applause.) And we rolled back the Clean Power Plan and said ""yes"" to American energy. (Applause.) In fact, this President and this team you've already heard from today , this President has actually signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history. (Applause.) And while we've been cutting red tape, we've also been cutting taxes. (Applause.) President Donald Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. And now, a family of four, here in New Mexico, is saving about $2,000 a year that they can spend on their families, their education, or put in the bank for the future. (Applause.) All of those policies have created incredible results. As you just heard Secretary Ross say, today, the United States is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And next year, America will become a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) And you're making that happen. And, you know, it's not just energy that's booming. Since Election Day, businesses large and small all across this state and this nation have created 6.2 million new jobs, including nearly 35,000 jobs right here in New Mexico. The unemployment rate has hit a nearly 50-year low. And more Americans are working today than ever before in the long and storied history of this country. (Applause.) But it's not just about more jobs; it's about better wages. And the truth is, you look at the statistics now , wages are rising at their fastest pace in nearly a decade. And maybe most meaningful to the President and me, wages are rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) I mean, this economy has come roaring back. And, frankly, it's , it's companies like Elite Well Services that are making it happen all across the Permian Basin. And although it only began its operation seven years ago, this company has been leading the charge to unlock the full potential of the Permian Basin ever since. In fact, I'm told, Chase Energy literally doubled the number of its employees in the last three years. And you've grown the number of customers you serve by nearly 250 percent. That's worth a round of applause to the great team here at Elite Well Services. Great job. (Applause.) And we know that while these policies we're advancing have made a difference, Elite Well Services is a great company because it has great people, like one of the company's employees I heard about on my way here , actually the second person ever hired at Elite. She's the heart and soul of the company, I'm told. Treats every one of her colleagues like they're the most valuable member of the team. Always willing to go the extra mile to make sure this company succeeds and everybody working for her does well. And when she isn't here at work, I'm told, she's usually reading or relaxing with her husband, Benny, or they're off camping with their three kids or their four , what she says are , ""perfect grandchildren."" Would you all join me in showing your appreciation for Diane Griffin, one of the great, great team members? Where are you, Diane? (Applause.) Turn around. Take a bow. Great job. Thanks, Diane. Appreciate you. Congratulations on all the success here since that day you became the second employee of this place. Now, Diane , I mention her because she's really just emblematic of all of you. The men and women of this company and all of you who are working all across this region are really renewing American energy. You're living the American Dream. And everything we've accomplished in the last two and a half years is a testament to each and every one of you, to the leadership that you've supported in our national's capital. So, first and foremost, let me say, ""Thank you, New Mexico."" Thank you for believing in the American Dream. (Applause.) I'm grateful for your support, but I'm also here because we need your help. To keep the American economy growing, to keep American energy rolling, President Trump and I know that we've also got to level the playing field for American energy and American workers by forging trade deals that put America first. And that's exactly what we've been doing from the first days of this administration. We renegotiated a deal with South Korea. We're in serious negotiations with Japan and with the European Union. As soon as the UK finishes their work in Brexit, we're going to get a free trade agreement with the UK. And we put China on notice , (applause) , that the United States will no longer tolerate trade abuses or compromising the international rules of commerce, as they've done so for so many years. But the President, in the midst of all of that, also negotiated the largest trade deal in American history. And I'm here to tell you, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is a win for New Mexico and a win for America! (Applause.) And the time has come for Congress to pass the USMCA. And border states, like New Mexico, that rely on trade with your neighbors have the most to gain. The truth is, the USMCA is going to be a huge win for the American people, for New Mexico, but it's also a win for American energy. It's going to allow American companies to continue building the infrastructure that you need to carry American energy into Mexico. It will preserve the Investor-State Dispute Settlement that protects American energy's companies' rights. The USMCA will also keep Mexico's energy resources open to development by American companies, and it will guarantee no tariffs on American oil. (Applause.) You know, Canada and Mexico are already the top two destinations for American oil. They receive nearly 30 percent of all of our exports. And that number is only going to increase when the USMCA is signed into law. In fact, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add nearly $70 billion in investments all across our economy, and create nearly 180,000 American jobs. You know, in total, American exports to Canada are going to increase by $19 billion. And we project that they'll increase , exports will increase to Mexico by about $14 billion. Now, nearly half of New Mexico's exports go to either Canada or Mexico, and support 15,000 jobs. So the USMCA is not just a win for America, it is a big win for New Mexico and we've got to get Congress to pass it into law. (Applause.) That's why I'm here. Because we pass this thing into law, the numbers I just recited are only going to grow. And opportunities for companies like the company that is hosting us today and all of the great companies and families that are represented here are going to be able to expand and grow in the midst of this energy renaissance. But we've got to get it done. It's why I asked you to come out here, because the clock is ticking. And I figured the best place to turn up the heat on the USMCA was in the heart of New Mexico. (Applause.) I mean, the truth is , (laughs) , you all know something about heat. (Laughter.) You know, the truth is, the President has done his job. We've done our job. Mexico and Canada have done their job. Now it's time for Congress to do their job and pass the USMCA and pass it this year. (Applause.) You know, it really is amazing to be back in the Permian Basin. I was in West Texas not long ago and got to see firsthand the incredible , incredible drive toward American energy independence that's happening here. It's truly inspiring. And as I leave here today , and let you all find a little shadier or cooler place to be , I want to tell you, in my heart of hearts, I believe there's only two things that stand in the way of a boundless energy future, a future of American energy independence. The first is, we need to pass the USMCA. And that's going to open the door to a boundless future of American energy. (Applause.) That's number one. And second, we need to stand up and speak out with one voice. As we see this energy renaissance happening all across America, we have to reject the radical climate change agenda that is wanting to turn America's energy clock backwards. (Applause.) Am I right? We've got to say ""yes"" to America's energy independence and ""no"" to the Green New Deal. (Applause.) We've got to say ""yes"" to President Trump's vision for America's energy future, and ""no"" to any candidate for President who wants to eliminate fossil fuels or stand in the way of America's independent energy future. (Applause.) We need to stand strong. Men and women of New Mexico, we got to stand strong for the future of American energy. And I know you will. And I want to ask you , I want to ask you, as we work to get this largest trade deal in American history passed by the Congress, to let your voice be heard. I want each of you here today to reach out , reach out to those that represent you in Washington, D.C., here in New Mexico, and tell them that we need the USMCA to keep New Mexico's economy growing and to keep energy prospering and expanding here in the Permian Basin. I want you to call Congresswoman Torres Small. I want you to call Senator Udall. I want you to call Senator Heinrich. Tell them we need the USMCA, and we need it this year for New Mexico and America. (Applause.) And while you've got them on the phone, tell them that New Mexico believes in American energy independence. (Applause.) So, thanks for coming out today. I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits. In the days and weeks that lie ahead, I'll make you a promise: President Trump and I are going to keep fighting. We're going to keep fighting for all the policies that , that you've supported in Washington, D.C., that have made this , this booming economy a reality and that have made this energy renaissance a reality for every American. You know, I've long believed that the source of American greatness has always been our faith, our freedom, and our vast natural resources. In the last two and a half years, under President Trump's leadership, we've been standing strong on those ideals. We've been defending all the freedoms that make this country strong. And we've been defending the right of Americans to develop our God-given natural resources. (Applause.) And doing that , I see it all over the country , we're , we're making America great again. And I truly do believe that with your continued support, with the USMCA passed into law, with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with strong partners joining us on Capitol Hill, and with God's help, that we'll make America more prosperous than ever before. We'll make energy independence a reality for Americans like never before. And to borrow a phrase, we'll keep America great. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. God bless New Mexico. And God bless America.

VSMP288201961	Mike Pence	2019-08-28	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 101st American Legion National Convention | Indianapolis, IN	speech	"Well, National Commander Brett Reistad, National Adjutant Dan Wheeler, distinguished guests, but most of all, all of you members of the American Legion who have worn the uniform of the United States of America: It is great to be here with you in the city of Indianapolis at the 101st National Convention of the American Legion , (applause) , starting a new century of leadership. And let me say what an honor it is to be able to welcome so many of you here to the Hoosier State and to be back home again in Indiana. (Applause.) And I'm proud to say we've got some Hoosiers in the house. (Applause.) And I'm awfully proud to stand with all of you. The American Legion is the largest and most influential veterans organization in America and it's headquartered right here in Indiana. (Applause.) It really is great to be with so many friends from all across the country , veterans all who've served this country over the course of your life and are continuing to serve in your efforts to the American Legion. But let me mention one friend in particular. I'm especially honored to be joined today by a Vietnam combat veteran, a two-time recipient of the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star. And when I was governor, he was one of the greatest champions of veterans this state has ever known. And now he's one of Indiana's newest members of the Congress of the United States. Would you join me in welcoming Congressman Jim Baird to this American Legion National Convention? (Applause.) What a great American. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine, who when I told him that I was headed here to see all of you people today, I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) He is a champion of the men and women of our armed forces and their families. He is a champion of the veterans of the United States of America. And I bring greetings from our nation's Commander-in-Chief and the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it really is the greatest honor of my life to serve as Vice President to a President who gets up every day and fights to keep the promises that he made to the American people and to all of those who serve in uniform today and have served in the uniform of the United States. Because, frankly, this administration, just like the American Legion, has been standing for all of the same things. Like the Legion, we've stood with our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard. And we're giving them the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission again. (Applause.) We've stood by our veterans, giving them the benefits and care that they deserve once again. And under this President, this administration will always stand by our American flag, we will always stand for our national anthem, and just like the American Legion, we will always defend the freedom and sacrifice they represent. (Applause.) I promise you. Those cherished ideals are really what the American Legion is all about. You know, it's amazing to think a hundred years ago, veterans of this nation gathered in the city of Minneapolis at the request of the United States Congress to build a community of veterans. And so you have. When they gathered in Minneapolis, history records they swore to associate themselves for God and country. And to this day, the American Legion stands strong on its four founding pillars: to care for our veterans, a strong national defense, the wellbeing of America's youth, and championing the cause of Americanism. You've come alongside those who have borne the battle and for the families , the families that supported them. And last year alone, the Legion helped more than 2,400 veterans find jobs, and the American Legion raised more than $1.4 million for VA hospitals, and donated almost 4 million hours of community volunteer service. The American Legion is making a difference for our veterans. (Applause.) As the National Commander just said, I can testify firsthand you've been busy teaching our young people about the principles that make our country great, whether it's through the Boys Scouts, American Legion Baseball, or that American Legion Oratorical Contest. You know, I just did an interview with the magazine, and I , I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to the American Legion, because it was in that American Legion Oratorical Contest that my love affair for the Constitution of the United States of America began. And you have my thanks. (Applause.) The truth is, looking out at all of you and all of the distinguished leaders gathered on this stage, I know you come from the rest of us, but make no mistake about it: Your President and I know you're the best of us. So, on behalf of a grateful Commander-in-Chief, on behalf of a grateful nation, let me simply begin today by saying, ""Thank you for your service."" (Applause.) We'll always be grateful. But the American Legion is not only filled with members who have dedicated your lives to serving this country, first in uniform, and now standing alongside our veterans, but this organization has also lent your voice to the cause of the American veteran throughout our land. And I'm here to tell you I've been serving alongside him now for a little more than two and a half years. American veterans have a champion in President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I see it every time we're talking about issues affecting the veterans. This President is very impatient when it comes to us meeting the promises that we've made to our veterans. And I'm going to talk a little bit about that and what, together, we've been able to accomplish under this President's leadership. You know, the President put it well not long ago. He said, our veterans have fought for our country, and now our administration is going to keep fighting for you. Since the first days of this administration, I can tell you, your President, this Vice President, and our administration have been doing just that , and not a moment too soon. The truth is, three short years ago, years of budgetary neglect combined with ever-growing foreign commitments was sapping the strength of our men and women in uniform today and challenging their morale. Scandal after scandal at the VA revealed a cold indifference to the fate of our veterans. But under President Donald Trump, those days are over. (Applause.) You remember, in his speech to the American Legion in September of 2016, as a candidate, our President promised to ""rebuild our depleted military,"" and as he said, ""ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care"" and most importantly, we were going to ""stop apologizing for America"" and we were going to ""start celebrating America."" And that's exactly what we've done. (Applause.) And three years later, this President has delivered. And with the strong support of our allies in the Congress, as I stand before you today, America is more prosperous, our military is stronger, and our veterans are finally getting the care and the respect that you deserve every single day. (Applause.) You know, as the father of a United States Marine, I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. I'm proud to report to you as well that, since the first day of this administration, our President has worked to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And President Trump has actually signed into law the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And this month, we signed a budget deal that secured $738 billion for our military and gave our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the biggest pay raise they've had in the last 10 years. (Applause.) With that renewed investment, our Army will have nearly 300 new M1 Abrams tanks. The Navy will deploy the most advanced class of aircraft carriers in history. The Air Force will have hundreds of brand new Joint Strike Fighters, the F-35. And tomorrow, the President will install four-star General John Raymond as the first commander of U.S. Space Command. And very soon, we will stand up the sixth branch of our armed forces. The United States Space Command will be here soon. (Applause.) As the President has said, ""Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world."" And it's true. And with this renewed American strength, we are once again embracing our role as leader of the free world. As the world witnessed again at the G7 Summit just this last weekend, we have a President who is standing up for America on the world stage, who is putting America first every single day. And under this President's leadership, we're once again standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies. Our NATO allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before. We've confronted the world's largest state sponsor of terror when we withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. (Applause.) And after being taken advantage of in trade by many countries for more than a quarter of a century, this President has stood strong for American jobs and American workers. We've put China on notice that we will no longer tolerate their unfair and abusive trade practices. And the United States military will ensure the freedom of navigation on the Seven Seas around the world. (Applause.) And, as we all know, we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists, on our terms, on their soil. You know, five years ago, the so-called ISIS caliphate actually controlled nearly 35,000 square miles in Syria and Iraq. They subjected 5 million people to unspeakable barbarism and oppression. But, today, thanks to the courage of our armed forces and the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, earlier this year, the last inch of territory controlled by the ISIS caliphate was captured. (Applause.) The territory of the ISIS caliphate has crumbled. It's an extraordinary accomplishment for our troops and a source of great American pride. Beyond that, from the outset of this administration, this President also stood strong against North Korean aggression, and now North Korea is at the negotiating table. As I stand before you today, there's no more nuclear tests, no more threats against America. Three historic meetings have taken place. And thanks to the leadership of this President, North Korea's leader also promised to return the remains of all fallen U.S. service members in the Korean War. (Applause.) And, I have to tell you, the national commander mentioned that I'm not only the father of a Marine but I'm the son of a Korean combat veteran. And I have to tell you , and I told the President this, and he never gave me any greater honor than when he allowed me to represent him when the remains of the first 55 soldiers returned to American soil in Hawaii in July of last year. Watching those 55 small, flag-draped caskets come off the plane was an extraordinary experience. We brought back , we brought back our heroes, and there's more to come. We received then word that the very first soldier that was identified was Army Master Sergeant Charles H. McDaniel, of Vernon, Indiana. And now, the Master Sergeant is resting at home, where he belongs. (Applause.) At this point, more than two dozen have been identified and restored to their families and their communities. And I want to assure you that as we continue negotiations with North Korea, as we continue to seek peace on the Korean Peninsula, the denuclearization of North Korea, this President and this administration will not rest until we bring all our boys home from the Korean War. (Applause.) So we've been rebuilding our military, restoring the arsenal of democracy, and renewing American leadership on the world stage. But as President Trump has said, ""As we take care of those serving today"" , just like the American Legion , our ""administration is equally committed to taking care of every warrior that returns home as a veteran."" In this White House, let me be clear: This President and this administration know veterans' benefits are not entitlements; they are the ongoing compensation that was earned in the uniform of the United States of America. (Applause.) And since day one, our administration has taken decisive action to ensure that America keeps the solemn promises that it made to each and every one of you and all of our nation's heroes. And that began with fixing the VA. Under this President's leadership, with our partners in Congress, we passed the VA Mission Act , the most sweeping VA reform law in half a century. And today, nearly 3 million veterans have been able to see the doctor of their choice and get the medicine they need. (Applause.) The President also signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to ensure that our veterans receive the highest levels of service in the VA system. And today, I'm pleased to report that, under this administration, we've fired more than 7,000 VA employees for negligent behavior. The era of abuse at the VA is over. We're not going to put up with it anymore. (Applause.) And since our administration took office, wait times have dropped by 33 percent. In fact, the AMA says that wait times are now shorter for the VA than they are for private doctors. (Applause.) And that's just how it should be for our veterans. This year alone, the VA has processed more than 1.2 million claims for compensation and increased the number of appeals decisions by 70 percent. We're off to a great start making sure that our veterans are getting the healthcare that you earned. But we're going to keep pressing on it. I mean, the results speak for themselves. Before President Trump took office, trust in the VA among veterans was only 59 percent. Today, trust in the VA among veterans is 88 percent and rising. But as the President said, we're not going to stop until it's 100 percent of veterans approving the VA. (Applause.) We also increased funding for mental health services by almost $9 billion. The VA is now providing mental health screenings to every patient that walks through the door. And as we meet the healthcare needs of our veterans, let me make you another promise: This administration will always make room for the spiritual needs of our heroes at the VA as well. (Applause.) You might've heard even today that there's a lawsuit to remove a Bible that was carried in World War II from a Missing Man Table at a VA hospital in New Hampshire. There's a lawsuit underway. It's really no surprise because, under the last administration, VA hospitals were removing Bibles and even banning Christmas carols in an effort to be politically correct. But let me be clear: Under this administration, VA hospitals will not be religion-free zones. (Applause.) We will always respect the freedom of religion of every veteran of every faith. And my message to the New Hampshire VA hospital is: The Bible stays. (Applause.) Beyond our VA hospitals, we've also been making sure that our veterans get the care they need outside of our institutional care. And we've actually found permanent homes for nearly 30,000 homeless veterans. There should be no homeless veterans in America. (Applause.) We put an end to this scourge in at least 76 communities and three whole states. We've expanded the GI Bill so that veterans can get up to $24,000 to attend the college of their choice at any point in their careers. And just two weeks ago, President Trump directed the Department of Education to eliminate every last penny of student debt owed by permanently disabled veterans. (Applause.) With the stroke of a pen, President Trump wiped out as much as $750 million owed by more than 25,000 heroes. (Applause.) And he couldn't have been more right. He couldn't have been more right when he said that our heroes ""should not have to pay to live their dreams after they have paid so much [for] the American Dream."" (Applause.) And, of course, the greatest benefit of any returning veteran , people coming home from service in uniform , is a robust, dynamic, and growing economy. And we've delivered on that as well. This President has taken decisive action to reignite the engine of opportunity so that when America's warfighters return to civilian life, they have an abundance of opportunities to earn a good living and pursue their dreams. From early in this administration, we went right to work. After the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, where in the last eight years our economy only grew by 2 percent, this President and our administration went to work with Congress and we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses. We rolled back red tape. We cut more red tape in the first two years than any President in American history. We unleashed American energy so that, next year, America will be a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) And we fought for trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) The result for our veterans coming back in the workforce and for every American since Election Day: Businesses large and small have created more than 6 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen to a near 50-year low. The unemployment rate among veterans has fallen by nearly 40 percent. And under our administration, veterans' unemployment has reached the lowest level in nearly 20 years. Our veterans are working again and finding jobs. (Applause.) In fact, veterans' unemployment is now lower than even the national average. It's incredible. And to those of you that have a friend, a family member, or a veteran looking for work, you might remind them there's actually more job openings in America today than there are people looking for work. Never a better time. Never a better time to come back and go to work in this country. And over the past three years, with the strong support of the American Legion, our administration has , we've replaced weakness with vigor, doubt with confidence, and neglect with compassion and the care of the American people. Together, we're forging a new future of American strength. And, together, we're making America strong, we're making America secure, and we're making America great again. (Applause.) But if we want to keep America great, we've got to keep fighting, keep standing strong, keep demanding government as good as our people. And I promise you, we will. We're going to keep fighting also for all of the ideals that the American Legion has held dear and held up since your founding more than a century ago. The ideals that are the essence of Americanism, expressed in our Declaration that recites that we're endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights; endowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The ideals that are enshrined in our glorious Constitution that all of you in this room put on the uniform to defend. And, I promise you, those rights , those rights and God-given liberties enshrined in our Bill of Rights , I promise you this President, this Vice President, and all of the 140 judges that we have seen appointed to our federal courts at every level, are going to uphold all those liberties, from the freedom of speech, to the freedom of religion, to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) And we're going to , just like the American Legion has done, like you did in the service to this nation, and this organization has done through its long and storied history , we're going to , we'll always stand for freedom. You know, it's remarkable to think that some in Washington today actually openly advocate an economic system that has impoverished millions and stolen the freedom of generations. That system is socialism. But as those of you who have fought to defend our freedom know well, it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the strongest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. (Applause.) It was freedom. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two World Wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all of the world. And so, in the weeks and months ahead, I say to all of my friends here at the American Legion, and all of those looking on around the country: In the days that lie ahead, we must say with one voice, as President Trump said in his State of the Union Address, America will ""never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) Thank you. And we'll do this for this generation of Americans and for our posterity. We'll do this to preserve the last best hope of Earth. But make no mistake about it: We will also do this to honor the service and the sacrifice of all those in this room and in the generation who've gone before to preserve freedom and defend it. President Ronald Reagan used to say, ""Freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction."" And so, as we look ahead, let me remind you: We can't just settle to win the next election; we've got to win the next generation. We have to carry the message of freedom to every American. (Applause.) Because we have to remember , as all of you know better than me , the price that was paid for freedom. You know, standing before you today is deeply humbling because my life didn't take me into the uniform of the United States. But as the son of a combat veteran and a father of a member of the service, and soon to be the proud father-in-law of a Navy pilot , (applause) , my daughter just got engaged , it's an honor to be before you today and to be among those in my family who answered the call that you answered. All of you did your part. And the truth is, through your work in the American Legion, you're still doing it. But now, more than ever, we need your commitment to support our men and women in uniform today, to stand by those who have borne the battle and their families. And now, more than ever, we need you stand with all of those who are willing to stand up for the ideals that have always been synonymous with the American Legion. Ideals at the very heart of the American way of life. Ideals you fought to defend and that many defended at the cost of their very lives. As men and women of the American Legion know, freedom isn't free. It's bought at a price and has been defended with the dearest price of all. Last Friday, my wife Karen and I were at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where service members that fall in combat come home. We were there for the return of two combat soldiers , warriors who fell in a firefight about a week ago in Afghanistan: Master Sergeant Jose Gonzalez and Master Sergeant Luis Deleon, Special Forces, 7th Army. They were the best of the best. Incredible men. Both of them had been on multiple deployments overseas. Never hesitated to go back. I actually met Jose at Walter Reed Hospital in February of 2017. He was recovering from combat injuries he'd received and was preparing to get back to the fight. But as were talking with his wife, Brenda, she told me that as he was recovering at Walter Reed, it was Luis that came to her house and he said to her that Jose was going to be fine, and that when he returned to the fight, she shouldn't worry because, he said, ""I'll never leave him."" Karen and I stood there. We looked into the eyes of these two extraordinary women with tears in their eyes and tears in ours. And as I watched the two flag-draped coffins come off that aircraft together, all I could think is, he kept his word. He never left him. They both went into the battlefield together, and from there, to eternity. And today, their earthly remains are home. And I promise you, this nation will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of Master Sergeant Jose Gonzalez and Master Sergeant Luis Deleon. (Applause.) I recite their names with reverence. And I know there are names in your mind that you're thinking of now. We remember them. We're inspired by them. And our resolve is steeled to continue to stand for all they fought to defend. Ours is the land of the free because it's always been the home of the brave. And you are the brave. You stood in the gap. You held a far-distant post for freedom, and you counted our lives more important than yours. And the American people will always be grateful. As the Psalmist wrote, you ""trained your hands for war,"" and we thank Him who gave you the grace ""to advance against a troop"" and come home safe to serve all of those who also serve. So thank you for your service. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for doing your part in uniform, and every day since, to stand by our military, to stand for our freedom, doing your part to preserve this last best hope of Earth for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. May God bless the American Legion, the entire Legion family. May God bless the men and women of our armed forces. And may God bless America. Thank you all very much.

VSMP19201960	Mike Pence	2019-09-01	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Commemoration of the 80th Anniversary of the Outbreak of World War II | War ...	speech	"President Duda, President Steinmeier, other presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state, distinguished guests, and most of all, the noble citizens of Poland: It is an honor to be here, on behalf of the President of the United States and all of the American people, to mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Two years ago, President Donald Trump came to this very city and spoke of the remarkable bond between the American people and the people of Poland, saying, in his words, ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people."" (Applause.) And today, as Vice President of the United States, it's my great honor to stand here today, on behalf of the American people, including nearly 10 million Polish-Americans, in a Poland that is safe, strong, and free. (Applause.) As the President said that day in Krasiński Square, ""The story of Poland is the story of a people who never lost hope, who have never been broken who have never, ever forgotten who they are."" Today, in the heart of Warsaw, standing humbly before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, we've gathered to bear witness to the courage of a great people, to the spirit of a great nation, and to the profound and lasting strength of a great civilization. While the hearts of every American are with our fellow citizens in the path of a massive storm, today we remember how the gathering storm of the 20th century broke into warfare and invasion, followed by unspeakable hardship and heroism shown of the Polish people. During the five decades of untold struggle and suffering that followed the outbreak of World War II, the Polish people never lost hope, you never gave in to despair, and you never let go of your thousand-year history. In the years that followed this day 80 years ago, your light shone in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. The character, faith, and determination of the Polish people made all the difference. It would, in time, turn shattering defeat into glorious victory. It is difficult for any of us who are not Poles to fathom the horrors that began here 80 years ago, on the 1st of September 1939. Within weeks, the armies of Nazi Germany from the West, and the communist Soviet Union from the East, divided up this country into occupation zones. The maniacal Nazi leader issued the command for ""the physical destruction of the enemy"" and ordered the ""mercilessly and without compassion"" death of Polish men, women, and children. Those dual invasions marked the beginning of a conflict unlike anything the world had ever known before, and one we resolve here today the world will never know again. (Applause.)In just over four years, one in five Polish citizens would be murdered at the hands of an evil ideology bent on racial conquest and authoritarian rule. The Nazis systematically murdered 90 percent of Poland's more than 3 million Jews. Tens of thousands of brave patriots of the Polish resistance would be killed in the fight against the occupation of their homeland. Over 21,000 Polish sons and daughters were massacred at the hands of the communists in April 1940, in the Katyn forest, and buried in mass graves. And right here in this city, more than 150,000 Polish men, women, and children gave their lives in just nine weeks of the Warsaw Uprising , an uprising which was followed by the deliberate and total destruction of this city by German forces, while Soviet forces stood by and allowed the slaughter. Those who rose up died fighting to liberate these bloodstained streets from fascism, dictatorship, and the looming menace of communism. But as President Trump said two years ago, ""There is a courage and a strength deep in the Polish character that no one could destroy."" (Applause.) And today we remember the long roll call of Polish heroes who fought for freedom in those dark days. Their names and the memory of their heroism will be enshrined in the hearts of their people and freedom-loving people forever. The long and terrible war started here in Poland. But before long, that death struggle with totalitarianism involved the fates and compelled the extraordinary sacrifice of freedom-loving nations across the world. So today, we also remember the 16 million Americans who left the peace and comfort of their home to fight to liberate Europe. They stood against evil. And over 400,000 young American men, including thousands of Polish Americans, gave their last full measure of devotion for their country and the peoples of nations they did not know. Today, I remember my countrymen and their sacrifices with honor and gratitude. Today we remember the millions of brave and sturdy British citizens who served and sacrificed to save Europe, defend their sovereignty, their liberty, and their beloved Kingdom. So too we recall the incredible patriots of the French resistance , the Dutch, the Danish, the Belgians, the Czechs, the Greeks, the Romanians, and so many other underground movements and freedom fighters who entered history as legends of courage, and they demonstrated a selflessness that will be remembered for the ages. But none fought with more valor, or determination, or righteous fury than the Poles. And in their decades-long struggle against tyranny, Poland proved itself a homeland of heroes. (Applause.) As we remember the war that began here on Polish soil eight decades ago, we do well to pause and reflect on the causes of so great a conflagration. The fight against the twisted ideologies of Nazism and Communism reflected the eternal struggle between right and wrong, good and evil. They were driven by an ancient and wicked urge to claim power by any means and impose their will to control the lives of ordinary men and women. All morality became socialist morality. Whatever served the power of the state became justified , even murder on an unprecedented scale. But when we think of the depravity of totalitarianism, of the death squads, the concentration camps, the secret police, the state propaganda, the destruction of churches, and the endless hostility to people of faith, one cannot help but think of the words of another who lived under Soviet totalitarianism, the Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Pondering the ruinous times in which he lived, Solzhenitsyn reflected, and I quote, ""If I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire twentieth century I would be unable to find anything more precise than this: Men have forgotten God."" Those who sought to remake the world by force did not have the last word, because there was something greater at work. Through the brutality of war and through ""four decades of communist rule,"" as President Trump said two years ago in this city, ""Poland and the other captive nations of Europe endured a campaign to demolish your freedom your laws, your history, your identity,"" and your faith."" ""Yet you never lost that spirit. Your oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken."" (Applause.) In June 1979, one of Poland's greatest sons returned home as Pope John Paul II. History records that in this very square he preached that the Polish people could not understand their history or their future apart from the greatest source of their strength and goodness. The Holy Father's visit caused a ""revolution of conscience"" throughout the land. Within 16 months, solidarity became the first officially recognized free trade union in the Communist bloc. And the momentum of those nine days would eventually lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. (Applause.) But on that day, in this place, Pope John Paul II said that, Man cannot understand ""who he is, nor what his true dignity is, nor what his vocation is, nor what his final end is without Christ."" (Applause.) And when the Holy Father spoke those words, the millions of Poles gathered here fearlessly spoke for their nation and their history. Lifting their voices, they sang: ""We want God. We want God."" And their voices echoed across this nation and around the world. A memorial cross to honor that historic moment stands before us today just opposite the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is a symbol of Polish faith but also of Polish hope and resolve. It is a permanent testimony to the belief of the Polish people that true solidarity among people and among nations is only possible when that solidarity is seen in the light of a providential Creator. Today, we are gathered as friends, as allies, from more than 40 countries, representatives of freedom-loving nations. Today, the fates of our people are linked by a shared love of freedom and self-determination. So let us, on this day, resolve that the words heard in this square that unraveled that long night of oppression, not just for the people of Poland, but all across Eastern Europe , let us resolve that those words and truths that have sustained human freedom from the very beginning will never be forgotten. America and Poland will continue to stand with all of our allies for our common defense. And America and Poland will also continue to call on all our allies to live up to the promises that we've made to one another. For the American people and the Polish people ""know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and independent nations is the best defense [of] our freedoms"" now and always. (Applause.) So thank you for the honor of representing our President and the American people on this historic occasion as we mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Today, we remember those that were lost in Poland, in their long twilight struggle, and all of those who sacrificed from my nation and nations represented here to win a victory for freedom. We remember those that were lost on this day, but we also do well to celebrate , to celebrate an enduring victory for freedom and the role that the people of Poland played by their strength and their example. As President Trump said here in Warsaw two years ago, America never gave up on the ""freedom and independence of the Polish people, and we will never will."" (Applause.) And, on this occasion, if any should doubt that the destiny of mankind is freedom, let them look to Poland, to the courageous Polish people, and see for themselves the indomitable spirit, strength, and resilience of freedom-loving people standing on a foundation of faith. Through their decades-long struggle, their courage and faith shone forth, you prove again, here in Poland and for all the world, that though it may take decades, that ""where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" (Applause.) Having paid tribute to the past, we now look to the future. And with the inspiration, courage, and resolve of the Polish people, from this day forward, I can assure you that Poland, America, and all freedom-loving nations in the world will meet that future together. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Poland. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

VSMP59201958	Mike Pence	2019-09-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Lord Mayor's International Trade Dinner | London, United Kingdom	speech	"VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: To Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss, to Lord Mayor Peter Estlin, Ambassador Johnson, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: It is a profound honor for my wife Karen and me to join you here in the great hall of Guildhall for this second annual International Trade Dinner. Thank you for the honor. (Applause.) And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine and a businessman who's become a great champion of the special relationship between the United States and Kingdom , and the United Kingdom. Allow me to bring greetings and the warmest regards from the President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And before I go any further, allow me to also recognize another great American patriot who I promise you, and I expect you've seen firsthand, is working every day to strengthen the ties that bind the United Kingdom and the United States. Join me in thanking United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Ambassador Woody Johnson. (Applause.) As many of you may know, this is my first visit to the United Kingdom as Vice President of the United States. And as I stand before you tonight, it's deeply humbling to think back on all the great events in the history of English-speaking peoples that occurred in this hallowed spot, some of which have been spoken of here tonight. But for nearly two millennia, the citizens of London have braved ""the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,"" have been citizens of no ordinary city, and have demonstrated again and again the strength that has caused them to grow ""in the esteem of freedom-loving people the world over."" You are admired for your resilience, your fortitude, and you are rightly known for your ""stiff upper lip."" (Laughter.) And you have my respect. (Applause.) But perhaps the greatest symbol of the British spirit lies in this very hall. It's the image of the phoenix emblazoned on the shield of Magog, one of the ancient guardians of the city, I'm told. That shield was erected in the years just after the London blitz, when, out of the ashes of a terrible war, the city was reborn and rose to new heights of prosperity and prestige. And so as I stand here tonight, I can't help but think of that phoenix and of all of the hidden potential that it still represents, because we honestly believe that the United Kingdom is on the verge of what your new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, called a new golden age , a new era in which our two nations will stand side-by-side, shoulder-to-shoulder, and we will show the world how free and fair trade can promote prosperity and peace across the globe. (Applause.) Earlier today, it was my great honor to meet with Prime Minister Johnson at 10 Downing Street. I offered the President's regards and I assured him that the United States of America supports the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. I told him President Trump also asked me to convey that the United States of America is ready, willing, and able to do a free trade agreement with the UK immediately upon the completion of Brexit. (Applause.) I mentioned to him the fact that President Trump often likes to cite that the United States is the biggest economy in the world. And under the President's leadership, it's only gotten bigger. I'm proud to report to you that the American economy is booming. From the earliest days of our administration, this President rolled up his sleeve and went to work to keep the promises we made to the American people. We cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back regulations at a historic pace. We unleashed American energy, and the results have been remarkable. Since Election Day 2016, I'm proud to report that American businesses large and small have created more than 6 million new jobs. Unemployment in our country has hit a nearly 50-year low, our stock market is soaring, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. We've also worked to open up markets around the world to American products: Argentina to American pork, Vietnam to American corn and wheat, and the European Union to American beef. And since we took office, the President has pursued an ambitious trade agenda built on the principles of free and fair and reciprocal trade. We made a new trade deal with South Korea. We reached an agreement in principle with Japan for a free trade agreement. We've put China on notice. We ended the era of economic surrender by using the power of the United States economy. And this morning, we announced that negotiations on a new trade deal with China will resume in October. We also have begun negotiations with the European Union on a possible new trade deal. And President Trump has already signed the largest trade deal in American history: the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement, which awaits congressional approval. But as I told Prime Minister Johnson today, we believe a free trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom could increase trade between our two countries three or four times. And we're already going to work on that free trade agreement. When you're ready, we'll be ready. In fact, the President told me today to tell Prime Minister Johnson that when Brexit is complete, we will begin negotiations on a free trade agreement right away. Our message is clear: The minute the UK is out, America is in. (Applause.) When I told him that, your Prime Minister said, ""Fantastic."" And he renewed his pledge to drive a free trade agreement forward, and we'll be ready. He actually described the proposal, in his words, as a ""wonderful, massive opportunity for UK folks."" And we believe it's a wonderful, massive opportunity for people on both sides of the Atlantic. With the cameras in the room and after he left, the Prime Minister made the point that some things are off the table, although I can see right now we're going to have some pretty tough discussions over chlorinated chicken. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, let me be clear: The United States stands without apology for a strong, prosperous, and free United Kingdom. We always have. It was George Bernard Shaw's mischievous claim that, and I quote, ""England and America are two countries divided by a common language."" And there's been some truth to that. But the reality is, our two peoples have shared a special relationship since the settlers of Jamestown stepped onto the shore of Virginia now more than 400 years ago. After the conflicts of the 18th and early 19th century, the 20th century dawned with the great fusion of English-speaking people. The bonds of a shared language, a shared history, a shared vision of the future proved far stronger than any differences we had in the past. And, ultimately, it was based on what draws our two countries together. What unites us in an almost brotherly affection is our two peoples' common and heartfelt love of freedom. As I joined the leaders of more than 40 nations in Warsaw on Saturday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, I couldn't help but reflect on the times, over the course of the last century, when the shadow of tyranny fell over Europe and our nations' finest locked arms to defend the God-given liberties that make our partnership the envy of the world. Together, we stormed the beaches of Normandy to free Europe from Nazi Germany. Together, we stared down the Soviet Union and liberated millions trapped behind the Iron Curtain. And together, for more than 70 years, Old Glory and the Union Jack have flown high and proud in the defense of freedom. And they fly together today. Ever since our two countries signed the Atlantic Charter in 1941, our nations' leaders have worked side-by-side to confront any and all threats to our way of life. In fact, they've worked so closely together that they've often become good friends. Before President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson, there were Reagan and Thatcher, Kennedy and MacMillan, and, of course, Roosevelt and Churchill. You know, there's an old story that I think captures very well how close our two nations have become over the years. It was during the darkest days of World War II , just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor , when Winston Churchill was staying at the White House. One morning, eager to hear Churchill's reaction to a new idea, President Roosevelt wheeled himself into the great man's room only , only as he would later record , only to find the PM, quote, ""stark naked and gleaming pink from his bath."" (Laughter.) Immediately, the President begged his pardon, but Churchill apparently shrugged him off. ""No, no,"" that lion-hearted man said, adding, ""the Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the President of the United States."" (Laughter and applause.) Beyond that memorable candor, the truth is there's a bond that's always existed between our nations' leaders. Perhaps our special relationship finds its greatest expression in the bustling commerce that you've already heard about so eloquently tonight , the commerce between our two peoples and the connections between businesses large and small, and families in both our nations. It's amazing to think that last year alone, the two-way trade between our countries totaled more than $260 billion, and two-way investment more than a trillion dollars, between the U.S. and the UK. We're not only a top supplier of goods to the United Kingdom; we are each other's largest supplier of services, as well as each other's largest source of foreign direct investment. More than a million Brits get up every morning and go to work at American-owned firms. And more than a million Americans get up and go to work in British-owned counterparts in the States. In fact, there are good-paying jobs tied to UK investment in all 50 states in the United States. And because of President Trump's leadership in our economy, we're hiring more people every day. In fact, even without a new trade deal, the United Kingdom's trade with the United States is growing faster than its trade with the European Union. Our two economies are so closely integrated, so deeply intertwined, that our destinies are inextricably linked, as well. And so, whatever disagreements that occasionally arise between us, whatever the differences in outlook and perspective, the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom will never be broken. (Applause.) We know that we rise together; we grow together. And so, you can imagine, it was with great interest that the American people witnessed the historic election that took place in the United Kingdom a little more than three years ago. In June of 2016, the British people showed their independent spirit when they voted to leave the European Union. And more than a few people observed the parallels between your election and our own that would follow later in the year. In fact, President Trump said, back then, that the British people, in his words, ""took their country back,"" just like we're going to take America back. And since that time, there have been some who have cast doubt on the British people's decision, saying it represented a turning inward, a cutting off from the rest of the world, a diminishment of the country's prestige. But not America. We continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of the United Kingdom and we will always will. The truth is, a people who created the greatest empire in history, who alone held off the Nazi menace for more than a year; a people who have contributed more to the progress and civilization of mankind than almost any other need no lectures from anyone on how to conduct themselves in this critical hour of your history. (Applause.) That's our view. Now, we know a trade deal with the United States isn't the sum of your ambitions, it's only the beginning. I believe if we're to ensure that the 21st century witnesses a renaissance of commerce between freedom-loving countries, it'll be the United States and the United Kingdom that lead the way. Only by opening our markets to each other will we be able to inspire other countries to open their markets to our people. Only by raising the standards of our bilateral trade can we hope to raise the standards of international commerce. And only by working together hand-in-hand, will we claim this new era of peace and prosperity that the hardworking people of our countries so richly deserve. But it will all be born of the unity between our people forged in the fires of the 20th century, steeped in deep tradition and history, and probably best encapsulated in a speech that was given before our United States Congress by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He spoke words that I actually first read when I was standing in line to go into a memorial service a few days after September 11th, 2001. We were waiting in line to take our place in a pew to pray together as a nation, to mourn together as a nation. And the United Kingdom was there with us, not just to mourn but to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us to confront and defeat those who did us harm. But the words spoke of our two nations' special relationship, and I close with them tonight. Winston Churchill said to our Congress, ""[H]e must indeed have a blind soul who cannot see that some great purpose and design is being worked out here below of which we have the honor to be faithful servants."" He went on to say, ""It is not given to us to peer into the mysteries of the future. Still, I avow my hope and faith [and] in the days to come the British and American peoples will, for their own safety and for the good of all, walk together in majesty, in justice and in peace."" Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today grateful that that special relationship exists and grateful to say that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom has never been stronger. And with the leadership of President Donald Trump and the leadership of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the support of our two great peoples of these two great nations, and with God's help, I believe with all my heart that the people of the United States and the people of the United Kingdom will walk proudly together and lead the world to prosperity and peace in the 21st century, in majesty and justice and peace. (Applause.) So God bless you. God bless the United Kingdom. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

VSMP59201959	Mike Pence	2019-09-05	Remarks by Vice President Pence and Prime Minister Johnson of the United Kingdom Before Bilateral Meeting | London ...	speech	"PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Good afternoon, everybody. Mike, Vice President, have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, it's fantastic to welcome you to Number 10, Mr. Vice President, Mike. Great to have you here. And I had an absolutely wonderful time at the G7, and with President Trump talking about all the things that we're going to try to do together , free trade, all that. And I hope very much to take that forward today in our discussions. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for such a warm welcome. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Absolutely. It's great to see you again. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: And a very busy time here in the United Kingdom. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Always busy. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I'm grateful for your hospitality. I spoke to President Trump this morning , your friend , and he asked me to send you his very best greetings and to assure you that the United States supports the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. But he also wanted me to convey that the United States is ready, willing, and able to immediately negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Fantastic. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: The President often says that the United States has the biggest economy in the world, and we truly believe that a free trade agreement between the United States and the UK could increase trade , PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: It could. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: , between our countries by three or four times. We're anxious to do that. We're anxious to stand with you and to do everything in our power to strengthen what has been a historic and special relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. And it is embodied in the very warm and personal relationship that you have forged with President Trump, with myself, and with our administration. And I am truly honored to be here. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Mike, it's fantastic to have you here. And we will drive that free trade agreement forward. Of course, the U.S. economy is a wonderful, massive opportunity for UK folks. But it is still the case that, you know, the United States of America , the people of the United States of America , don't eat any British lamb or beef or haggis from Scotland. I think there are still barriers to trade in shower trays, would you believe it, from the UK, so , and many other products where we think we could free up the U.S. market. And I know that you guys are pretty tough negotiators. So we're going to work very hard to make sure that that free trade deal is one that works for all sides. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, he told me this morning , he said, ""You tell my friend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, that we're ready to go to work on that free trade agreement just as soon as you're ready,"" and, again, to make it clear to you that the United States supports the UK's decision to leave the EU. And we're ready to build this economic relationship immediately. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Fantastic. And, of course, we won't be , and we will make sure that we do everything to increase free trade. But the National Health Service , is always worth saying, to (inaudible) of UK media , the National Health Service is not on the table as far as our negotiations go. And nor , we're not too keen on that chlorinated chicken, either. We have a gigantic chlorinated chicken of our own here on the opposition benches. Anyway. I'm being , (laughter) , I'm being asked , I'm being asked to stop. Thank you all very much for coming along today. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you all. PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Thank you."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1367772/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-and-prime-minister-johnson-of-the-united-kingdom-before-bilateral-meeting-london-united-kingdom&speechType=1	Trade		London, United Kingdom	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-prime-minister-johnson-united-kingdom-bilateral-meeting-london-united-kingdom/
VSMP119201957	Mike Pence	2019-09-11	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Flight 93 18th Anniversary Observance | Shanksville, PA	speech	"Secretary Bernhardt, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans, and most of all, the families of the heroes who perished here, it is September 11th again. And it is deeply humbling, as Vice President of the United States, to stand before you today, at the Flight 93 National Memorial, as we pause to honor the 40 heroic Americans who were lost in this place 18 years ago. Today, all across this country, Americans will pause to reflect, remember, and never forget the events of this day 18 years ago in New York City, at the Pentagon, and here, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a ""common field one day"" became a ""field of honor forever."" On this most solemn of days, our hearts are also with the families of the 2,753 men and women who lost their lives at the World Trade Center, and the 184 men and women who perished at the Pentagon. The President, just this morning, paid his respects to the fallen, outside the Pentagon. We gather, as President Trump said earlier today, in his words, ""as one American family united by patriotism, bound by destiny, and sustained by faith in Almighty God."" (Applause.) The Bible says, if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And President Trump asked me to be here today to pay a debt of honor to the memory and the families of the 40 passengers and crew members of Flight 93 , men and women who rose up, who fought back, and who met unspeakable evil with selfless heroism and American strength. (Applause.) America was attacked on September the 11th, but America took the fight back to our enemies on that very same day, not on some foreign battlefield, but right here in the skies above these fields, where the heroes of Flight 93 were forged. Eighteen years ago today was a beautiful Tuesday morning, when Flight United , United Flight 93 left Newark Airport bound for San Francisco, and carried onboard 40 men and women from all across America, from every walk of life. At only 20 years of age, Deora Frances Bodley was the youngest person on board. A student at Santa Clara University, she volunteered at her local animal shelter and aspired to be a child psychologist. On September 11th, she was flying home after visiting friends in New Jersey. Also on board was Edward Porter Felt, an accomplished man with degrees in Colgate and Cornell University, two patents in encryption technology, devoted husband, the father of two daughters , a New Jersey native , was making a last-minute business trip to San Francisco. Then there was flight attendant, Wanda Anita Green, who had worked for United Airlines for 29 years. A mother of two, a deacon at her church, she earned a real estate license and dreamed of opening her own real estate office after retiring from flying. And Richard Guadagno , as you just heard , a dedicated public servant, a project manager for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, where he'd worked for 17 years. On September 11th, he was going home after celebrating with his parents, sister, and family, his grandmother's 100th birthday. A lawyer, a public relations executive, an antique dealer, a World War II veteran , as you've heard so eloquently from this podium already this morning, they were ordinary Americans, but their heroism would inspire the nation. When they took off at 8:42 a.m., their flight must've seemed just like any other. They had no way of knowing that within four minutes, American Flight 11 would hit the North Tower; within 21 minutes, United Flight 175 would hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center; and within 46 short minutes, their own flight would be hijacked by terrorists determined to strike another attack, this time on our nation's capital. And they had no way of knowing , those 40 remarkable men and women , that within 81 minutes from takeoff, their lives would be over, they would enter eternity, but not before they had earned a place of honor in the annals of American history and in the hearts of every American. (Applause.) It was 9:35 in the morning, when the plane diverted toward Washington, D.C., and immediately, the men and women of Flight 93 sprang into action. They began calling their loved ones and soon learned of the attacks that were gripping our nation. When Tom Burnett's wife told him about the attack on the Pentagon, he replied, ""We have to do something."" And so they did. At 9:47 a.m., Jeremy Glick told his wife that the passengers were voting on whether to charge the cockpit. And he later told her that those on board voted to act. And so they did. Talking with her husband on the phone, flight attendant Sandy Bradshaw uttered words that captured perfectly her and the passengers' clarity of purpose. She said, ""Everyone is running to first class. I've got to go. Bye."" And in the midst of the chaos, a young husband and father, a man starting a business career, prayed the Lord's Prayer with an airphone operator and recited a verse from the 23rd Psalm, only then to speak words that would echo the resolve of a nation: ""Let's roll."" History records they ran forward. They charged toward the cockpit. At 10:03 a.m., Flight 93 plummeted to the Earth, right here. In the early days after the attacks, a Pennsylvania State Trooper hung an American flag on an old dragline sitting atop a hill overlooking this crash site. But now, 18 years later, there stands a memorial, and an even more fitting tribute to the courage and sacrifice of that day. Just not far from here stands a 93-foot-tall Tower of Voices, which today holds eight chimes, each with a different musical note, to symbolize the voices of all of those lost 18 years ago. When played together, the notes form a perfect harmony , just as, in their final moments, the men and women of Flight 93 worked in concert to defend our nation, defend our capital, and defend our way of life. (Applause.) Here, at this memorial, the names of those 40 men and women are etched in marble. But I want to assure their precious families, they're also carved into the hearts and the memory of the American people. (Applause.) The Bible tells us that, ""The Lord is close to the broken-hearted."" And that's our prayer for you this day and every day. And it's our prayer for all of the families all across our nation who meet this day each year to remember a personal loss. We're with you. To the families gathered here: You honor us by your presence, and America stands with you. (Applause.) The American people will never forget or ever fail to be inspired by the courage of the men and women of Flight 93. We honor them by remembering them, and we honor them by resolving here and now that we will do as they did, each of us, in all of our varied roles, to prevent such evil from ever reaching our shores again. When Flight 93 went down, the heroes aboard were the first of a new generation of Americans to rise up, as citizen soldiers, in what would come to be known as the Global War on Terror. After September 11th, the rising generation of the new millennium also answered the call, and recruiting stations across the country had lines around the block. Since this day, 18 years ago, 5.5 million Americans have stepped forward to defend our country by enlisting in the Armed Forces of the United States. And we honor each and every one of them this day. (Applause.) And we especially honor the memory of the nearly 7,000 other Americans who gave their lives on other fields of battle since this day 18 years ago. To their families looking on, we pledge we will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of our fallen heroes. (Applause.) Today we honor those who fell on this hallowed ground. And in honoring them, we also honor every fallen hero since that day. We honor them by remembering their sacrifice. And as President Trump has done from the first day of this administration, we also honor our fallen by ensuring that the men and women serving in our armed forces today have the resources, training, and equipment to accomplish their mission and defend this nation. And this we will always do. (Applause.) We did not start this war. We did not seek it. But in every year that's passed, our armed forces have taken the fight to the enemy on our terms, on their soil. We have met the evildoers with a resolve and force beyond anything they could have imagined. Our armed forces took the fight to the terrorists who attacked us in the mountains of Afghanistan. Their mastermind met justice at the hands of Navy Seals in Abbottabad. And our armed forces, just this year, captured the last inch of territory controlled by the barbaric ISIS caliphate. (Applause.) But the threat of terrorism remains. And I can assure you, under this Commander-in-Chief, our armed forces will never relent until the Earth is purged of the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) What the terrorists of 9/11 did not understand is that the American people's love of peace is exceeded only by our resolve to defend our freedom. The fiery ordeal through which the heroes of Flight 93 passed lit the way for heroes that were to come. And it will inspire generations of Americans for all time. It is truly a privilege to be with you today here in Shanksville, along with my wife Karen, to honor the memory of the heroes of Flight 93. (Applause.) I pay tribute as Vice President and as a grateful American. But as I said when we were here two years ago, for us and our family, it's personal. Seventeen years ago, I was serving in Congress, and my wife and I made a point to bring our three small children here, to this hallowed ground, on a drive back from Washington, D.C. to Indiana. It was less than a year from that terrible day, but we wanted to come here, pay our respects, and make sure that our children saw this place and knew what happened here. I remember that day like it was yesterday. We didn't find this impressive memorial; we found a plywood wall, painted with the names of the fallen, a timeline listed, and a wooden cross in the field. (Applause.) With the help of one park ranger, we learned of the sequence of that day. And I remember asking the ranger: If the U.S. Capitol was the target, at what time would the plane have reached the Capitol building? And what she told me I'll never forget. For the time she mentioned, I, along with hundreds of others, was standing near the East Front of the House of Representatives. As I stand before you today, I say from my heart: I will always believe that I and many others in our nation's capital were able to go home that day and hug our families because of the courage and selflessness of your families, the heroes of Flight 93. (Applause.) Two years ago, on this occasion, I toured the memorial museum, and there, I took note of one the possessions of a passenger that was recovered at the crash site. Among what was left of what Todd Beamer brought on board was a book entitled, ""A Life of Integrity,"" by Howard Hendricks. As I looked at the display through the glass, I was struck by the book's title and how perfectly it represented what the men and women of Flight 93 demonstrated on that day 18 years ago. Shortly thereafter, I purchased a copy of the same edition of that devotional book, and it has flown with me every day since on Air Force Two as a quiet tribute not just to the man, but to all the passengers and crew of Flight 93 for all you've done for us. (Applause.) For what your loved ones did for my little family and countless others in our nation's capital that day, thank you. When heroes fall, words fail, for ""no greater love has a man than this that he should lay down his life for his friends."" This then is what the heroes of Flight 93 did. And it's important that we tell their story. I'm grateful that all of you are here today to hear it one more time. It's important that we tell their stories, because as has already been observed, a whole generation of Americans has come of age with no personal memory of 9/11. So the rest of us, my fellow Americans, must tell the story. We must never forget and never fail to honor the memory of those who were lost here, in New York City, and in Washington, D.C. And this we will do. We will tell their story; we will honor their memory always. (Applause.) So to the families of the fallen, as President Trump said this morning at the Pentagon, I say now, the memory of your loved ones will never die. They will always be with us. We will always tell their story to future generations. And as long as this nation endures, Americans will ever be inspired by the faithful and courageous words and deeds of the heroes of Flight 93. So may God bless our beloved fallen. May God bless and comfort the families gathered here and all those who suffered loss on this day 18 years ago. And may God continue to bless the United States of America with such men and women as the passengers and crew of Flight 93. (Applause.)

VSMP139201956	Mike Pence	2019-09-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Concerned Women for America's 40th Anniversary Celebration	speech	"Well, hello CWA! (Applause.) What a great night. It really is great to be here with all of you for the Concerned Women for America 40th Anniversary Gala. Getting started on the next 40 years of great conservative women leaders in America. (Applause.) And speaking of , speaking of women leaders, I've got to tell you, that's a , she's a hard act to follow. (Laughter.) But I'm used to it. And I appreciate you all , appreciate you all know the risk I took telling her I wanted to run for public office on our first date. (Laughter.) The fact that she went out with me again is evidence of God's grace , (laughter) , and her patience. But I've got to tell you: She's an incredible person, a life-long educator, a Marine Corps mom, a champion of military families, even an art teacher at a Christian school. Would you join me in showing your appreciation one more time , (applause) , for my amazing wife, the Second Lady of the United States of America, Karen Pence? (Applause.) Thank you. And we are really delighted to be here , really delighted to be with all of you on such a momentous occasion. And let me also bring greetings from a friend of mine, who I know wishes he could be here as well. He's someone who, each and every one of you know, gets up every day, and has been fighting for the values that have been synonymous with CWA throughout its four decades. I bring greetings and congratulations from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I've just literally left him in the Oval Office and told him I was headed your way. And I think he , I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) But he wanted me to extend greetings to each and every one of you. And also let me congratulate a couple of other people, and say you've got an incredible program tonight. And the honoree this evening is a friend of mine. I have to tell you: She is a champion for working families in the state of Iowa, a former lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. She has emerged as one of the most important conservative voices in the United States of America. Would you join me in congratulating CWA's 2019 Statesman of the Year, Senator Joni Ernst. Congratulations, Joni. (Applause.) Great job. And also, I have to tell you, you couldn't have asked for a better keynote speaker. He's someone that I have admired greatly for many years. And I remember, years ago, when he coined that phrase that he was conservative but he wasn't mad about it. (Laughter.) And he emerged on the national stage after an incredible career as governor of the state of Arkansas, a two-time national candidate. And he's someone who has been a champion for the values that everyone in this room has stood for throughout the 40 years of this great organization. And, by the way, he is a terrific dad, if you didn't notice that, too. Would you join me in thanking (inaudible) Governor Mike Huckabee. (Applause.) Governor, thank you so much for who you are and the leadership that you have provided. (Applause.) I'm just glad I get to speak before dinner and leave, because he's a hard man to precede. (Laughter.) But, Governor, it's great to see you and great to share the podium with you today. And I'm here tonight, really, just to say thank you. Thank you to all of you who have been leading this conservative movement now for more than four decades. It's remarkable to think about what this organization and this movement have accomplished over the 41 years. Forty-one years ago, the conservative movement, in so many ways, was a voice in the wilderness. But it was back then that an author , a woman in pastoral ministry and a mother of four , was watching television at home one night when she saw an interview with some abortion activists who claimed to speak on behalf of all American women. And the history of this great organization and movement records that when she heard that, she stood right up there in her living room and said, ""She doesn't speak for me."" (Applause.) And that night she laid the foundation for the CWA over the next 40 , four decades. She continued to build it into the largest women's public policy organization dedicated to biblical principles in America. Would you all mind getting on your feet and showing your appreciation for an extraordinary American leader, Beverly LaHaye? (Applause.) What an incredible person. And I know this is Bev's last gala leading the CWA, but I know she is as confident as each and every one are as well that we're going to continue see this great organization grow, the momentum of our movement grow. Under the leadership of your President and CEO of the last nine years, let's hear it for one of America's most articulate defenders of conservative values, Penny Nance. We appreciate your leadership. (Applause.) It really is exciting to be with you today. I just have a few minutes to reflect on the progress that we've made, but I do want to say, it's also , as I mention all of these great women leaders in the country, it's really great to have 40 Young Women for America chapter presidents with us tonight. Why don't you all take a bow? (Applause.) Great job. There they are. Great. Proud of you all. Way to step forward. Future leaders. You know, the contributions made by CWA to the conservative movement over the last 40 years are really hard to quantify. But the truth of the matter is that I hope you can see that, now more than ever, Beverly, the seven values that CWA was founded on have a champion in the White House, in President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Think about it. I mean, when it comes to all of the values you founded this organization on , life and faith and family and liberty and sovereignty , the CWA, I would argue, has never had a greater champion, a greater fighter for our values in the Oval Office. And you see it in the results. I mean, when look at the last two and a half years, I think there's only one way you can describe it. It's been two and half years of action. (Applause.) It's been two and a half years of results. It's been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, CWA. (Applause.) I mean, think about it. Think about it. We've rebuilt our military; restored the arsenal of democracy; and with the strong conservative men and women that you've helped elect on Capitol Hill, we've renewed American strength. And we're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources, equipment, and support they need to accomplish their mission and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) And with that renewed American strength, we've been standing up to our enemies and standing with our allies. I mean, this President and our troops in the field have taken the fight to our enemies on our terms, on their soil. You know, yesterday I was Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where Flight 93 met its fate. The President was at the Pentagon. We all thought very carefully about the progress we've made. And it's amazing to think what our armed forces have accomplished over the last 18 years. They took the fight to our enemies in the mountains of Afghanistan. Their chief architect met his fate in Abbottabad. And this year, every last inch of territory controlled by the radical Islamic ISIS was captured in Syria. (Applause.) Our allies are also contributing more to our common defense than ever before. And last year, another principle , another one of those seven values at the foundation of CWA , was proven out in this administration when President Trump did what no American President before him had the courage to do when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. (Applause.) Under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.) But beyond our national defense, I'm proud to report we've also made historic investments in border security, dealing with the crisis on our southern border and confronting illegal immigration impacting our communities. (Applause.) I met just this week with the Foreign Minister of Mexico. I'm proud to report that Mexico is doing more now than ever before to end the crisis at our southern border. And in just a short three months, apprehensions at our southern border are already down by more than 60 percent. (Applause.) And we've already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) And, of course, under President Trump's leadership and the support of the conservatives you've supported in the Congress, this economy is booming. Right from the outset of this administration, President Trump kept his promise. We cut taxes for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back red tape at historic levels. We unleashed American energy and the results have been amazing: 6.3 million new jobs created, the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low, and it's the lowest unemployment rate in 65 years for American women. (Applause.) I mean, the truth of the matter is, this economy , this economy is booming for everybody, and it's working and creating jobs that women are filling at every level all across this nation. In fact, it's not only a 65-year low for women, but also it is the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. (Applause.) The American Dream is working again, for every American. (Applause.) But as CWA has known since its founding, and all of you patrons here know, the source of our prosperity is that foundation of the faith and the ideals of the American people , the things CWA has been all about from the beginning. And President Trump has been busy strengthening the constitutional foundation and the commitment to those ideals of the American founding from day one. This President promised to fight judicial activism and appoint conservative judges to our courts at every level. And with last night's confirmation of Steven Seeger, President Trump has already seen 150 federal judges confirmed to our courts. (Applause.) And I promise you , I promise you, they're all men and women of integrity who will uphold all of the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) And moving these judges through, we've had the strong support of CWA. And let me just take this moment, on behalf of the President and myself and our entire administration, to say how profoundly grateful we are to Concerned Women for America that, just last fall, including many of you here tonight, took to Capitol Hill, took the phone lines, and took to the airwaves, and we confirmed Kavanaugh. (Applause.) Justice Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court of the United States. (Applause.) Great job. I'm also proud to serve an administration that has stood so strongly for our first freedom , the freedom of religion. And I promise you, this is an administration that will always defend the freedom of religion of every American of every faith. You know, back in 2016, the President promised, as he said, to, quote, ""defend your right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, [as] business owners and [as] academic institutions."" And that's exactly what we've done. We've taken action to protect the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. (Applause.) And after years of neglect, we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws. And we ended the last administration's assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor. (Applause.) And in this White House, we believe the freedom of speech should not end at the front door of our places of worship. And that's why this President took action to end enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and free up the pulpits of America. (Applause.) And as we've stood for liberty and the liberties of every American at a time when leading Democrats advocate late-term abortion and infanticide, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a , for a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) You know, Karen and I have long believed that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable: the aged, the infirmed, the disabled, and the unborn. In one of the President's very first acts in office , one of his very first acts , he reinstituted the Mexico City Policy to make sure that taxpayer dollars wouldn't be used to promote or provide abortion around the world. (Applause.) And we've expanded it since we started. And I'll never forget the day , this is true. Governor, you'll like this story. It was our very first maybe month in office and the March for Life was in Washington, D.C., on the National Mall, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain was visiting that day. And we were talking the day before, and the President was sitting behind the Resolute Desk. And he said , and they said, ""Well, you've been invited to address the March for Life, Mr. President, but we have a state visit by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom."" And he said, ""Oh, well, you know, I won't be able to be there. I won't be able to do that."" And then, standing there, I looked at him, and I said, ""Well, you know, they invited me, too."" (Laughter.) And the President looked up at me and he said, ""They invited you to the March?"" And I said, ""Well, yeah. I , you know, I've gone like a lot "" , (laughter) , "" over the years."" And he said, ""Well, you should definitely go."" (Laughter.) So I became the first Vice President in history to have the privilege to address the March for Life, and Karen and I have done it twice. (Applause.) Isn't that great? True story. Thank you. What a privilege. What a privilege it was for us to stand with all of those wonderful young people on that cold day. You know, and this administration didn't just stop at those actions and those words. You know, as Vice President, I get to cast tiebreaking votes in the United States Senate. And I don't know if I've had a higher honor than the day I cast the tiebreaking vote to allow states in America to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) And President Trump signed the bill. (Applause.) And if you hadn't heard about it, just last month, thanks to the President's leadership, it was announced that tens of millions of dollars of federal family planning funding are no longer going to flow to the largest abortion provider in America. (Applause.) And let me say, with so many in Washington standing for late-term abortion and even defending infanticide, I'll make you a promise. I see it in his eyes every time the topic comes up. This President, just like this movement, will always stand for the unalienable right to life. (Applause.) And thanks to your support and the leadership of this President and all of our allies in the Congress, life and liberty are winning in America again. But make no mistake about it , and that's what tonight ought to be about, and I expect the Governor is going to speak about it as well , we've got to be ready in the next year and a half. It'll all be evident on the television screens tonight from Houston. You know, I , (laughter) , it's eminently miss-able but , (laughter) , you can catch it on replay. And the truth is, the other side , the other side is motivated. They're motivated because of the progress that we've made in advancing sound conservative principles, putting them into practice, and seeing the real results for the American people. They want to undo all of the progress that we've made. Just look at their agenda. Where we cut taxes, they want to raise them. Where we rolled back regulation, they want to increase it. Where we've advanced the cause of life and liberty for every American, they want to take America back in the opposite direction. As we'll see on the debate stage tonight, the Democratic Party has gone so far to the left, I think that stage is probably going to about turn over. (Laughter.) Anybody else feel that way? I think it's going to flip. (Applause.) But the truth is, all kidding aside, the Democratic Party today has embraced a radical liberal agenda on social issues. And most remarkably, leading Democrat candidates for national office and in the Congress openly advocate an economic system that has impoverished millions and robbed the liberties of generations. It's amazing. I mean, Democrats today , leading voices in the Democratic Party , openly advocate socialism. But the members of CWA know it was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. (Applause.) It was freedom. It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. (Applause.) I say to you, the moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America. So, CWA, we must resolve, here and now, that in this next year and a half, we will say with one voice what the President said in his State of the Union Address: ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) Never do it. We got to do it. And I know we will. I mean, the truth is, the choice facing this country has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. We've made incredible progress in the last two and half years, but now it's time to redouble our efforts. I hope you're here to celebrate tonight. I hope you're here to take a moment to think about what's been accomplished since Beverly stood up in that living room 41 years ago. But then, like Beverly will no doubt admonish us before we leave tonight, it's all eyes forward. The challenges lie ahead. You know, Penny said it from this podium a few minutes ago and I am often reminded of it. President Reagan used to say, ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" So, men and women of CWA, it's not going to be enough for us just to win the next election. We've got to win the next generation with a message of life and liberty that CWA can carry all across this country. (Applause.) So, over the next 14 months, let's fight for the values that have made this country great and are making America great again. (Laughter.) Let's continue to speak out and let our voices be heard. And finally, let's have faith. It's been at the foundation of what CWA has been all about from its very beginning. I'd encourage you: Just have faith in this President, whose drive and vision have been delivering on the agenda that this organization was founded to advance. Have faith in the women of America, just as Beverly did when she said, ""She doesn't speak for me."" Have faith that if we carry our message out, that we'll find likeminded women across this country who care about the values that have made this country great , who care about faith and family and freedom, and will stand behind men and women standing for public office who will stand without apology with them. And finally, I just encourage you to exercise that other kind of faith , the faith that I know has carried this remarkable organization. It's the first thing Beverly said to me when she saw me tonight, and I know it's been the secret of this organization from its very beginning. I think it's a good time for us, as we look at the challenging days ahead and all the progress that we've made, to remember to pray for America, to pray for all those who serve in uniform, all those who serve in harm's way, and all of us who have the privilege of participating in public life or participating in the public debate. I really do believe that ancient promise that Americans have clung to throughout our history is just as true today as it's ever been. That if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like He's always done in the long and storied history of this miracle of a democracy. He'll hear from Heaven, and He'll heal this land , this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you, CWA. (Applause.) Congratulations on 40 years. (Applause.) God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP179201955	Mike Pence	2019-09-17	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement	speech	"Thank you all. Thank you for that warm welcome back to Heritage Foundation, which throughout the course of my public life, and back in my days in Indiana when I formed a small think tank to focus on state issues , Kay, I have to be honest with you, Heritage Foundation will always feel like home. And I thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. (Applause.) To the members of Congress who join us here today , great leaders on Capitol Hill; distinguished guests; ambassadors; and to all of you who, every day, are working in these hallways and oftentimes on the airwaves of America, building a nation and freedom, opportunity, and prosperity, and civil society flourish, it is an honor to be here today with each and every one of you. And while I'm grateful for that kind introduction, would you all just join me in thanking someone whose life and career are synonymous with the conservative movement? She's been a champion of the American Dream, and now she leads the Heritage Foundation with great distinction. Kay Coles James, thank you. (Applause.) Please, stand up and take a bow. It really is great to be back. You know, three years ago, I spoke to Heritage Foundation as Vice President-elect. And I remember at the time, Kay, that you warned me that the White House has a tendency to turn people prematurely gray. (Laughter.) But, honestly, I haven't changed a bit. (Laughter.) You know, the Heritage Foundation is a flagship of freedom. Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has been advancing conservative public policy based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, traditional values, and, from its very founding, focused on a strong national defense. And now for nearly half a century, it's undeniable the Heritage Foundation has made a difference for America. (Applause.) And allow me to bring greetings from a great fan of Heritage Foundation, and a great champion of all the ideals and values that are synonymous with this great institution. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as I told Heritage Foundation three years ago, when I gathered with each and every one of you, when President-elect was preparing to enter office, we believed then that our President had won a mandate for leadership and he'd make good use of it. Our transition office went right to work the morning after the election. The truth is, I'll never forget the night of Election Night, it was all called in, the President had gotten the phone call. We gave the speeches at the podium. It was about 4:30 in the morning. And as we were leaving the hotel, I'll never forget the President-elect looked at me and he said, ""I'll tell you what , it's been a long night. Let's not get started until 8:30 tomorrow morning."" (Laughter.) And when I got to the office, he was already at his desk. But we went right to work, taking the policies that the President-elect had campaigned on , the policies that the Heritage Foundation had advanced for decades , and worked to build a team to put them into practice. And let me acknowledge one of our helpful volunteers on our transition team who played a vital role in assembling a team that's been making America great again ever since. Would join me in thanking my friend, Dr. Ed Feulner, who's with us today and has played such a vital role , (applause) , yesterday, today, and tomorrow for freedom. Thank you, Ed. (Applause.) Great job. Now, we are gathered here today to talk about trade and economic growth. The Heritage Foundation has long understood that to provide for the common defense is the first object of the federal government. And I'm proud to report to all of you gathered here that, from the first days of this administration, under President Trump's leadership, we've been working to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. Just last month, President Trump completed a budget deal that secured $738 billion for our military. And that'll represent the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. And with the strong and unwavering support of these very same members of Congress and all those they represent, we are finally again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources they need to accomplish their mission and keep our nation safe. (Applause.) So, thank you all. And with that renewed American strength, our armed forces have taken the fight to our enemies on our terms, on their soil. We secured freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. We brought North Korea to the negotiating table. And our armed forces captured the last inch of territory controlled by the ISIS caliphate earlier this year. (Applause.) But the truth is, as President Trump has observed, ""Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world."" And in the wake of this weekend's unprovoked attack on several oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, I promise you: We're ready. As the President said, we ""don't want war with anybody,"" but the United States is prepared. We're locked and loaded. And we're ready to defend our interests and our allies in the region , make no mistake about it. As the President said yesterday, it's ""certainly looking like"" Iran was behind these attacks. And our intelligence community, at this very hour, is working diligently to review the evidence. And the Secretary of State is traveling to Saudi Arabia today to discuss our response. But if the attacks were initiated from Iran, the truth is they would just be the latest in a series of increasingly dangerous escalations instigated by the Islamic Republic. In the past few months alone, the Iranian regime has deployed their regional proxies to stage sabotage attacks against shipping in the Persian Gulf. They've supplied and trained their Houthi allies in Yemen to launch nearly 100 drone strikes against Saudi targets. And, in July, they openly exceeded the limits to their stockpile of low-enriched uranium that they agreed to in 2015. Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it's the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East. That's why President Trump withdrew from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and initiated a maximum pressure campaign against the regime in Tehran. And the truth is, our maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime is working. But know this: If Iran conducted this latest attack to pressure President Trump to back off, they will fail. America is ready to defend our interests. And because of the President's strong action to advance American energy independence, we're also less vulnerable today to threats to the global oil supply than ever before. This year, the United States will actually become a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. (Applause.) And the President has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as needed, to keep energy markets well supplied, and he's also directed appropriate agencies to expedite approval of oil pipelines. These attacks against our allies and the global energy supply will fail. But as I close on this point, let me say we're evaluating all the evidence. We're consulting with our allies. And the President will determine the best course of action in the days ahead. But I promise you, under President Donald Trump, America will maintain our energy dominance, we will maintain our momentum toward energy independence. And the United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our military and the national defense. But on this Constitution Day, I'm proud to report that we've also been standing strong for the Constitution itself, for the principles of limited government, for the values enshrined in our founding documents. You know, the Heritage Foundation has always been a bulwark of traditional values. And as I stand before you today, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the unalienable right to life. (Applause.) In one of the President's first acts in office, he reinstituted the Mexico City Policy to make sure that American tax dollars would not be used to promote or provide abortion around the world. And we've expanded it in recent days. And I don't know if I've had a higher honor, as President of the Senate, the day I cast the deciding vote to allow states across America to defund Planned Parenthood. (Applause.) But as we've stood for the unalienable right to life, the President also stood strong for the constitutional foundation of our courts. And I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to pay one more debt of gratitude and boundless admiration to a man who has been a champion of our Constitution, a champion of the values and ideals that have made this nation great throughout its long and storied career. Would you all join me in thanking Attorney General Ed Meese for all he has done for America? (Applause.) Thank you, General. General Meese will be glad to know , and he's been a great counselor on this point , that, as a candidate, our President promised to appoint strict constructionists to our federal courts at every level in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And that's just what he's done. And I'm proud to report, in the last two and a half years, President Trump has appointed 150 federal judges to our courts, and they're all conservatives who are committed to upholding the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, including the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) We're making historic progress, strengthening the constitutional foundation of our courts through the appointments this President has made and will continue to make. But Democrats and their allies in the media are obviously getting desperate. After dominating our courts for more than a generation, leading Democrats today are now openly calling for packing the Court. And this week, they've even taken to smearing a sitting justice on the Supreme Court of the United States with discredited allegations. The calls by Democrat candidates for president to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the Court are a disgrace and nothing short of an attack on our independent judiciary. Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a good and decent man, he is a principled jurist and a credit to the highest court in the land, and these attacks on Justice Kavanaugh must stop. (Applause.) So we've been standing strong for our national defense, for the rule of law, and for our values. But under this President, we've also been taking action to get this economy moving again, which brings us here today , one more opportunity to add even more momentum to an American economy that is booming. The truth is, from day one, we've been putting into practice the very principles that Heritage Foundation has stood for since its founding in 1973: lower taxes, less regulation, more American energy, and greater individual liberty. From the early days of this administration, President Trump has rolled back red tape at a historic level. In fact, this President has signed more laws cutting federal red tape already than any President in American history, saving more than $33 billion in regulatory costs. We've also unleashed American energy. This President withdrew America from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord. And today, the United States, as I mentioned, is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And, of course, it wasn't just rolling back regulations and unleashing American energy. This President kept his promise in the early days of this administration when he signed into law the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. (Applause.) In fact, businesses saw a corporate tax rate reduction from one of the highest in the industrialized world to 21 percent. It was the largest percentage point reduction in the top marginal corporate rate in the history of this country. We also cut taxes for working families. We doubled the child tax credit. We doubled the standard deduction. And now the typical family of four is saving about $2,000 a year. The result of all of that , less regulation, less taxes, more American energy , has truly been remarkable. As I stand here today at the Heritage Foundation, I'm proud to report, since Election Day, businesses large and small across this country have created more than 6 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low. (Applause.) In two and a half short years, more than 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. And wages are rising at their fastest pace in more than 10 years. In fact, the average worker has seen their wages go up by more than $1,000 in the last year alone. The economy is soaring. And you really , you don't need to hear it by studying statistics. These congressmen will attest we hear it on the street every single day. I had that happen myself when Karen and I slipped away down to the Fort Myers area for a couple of days on the beach earlier this year. We were sitting there in our ball caps and our sunglasses taking in a few enjoyable hours of rest there on the beach, and these two fellas came walking by wearing big Budweiser t-shirts. And one of them stopped and turned to me and he said, ""Hey, you're Vice President Mike Pence."" (Laughter.) And I said, ""Yes, I am."" (Laughter.) And he looked at me and he said, ""Well, listen, you got to tell the President that he's got to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I did the year before."" And I told him I'd tell the President word for word. And I did it. (Applause.) It's true. And then he took three steps away, and he turned back, and looked at me and he said, ""Now, I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing too."" (Laughter.) I told him I would. (Laughter.) I mean, the truth is, we're here today , we're here today because of the tremendous progress that we've made. But I'm also here today to talk about a great opportunity , an opportunity before us to build on the momentum that we've seen in this economy. I'm here today to call on the Congress of the United States to pass the largest trade deal in American history. It's time for Congress to pass the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement. (Applause.) You know, this President was no fan of NAFTA. He often reflected on the campaign trail what I saw back in the state of Indiana, about the impact , unintentional or otherwise , that NAFTA had on many communities, many factories across the country that had closed in the last quarter century. But he promised that we could do better. He promised that we'd sit down with Mexico and Canada and negotiate a new deal that would put , that put jobs and prosperity first. And he did just that. Now, I got to tell you, I was in on a lot of those discussions with President Obrador's predecessor and with Prime Minister Trudeau in Canada. I saw this President drive a hard bargain, but I also saw our neighbors to the north and the south negotiate in good faith. So let me take this opportunity to not only thank Mexico and Canada, but let me also give you a chance to join me in thanking their representatives who are with us today: The Ambassador of Canada to the United States of America, Kirsten Hillman, and Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena. Would you stand up and let us show you how much we appreciate your efforts? (Applause.) Thank you. The truth is, as you all know here at the Heritage Foundation, since the early post-war era, America's prosperity has rested on the ingenuity, the determination, the hard work of the American people. But it's also , also rested on robust trade with freedom-loving nations around the world. It was a landmark free trade agreement, after all, that helped revive the global economy after the Second World War. In 1947, the United States and 22 other nations came together to forge an agreement that leveled the playing field for American businesses. It actually laid a foundation for decades of economic growth. It's called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And early on, it worked. It worked to create prosperity in this country and really helped the world recover from the devastations of war. Tariffs in industrialized countries fell an average of 40 percent to around 5 percent today. But, frankly, today, as we've negotiated trade agreements among so many different countries with so many different interests, too many countries around the world, in the decades that have followed, have taken advantage of the United States in the process, often to the detriment of hardworking Americans. And President Trump, as a candidate and as your President, has called them out and demanded that we put American jobs and American workers first. The truth is, though, one administration after another stood by and watched unfair trade practices hollow out American manufacturing in particular. This President promised to fight for American jobs and American workers. Three years ago, the businessman-turned-candidate said that, ""No longer will we enter into these massive trade deals with many countries that are thousands of pages long, that no one from any country reads or understands."" And he's demanded that we move forward. We withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We signed up the toughest and smartest trade negotiators we've ever had to crack down on China's unfair trade practices and negotiate new trade deals with our partners around the world. We've ended the era of economic surrender. And we're using the power of the strongest economy in the history of the world to put our jobs and our workers first. And now, American jobs and American workers are winning again. You know, I remember when the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And, literally, the last President said that those jobs were gone for good, remember? He said, what are you going to , ""You got a magic wand to bring them back?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand; we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. We've seen 500,000 manufacturing jobs created since Election Day alone. (Applause.) The truth is, we've been working hard to open up markets around the world to goods and services: Argentina to American pork, Vietnam to American grain, the European Union to American beef. And time after time, as our friends from Canada and Mexico can attest, the President has been calling for free and fair and reciprocal trade, driving a hard bargain to open up markets to countries that have access to the American consumer. And since we took office, the President pursued an ambitious trade agenda that's been built on those principles of free and fair and reciprocal trade. We dramatically improved our trade agreement with South Korea. Three years ago, we reached an agreement in principle on a first stage. Just a few months ago, the first stage of a free trade agreement with Japan. Two weeks ago, I told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the United States is ready to immediately begin negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom as soon as Brexit is complete. And we're ready. (Applause.) Beyond all that, this President put China on notice that the decades of massive trade deficits, intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfer , the decades of China ignoring the rules of international commerce , are over. But I came here today to talk about why it's absolutely vital for Congress pass the USMCA. According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add nearly $70 billion in investments in this country and create nearly 180,000 American jobs just in the early going. In total, American exports to Canada, we believe that we'll see increases by $19 billion, and exports to Mexico will increase by $14 billion. And while NAFTA passed before even dial-up Internet, the brand new Digital Trade Chapter of the USMCA contains the strongest language on digital trade of any international agreement in history. And the USMCA will be a big win for American energy as well. Canada and Mexico are the top two destinations for American oil, already receiving nearly 30 percent of our exports. And that number will only increase under the USMCA. It will keep Mexico's energy resources open to development by American companies, and it will guarantee no tariffs on American oil. The USMCA also levels the playing field for American workers and American jobs. Under the USMCA, 75 percent of auto parts in duty-free cars must be made right here in North America, and a significant portion of these parts must be made by workers making a base wage of at least $16 per hour. We believe that this will eliminate the historic incentive to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States of America. President Donald Trump is putting American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) And I know we're all watching as the news between the UAW and General Motors , the strike that began yesterday. But I have a respectful message for all the United Auto Workers who are currently on strike. As the President said, we hope and trust you'll work out your differences with GM. But while you're at it, if you really want to support our nation's auto workers, the UAW and GM ought to tell Congress to pass the USMCA and make sure there's more autoworkers jobs for decades to come. (Applause.) So the record is clear: The USMCA is a win. It's a win for American energy. It's a win for American agriculture. It's a win for American manufacturing. As I stand before you today, I'm proud to report the President has done his job. Canada and Mexico are doing their job. Now we need Congress to do its job and pass the USMCA. And it's more than just a good deal between our three countries. Experts often reflect that the USMCA is so advanced, it's so comprehensive that, it may well serve as a template , a model trade agreement , for future trade agreements in the decades ahead, whether with the United Kingdom, Japan, the European Union, or even China. And by passing the USMCA, it will also strengthen the President's hand in the negotiations with that last country. By bringing North America together, by demonstrating our ability to unify our economy with our neighbors to the north and the south, it will only strengthen the President's hand as we demand that China end the trade abuses that have characterized the decades of the past. The USMCA will further strengthen our economy and create jobs at a time when other economies around the world are slowing. And it's an idea whose time has come. So I promise you: We're going to keep fighting. We're going to keep fighting for American jobs, for American opportunities, and we're going to keep fighting to get the USMCA across the line. But I came here today to the Heritage Foundation because all of you know that the greatest force this country has ever known, that has the greatest impact on the future of this nation, is always the voice of the American people. And so I want to encourage all the leaders in this room to let your voice be heard. Leave here today and do like I'm going to do: Head straight to Capitol Hill and tell the Congress to pass the USMCA for America. (Applause.) If all of us do all we can to let our voice be heard, I promise you we'll get the USMCA done, and I believe we can get it done this year. So it's great to be with all of you today at the Heritage Foundation. I thank you for coming out. I look around this room and feel like I'm watching cable television. (Laughter.) There's so many well-known faces and voices here, I'm actually very honored that you would take time to hear us out. And to come here to be part of the Heritage Foundation's long tradition of being a platform talking about how we advance the agenda and the principles that have made this country great in the past and are making America great again as we speak. I mean, the truth is, Heritage Foundation has been a bulwark. It's been a bulwark of freedom and a leading defender of the Constitution now for almost a half a century. And as I end here today, I can't help but think about the fact that it's Constitution Day; that more than two centuries ago, on this day, the Constitution was signed. And later on today, I will have the great privilege of participating in a Naturalization Ceremony with a room full of new Americans who will come to the White House to swear their allegiance to this country and swear their oath to that Constitution of the United States. But I think of the preamble of that Constitution on a day like today, and of all the years that have passed since, the words the Constitution began with that, ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution [of] the United States of America."" When they walked out of that hall in Philadelphia, history records that a little old lady walked up to Benjamin Franklin, asked him what kind of government they had created. And he said, it's ""a republic, if you can keep it."" And as I stand before you today, I have a grateful heart not just as your Vice President, but as an American, that we've kept it. We've kept it. We looked at that charge and that preamble. And all of the things that I addressed today give evidence to the fact that the American people, whatever our differences are, we have kept faith with the ideals enshrined in that Constitution. And I believe it's a day of cause for celebration and one that we ought to reflect on and be thankful for, but redouble our commitment today to stand by that Constitution, to stand by those ideals, because it's always been the wellspring of our nation's greatness. And as we keep faith with that Constitution and with the American people, I know , as people at Heritage Foundation have known for nearly 50 years , that the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come. So thank you. God bless you. God bless the Heritage Foundation. (Applause.) And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP209201954	Mike Pence	2019-09-20	Remarks by Vice President Pence and Prime Minister Morrison of Australia at a Luncheon	speech	"Prime Minister Morrison, Mrs. Jenny Morrison, Secretary Pompeo, Attorney General Barr, Secretary (inaudible) Alex Azar, my friend, other members of the Cabinet, and distinguished members of Congress who join us today, and to the entire Australian delegation: It is Karen and my honor to join the Secretary of State and Mrs. Pompeo to welcome you here to the State Department for your very first State Visit to the United States of America. (Applause.) And we've had the great privilege to spend time with you in Australia as well, and enjoyed your and Jenny's hospitality. And while, in the first instance, you did not seek the office you now hold, when the time came around to seek it, you did seek it. And so allow me, on behalf of all of my fellow Americans, to congratulate you on your success in the May elections, Mr. Prime Minister. (Applause.) The people of Australia said ""yes"" to your leadership. (Applause.) You were elected as a voice for the ""quiet Australians,"" which, if you'll permit me, reminds me of someone who was elected to represent the forgotten men and women of America. And so, you have begun your career. And I know I speak on behalf of that President when I say what a great honor it is to have you here in our country and here in our nation's capital today to celebrate, as President Trump said today, ""the unbreakable bond between America and Australia."" A bond ""rooted in eternal ties of history, [and] culture, and tradition."" And today, I truly believe that, as our as our two countries meet, as you so eloquently put it, we are on ""the dawn of a second century of mateship."" (Applause.) For more than 100 years , 101, to be exact , we have grown together, we have fought together, and freedom has prospered beneath the American flag and the Australian flag. But the relationship between our two countries is diverse and important. And nowhere is that more growing than in the bustling commerce between our two nations. Today, we're proud to say the United States is the largest investor in Australia, and you mentioned that in the Oval Office in your meeting with the President today. It makes our country the largest foreign employer in your country, but we're also very grateful that Australian companies employ more than 74,000 Americans. And exports to Australia support more than a quarter of a million Australian jobs. The economic ties and the bonds of commerce have never been stronger between the United States and Australia. (Applause.) But it's about more than commerce and business. The relationship between Australia and the United States is also characterized by our mutual commitment to freedom and our shared values. And I know I speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary of State when I say how grateful we are for the strong partnership that Australia has provided to the United States and our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. And I promise you, the United States of America will continue to stand with Australia and all freedom-loving nations for an Indo-Pacific where independent nations boldly pursue their own interests, respect their neighbors as equals; where societies, beliefs, and traditions can flourish side-by-side in a spirit of liberty. (Applause.) And we'll continue to look for new and renewed ways to build on that cooperation. We'll stand with you to uphold the freedom of navigation in the seas and in this freedom of the airways in the skies. And, let me also say, as Chairman of the National Space Council, which President Trump recently reconstituted after 25 years of dormancy, how refreshing it was to hear you reflect on our shared aspirations for renewed leadership in space. We are, indeed , as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are going back to the moon and then to Mars. And America and Australia will go together, once again. (Applause.) So, we have , we have security interests in common. We have commerce interests in common. But clearly, as I reflected when Karen and I visited Australia the first time just a few days before ANZAC Day, the greatest ties that bind our two people are the ties that have been forged by the men and women who fought and died shoulder-to-shoulder in the defense of freedom. For more than 100 years, the sons and daughters of both our lands have fought together in every major conflict to defend our shared ideals. From the Coral Sea to Kandahar, our friendship has been forged in the fires of sacrifice. Even today, in Afghanistan, Australian and American soldiers stand together. And, as the President said, ""Together, our people have laid down their lives to protect our civilization from tyranny."" We've battled together against the menace of fascism, communism, and radical Islamic terrorism. And let me say, in the faith tradition that you and , you and I share, that ours is a nation that knows that ""No greater love has a man than this, than he should lay down his life for his friends."" And for more than 100 years, it is that shared sacrifice that holds us most closely together. And I promise you, Mr. Prime Minister, the American people will never forget Australia's fallen and never fail to honor their sacrifice, along with our heroes, for our freedom. (Applause.) So, with gratitude for the extraordinary and historic alliance between the United States and Australia, and for all that it has meant to the world, and with the confident hope that we have only begun to explore the depths and bounds of prosperity and security that can be derived from this extraordinary mateship, I'd like to invite everyone to raise a glass along with me and the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister to you, Prime Minister Morrison, to Mrs. Morrison, to all the Australian people. And I will offer a toast with the blessing that you inscribed at the bottom of a letter that you sent to me not long ago. On behalf of the American people, we , we toast and we pray: May the Lord bless you and keep you and all the good people of Australia. May the Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord turn his face toward you and your good people and ours, and give us peace. God bless Australia and God bless America. (Applause.) PRIME MINISTER MORRISON: Well, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, Karen, Susan: It is a great pleasure for Jenny and I to be here with so many other Australians, who I see are in the room, and I see so many familiar faces. You pay us a great honor. Both the Secretary and the Vice President have showed great friendship towards me and to Jenny, particularly since I've come into this role. I like the Mikes. I like the Mikes. (Laughter.) I can tell you that for sure. And no, it's not just me , Ambassador Hockey and Melissa is here with us today , I, particularly in this room, want to acknowledge the tremendous work that Ambassador Hockey has done in this tremendous relationship. (Applause.) Thank you, Joe. There's no better, there's no stronger, nor any deeper relationship than that that exists between the United States and Australia. At the heart of our deep and abiding friendship are the values and beliefs that knit us together. It was just over a half a century ago that Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies , the founder of the party that I lead today , said, ""Australia and America are warmed by the same inner fires."" He said this: ""We work for the same kind of free world We live in freedom and will accept no other life. We govern ourselves in democracy and will not tolerate anything less. We cherish liberty and hold it safe, providing hope for the rest of the world. We were born in the same era, sprang from the same stock, and live for the same ideals. Australia and America share an affinity that reaches to our souls."" Australia is a reliable alliance partner but we're also a reliable economic partner as well, as the Vice President said. As a trading nation, we know we don't get rich by selling things to ourselves. We know the benefits of open markets, transparent rules, and the importance of a level playing field. We've always looked beyond our shores for our prosperity. Our ambitious trade strategy is delivering dividends. We posted a record yearly trade surplus of around $50 billion Australian, in the past year , three times larger than our previous record. One in five Australian jobs depend on global trade. When people ask me, ""Why do you go here? Why do you go there and leave our shores?"" One in five jobs in Australia depends on us doing just that. This makes us a champion for the economic success of other nations, as well as our own, because then we can do business with them. The U.S. knows the value of the products and smarts of our businesses have to offer here in the United States. The U.S. has also benefitted, as we have, significantly, from our bilateral trade and have enjoyed a trade surplus with Australia since the Truman administration. The U.S. enjoys a higher merchandised trade surplus with Australia than with any other G20 nation. And U.S. exports enter Australia tariff-free and quota-free. And you can't get a better deal than that. (Laughter and applause.) So we're very happy to be the gold standard of U.S. trade partners anywhere in the world. Together, we've invested some-1.7 trillion Australian dollars in each other's economy, with the United States being the single largest direct-investor , of any investor in our country. And more than a quarter of Australia's investment that goes beyond our shores goes here into the United States. Trade surplus or deficit, Australia will always keep our doors open, because we back ourselves. Supporting that global trading system is therefore critical to our economic success and our future. And that's why we want to work closely. And I thank the Vice President and I thank Secretary Pompeo, because we want to work closely with the United States, who is the architect of that system, to ensure that the system keeps pace with the modern digital economy, is updated to provide a level playing field between established developed economies and those that are newly established developed economies, and to protect the IP of businesses in a highly competitive global marketplace. The rules have got to reflect the changes that have happened around the world. Trade and international engagement is the bulwark against global conflict. This was the post-war vision of the nations, led by the United States, that won the great peace. And this hasn't changed, but it won't be enough. Together, we know that peace and stability cannot be taken for granted. Working together, our democracies have been the ballast in unstable times and places, guaranteeing safety and security to vulnerable people. As Australians, it has never been our response to say, ""This problem is too big or our circumstances are so trying that we should leave it to our great and powerful friend."" We have never left it to the United States. Ours is not the journey of a free rider on the sacrifice of our friends, nor will it ever be. Our defense spending will reach 2 percent of GDP next financial year. That's up from just 1.56 percent just 6 years ago, which was the lowest level it had been since the Second World War , before the Second World War. At that level, we're second only to the United States of the Five Eyes nations, and greater than those much larger nations like Germany and Japan. We take our responsibility in our own neighborhood very seriously. In our Pacific step-up, which I want to thank the Vice President for his keen interest, both in that partnership that we are forging in the Pacific, but his commitment and interest and passion for the Pacific. We talk about it as our Pacific family. ""Matavuvale,"" if you're in Fiji. (Inaudible), if you're in Polynesia , to promote shared prosperity, independence, and sovereignty. In the broader Asia-Pacific, we have forged deep friendships with partnerships over decades with our ASEAN neighbors, with India, and Japan, Korea. And we share a comprehensive strategic partnership with China, our single-largest trading partner. Where we have had success with partners in our region, it has always been built on mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, and to celebrate their economic success. It has also been made possible by our alliance with the United States. And your presence and engagement in our region, which is so important because it provides the necessary stability in our region to pursue these relationships. Sustained U.S. and economic and security engagement in the Indo-Pacific has never been more necessary. Beyond our region, we share a commitment to the sovereignty, also, and prosperity of Israel. For 70 years , and especially recently , we have, in Australia, together, consistently advocated for the nation of Israel and for a peaceful future for the region. Most recently, under my government, we have taken an even stronger stand against the biased and unfair targeting of Israel in the U.N. General Assembly, together with the United States. And, Mr. Vice President, we will continue to do so. (Applause.) Australia may not be America's most powerful friend, but we are certainly, as I said this morning, your most sure and steadfast. We have just celebrated a century of mateship. And at the dawn of a second century of mateship, we draw strength from what we have achieved together so far. We commit to modernizing our alliance for the times and challenges we now face and we renew our belief in the values that will always sustain us in this endeavor. So let me also propose a toast, not just to the Mikes , (laughter) , but to the Commonwealth of Australia, but importantly, to these United States of America, and to the better world we have always believed in and told together to achieve. God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1371743/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-and-prime-minister-morrison-of-australia-at-a-luncheon&speechType=1	Trade		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-prime-minister-morrison-australia-luncheon/
VSMP239201953	Mike Pence	2019-09-23	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the United Nations Event on Religious Freedom | New York, NY	speech	VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General Guterres, Ambassador Craft, Mr. Secretary Pompeo, members of the Cabinet, distinguished members of Congress, world leaders, and most especially to the courageous men and women who join us here today who have suffered persecution and violence for simply living out your faith , whether that be Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam , it is my great honor to be here today with the President of the United States to reaffirm America's commitment to what the people of our nation have always believed: that every person is endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. And Americans have always believed our first freedom is the freedom of religion. Today, President Donald Trump becomes the first American President to convene a meeting, here at the United Nations, on religious freedom. And it is my great honor to introduce him. (Applause.) And there's no better time for a meeting like this on the world stage. As we gather here at the United Nations, more than 80 percent of the world's population live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or banned. The regime in Iran brutally persecutes Christians, Sunnis, Bahai'i, and Jews. In Iraq, Iran-backed militias terrorize Christians and Yazidis who were nearly wiped out by ISIS's recent campaign of genocide. The Communist Party in China has arrested Christian pastors, banned the sale of Bibles, demolished churches, and imprisoned more than a million Uighurs in the Muslim population. In our hemisphere, the regime of Daniel Ortega is virtually waging war on the Catholic Church in Nicaragua. And in Venezuela, the dictator Nicolás Maduro uses anti-hate laws to prosecute clergy, even as his media cronies spread anti-Semitism by trivializing the Holocaust. Communities of faith across the wider world have also faced unspeakable acts of violence in places of worship, shocking the conscience of the world. In October, 11 Jews were murdered in the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In March, a gunman killed 51 Muslims at prayer in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. And just a month later, suicide bombers murdered more than 300 Christians during Easter services at three Christian churches in Sri Lanka. These attacks strike at the heart of everything free peoples hold sacred. And the threats of religious freedom and the attacks on people of faith underscore why President Trump has taken such decisive action, since the very first days of our administration, to build and promote our nation's proud tradition of advancing religious freedom. And that continues today. At the President's direction, the United States created the Genocide Recovery and Persecution Response Program, and we've provided more than $370 million to aid ethnic minorities in faith communities persecuted by ISIS in Iraq and throughout the region. Earlier this year, at the President's direction, the Secretary of State held the second annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, inviting more than a thousand civil society and religious leaders, in 100 different nations, to the largest event of its kind in the world. And last year, at the inaugural ministerial, at the President's direction, we established the International Religious Freedom Fund, which already has received nearly $5 million in pledges and given over 435 Rapid Response Grants to those persecuted for their deeply held beliefs. And to date, this effort has helped some 2,000 victims of religious persecution around the world. As the President often says, America is a nation of faith, and we will always stand for the freedom of religion of every person, of every race and every creed, to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. And today, giving evidence of his passion for religious liberty, the President will announce additional steps that the United States will take to protect religious liberty and defend people of faith around the world. This is a very special day. And I always say it is a high honor to introduce this President. But to be here, at this historic gathering with leaders around the world, standing for our first freedom of religious liberty is among the greatest honors I've ever had. And so let me say, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you a tireless champion of the freedom of religion and people of every faith in America and around the world, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.

VSMP279201951	Mike Pence	2019-09-27	Remarks by Vice President Pence During a Roundtable Discussion at the NeuroDiagnostic Institute and Advanced Treat ...	speech	Well, thank you all for being here. And I'm especially grateful to the distinguished leaders in healthcare, drug abuse and prevention in this state, as well as some great friends and a great colleague from our nation's capital. It's great to be back home in Indiana. We've had a great couple of days. I was yesterday on the east side of Indianapolis, talking about creating jobs with the largest new trade deal in American history. I had a chance to stop by an elementary school in my hometown because they invited me earlier today. A third grade class at Southside Elementary asked me to come in, and we've kind of been pen pals for a while. And that was a great thrill. I stopped by to see our troops at Camp Atterbury, who are preparing to deploy. But I have to tell you, it is a joy for me to be back here at the NeuroDiagnostic Institute, which is an extraordinary statement about Indiana's leadership in the whole area of mental health and also in combatting opioid abuse and addiction. I specifically want to thank the Surgeon General of the United States , my friend, Dr. Jerome Adams , for being here and for his tremendous work on combatting opioid abuse and addiction. We are encouraged that, nationwide, in the last year we've seen a 5 percent reduction in overdose deaths from opioid abuse. And it is a beginning of progress, but one that our administration and I know Dr. Adams is absolutely determined to continue to build on that. But we're grateful that you'd be here with us, and thank you for your service to the country. I'm also grateful to be joined by a former colleague of mine when I had my last job in this state. Dr. Jennifer Sullivan is now the head of Indiana Family and Social Services. And this NeuroDiagnostic Institute is a project of the state of Indiana, and Community East really represents the very best of a public and private partnership. And, Dr. Sullivan, I want to thank you for your great leadership in helping to bring it about. Also, I want to congratulate Dr. Jerry Sheward for his great work here. He's the superintendent and the chief medical officer here at NDI, and, I think as of this spring, stood up this extraordinary institution, which is, in fact, the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in a half a century. And it was my great privilege to break ground at this site in my last year as Governor of the state of Indiana. And to be back here, Dr. Sheward and Dr. Sullivan, and to see this magnificent building, which is already meeting the needs of patients, is a great tribute to your efforts, to your leadership, and to the leadership the state of Indiana has brought to this project. I'm grateful, as a Vice President of the United States, to see a state leading on a renewed commitment to mental health. But I'm also proud, as a Hoosier, to see the state of Indiana really creating a model for other communities and other states around the nation to address the challenges that we face from not only drug abuse and addiction, but also the challenges that mental health pose to public safety. And I want to speak about that in our roundtable today. I want to extend to you the gratitude and the greetings of the President of the United States. I told President Trump that I would be here. And I can assure you, as we can have been confronting this crisis of opioid abuse and addiction since early in this administration, and as we have been dealing as a nation with unspeakable acts of violence, most recently in Texas and in Ohio, that there is at least evidence , are driven by individuals with deep mental illness. This example in Indiana , of the state of Indiana making a commitment to expand facilities here , really represents a model for the nation. And the President and I have talked about it frequently. And, Bryan Mills, I want to commend you and Community Hospital for really partnering with the state of Indiana to make this a reality. I was , I was mentioning the fact that we've seen a 5 percent reduction in opioid overdoses nationwide. But if the statistics hold, Indiana is looking at roughly a 12 percent reduction in deaths from opioid overdoses. And that is a tribute to Governor Eric Holcomb, to this administration's commitment to combatting opioid abuse and addiction, to strong law enforcement efforts, but it's also a tribute to the healthcare community in this state. And so I want to extend to you our gratitude. It's amazing to think a reduction in overdoses , the number of lives that are saved in this state and around this country. And I just want to assure you that as we talk about expanding mental health services here in the state of Indiana, I'm going to be taking this back before the end of the day to meet with the President and share with him what Indiana has been able to do here and our determination to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to address the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction, to address the needs of mental health in this country, with national solutions. The President truly believes that, in the wake of mass shootings that not only beset Texas and Ohio, but in our tenure, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas, and other days that just broke the heart of the American people , we believe part of the answer is strong law enforcement; part of the answer is prevention. But we also believe , the President and I believe strongly that part of the answer is a renewed commitment to mental health in the United States. And I'm incredibly proud that Indiana is leading the way. And with the construction of this beautiful NeuroDiagnostic Institute , the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in 50 years , I want to congratulate each of you on really providing a model for other states around the country and an inspiration to leaders in our nation's capital to do more in the area of mental health. So, thank you very much. And, Dr. Adams, thank you again for being here.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1373715/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-during-a-roundtable-discussion-at-the-neurodiagnostic-institute-and-advanced-treatment-center&speechType=1	Health and Health Care Drugs		Indianapolis, IN	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-roundtable-discussion-neurodiagnostic-institute-advanced-treatment-center/
VSMP279201952	Mike Pence	2019-09-27	Remarks by Vice President Pence to the Indiana National Guard | Edinburgh, IN	speech	"Well, thank you very much. Thank you to the Acting Adjutant General , Brigadier General Timothy Winslow. He is a great Hoosier, an aviator with more than 2,500 hours of flight time , a man who's dedicated 33 years of service in the Indiana National Guard. So let me encourage you to be at ease and give a big round of applause for your Acting Adjutant General. Thank you, General. (Applause.) Thanks for (inaudible). It is great to be back home again, especially to be at Camp Atterbury, with so many men and women, and citizen soldiers who have stepped forward to serve our state and our nation. I can tell you, I serve as Vice President of the United States today, but I will always count it among the highest honors of my life when, as your Governor, I was the Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard. America is proud of the Indiana National Guard. Give yourselves a round of applause. You really set the pace. (Applause.) You really do. We've got the Ironman unit here. We've got the Bulldog unit. And I know you all are getting ready to go downrange. And I just had to come by. I had to come by after a brief stop down in my hometown of Columbus just to say thank you. Thank you for your service. I want you also to say thank you to your families. How about a round of applause for the spouses, and the parents, and the family members that support you as you serve our nation? (Applause.) And before we get done clapping, let me give you one more chance , I'm going to be with him a little bit later today when I arrive back at the White House. But I know he would want me to extend his greetings and his gratitude to each and every one of you. So allow me to extend the great respect and the appreciation of your Commander-in-Chief , the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I hope all my fellow Hoosiers here are as proud as I am of the support that this President and this administration have provided to our men and women in uniform. I'm proud to report to you that, under this administration , and, frankly, the strong bipartisan support in Congress , we've actually seen the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest pay raise for men and women in uniform in more than 10 years. We're standing by each and every one of you as never before. And my commitment to each one of you, as your Vice President and on behalf of our President, is we're going to continue to make sure that you have the resources, the support, the equipment, and the training to accomplish your mission and defend this nation. That's our promise to each and every one of you. (Applause.) And I don't have to tell all of you, as you prepare for a deployment downrange in the next several months, that you know , literally since that , since that , since the founding of our country, citizen soldiers have played a vital role. The National Guard has been a part of our national defense. But since that day 18 years ago that we remembered earlier this month, the National Guard and the Indiana National Guard have been at the tip of the spear, and many of you have already been downrange several different times, playing a vital role in the global war on terror. And it's remarkable to think that the role that each one of you played in those deployments has made an incredible difference. I'm told actually that, since September 11th, more than 15,000 Indiana Army National Guard and 3,500 Indiana Air Guard have supported the global war on terror through deployments overseas. And as we mark that 18th anniversary, let me just say: On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you to the Indiana National Guard, the Indiana Air Guard for what you've done to protect this nation for all those 18 years. Give yourselves another round of applause. You've made an incredible difference. (Applause.) You've also played a critical role. I have to tell you, since going back to Washington, D.C., I've been awfully proud to hear reports of the way the Indiana National Guard has stepped forward following hurricanes and major weather events and disasters. It just seems like every single time that these events take place in our communities, somebody pulls me aside in Washington, D.C., and says, ""You know, the Indiana National Guard was one of the first units down there making a difference."" And I couldn't be more proud of that. Now, this is a great group. There are, I'm told, 300 engineers here today; about 85 military police preparing to deploy into Afghanistan; the engineers to Kuwait. But each one of you has your own personal story. And I was particularly moved, as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a United States Marine, to know that there is a father-son unit getting ready to deploy. And I don't know , I got to find out from somebody if that's ever happened before in the history of the Indiana National Guard. But it just underscores the commitment of families in this state to our national defense. So would you join me in congratulating and thanking First Sergeant Brian Schultheis and Lieutenant Brett Schultheis? Where are you guys? Put your hands in the air. (Applause.) Thank you. I know how proud you are, and I know how nervous you are going downrange with your dad. I appreciate both of you, and I appreciate your family. And it really is amazing to see you all here today. As I mentioned, it was probably one of the greatest honors of my life when I was Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard as your governor. Thirteen thousand men and women. It's amazing to think Indiana is not the seventh-largest state in America, but we boast the seventh-largest National Guard in this country. And that says an awful lot about families in this state and the commitment to providing for the common defense. And so I just wanted to come by and really say two things. First and foremost, thank you for your service. Thank you for stepping up for Indiana and for America. And secondly, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I just encourage you: Take the opportunity to be ready, which is the motto of Camp Atterbury and has been for decades. Use this time of training to sharpen yourselves and be prepared to deploy and bring real excellence and professionalism to this effort. Be vigilant. Respect the unified chain of command. Trust your superiors. Trust your orders. Mind your people and mind your mission. And know that the American people are counting on you, because we know we can. You know, I stand before you today, and the last thing I would say to each one of you is, from the bottom of my heart , is just: Thank you. Thank you for stepping forward in this all-volunteer military. Thank you for being the citizen soldiers that the National Guard are here in Indiana and all across America. Know that you go with the confidence of you Commander-in-Chief. Know that you go with the gratitude of the people of Indiana and this nation. But also know that you go with the prayers of people all across this state. And be assured of that as you prepare for deployment, as you go downrange, that you will be carried by the prayers of the people of Indiana and the people of this country. We will pray every day that no harm would befall you, no danger would come near you, and that you would do your job protecting this nation and return home safe to your families. That, we will pray. So thank you very much. God bless the Indiana National Guard. God bless the Hoosier State. And God bless America. It's great to be home.

VSMP309201950	Mike Pence	2019-09-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence at an Armed Forces Welcome Ceremony in Honor of the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chi ...	speech	"11:44 A.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr. President, Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and especially the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States: It's an honor to be here, at ""America's post"" , the home of the oldest active-duty infantry unit in the Army, the Old Guard , at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, as we install the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark A. Milley. (Applause.) Today, as we mark the beginning of General Milley's tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we do well to pay a debt of gratitude to a man who has served this nation with distinction for now 42 years. He led troops in battle during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He served as Commandant of the Marine Corps. And over the past five years, I can personally attest, during our tenure, I have witnessed his strong leadership and sound counsel at the highest levels of our military and our government. Today, we may a debt of gratitude to General Joseph F. Dunford. Thank you for your service. Thank you for being always faithful. (Applause.) And to General Milley, the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: I know I speak on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief and a grateful nation when I say to you and to your family, thank you for answering the call to serve once again. Over your nearly 40-year career, you've served with courage and distinction as a Green Beret. You've led troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. You served as the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army. And as your tenure begins, General Milley, let me assure you, you have the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief, and you are carried with the confidence and the prayers of the American people. Thank you for your leadership and service. (Applause.) And, General Milley, as your tenure as Chairman begins, I know that you'll be pleased to know that, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, you are inheriting the best-equipped, best-supplied, and best-trained military in the history of the world. The United States military is the greatest force for good the world has ever known. And since the first day of this administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of this planet stronger still. After years of budget cuts, President Trump fought for and secured the largest investment in our national defense in more than a generation, including the largest pay raise for our troops in more than a decade. (Applause.) And at the President's direction, we produced a National Security Strategy that puts America first. Initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before. And with the strong support of leaders in Congress, we're well on our way, at the President's direction, to establishing the sixth branch of our Armed Forces. The United States Space Force will soon be a reality. (Applause.) And finally, Chairman Milley, as you know, this summer, thanks to the President's strong leadership, Congress approved a budget deal that preserves the historic investments we've made in our national defense. It provides for our veterans and ends the defense sequester once and for all. The American people know that President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of this nation. And today, by providing renewed leadership to the Joint Chiefs in General Mark Milley, President Trump is proving once again that as Commander-in-Chief, he will provide for the common defense with unyielding strength. And as he said, ""We will defend our country, we will defend our people."" It is my great honor to be with all of you and most especially with all of those who wear the uniform of our Armed Forces gathered here today, and all who are gathered here who have worn the uniform of the United States. And on this momentous occasion of the transfer of responsibility to the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce your Commander-in-Chief and a great champion of all the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, past, present, and future: the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump.

VSMP710201949	Mike Pence	2019-10-07	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement | Goodlettsville, TN	speech	"1:40 P.M. CDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Tennessee! (Applause.) And I want to , I want to thank my friend, Secretary Sonny Perdue. He was a governor who transformed the state of Georgia. And I got to tell you, other than my friend who I work with every single day, there is no greater champion for agriculture in America than the 31st Secretary of Agriculture for the United States of America. Join me in thanking Secretary Sonny Perdue. He is an incredible champion. (Applause.) Stand up, Sonny. Take a bow. (Applause.) To Mr. Secretary, to your governor, to the members of Congress, to distinguished guests, but most of all, it's a joy to be here at Tyson with Noel White and the men and women of this great company , a legendary American company that sets the pace, that packages the food that feeds America and feeds the world. Congratulations, Tyson. Give yourselves a big round of applause. (Applause.) Great. It's true. It really is great to be back in the Volunteer State. And it's also a special honor and a joy for me to be here with an American that I've really come to admire , him and his family , as someone who built a successful career in business, who's a man of integrity, who came to be known for his values and his vision. He's a lifelong Tennessean. But he stepped forward not long ago to help lead this state as your governor, and he's already making an incredible difference in the lives of people across Tennessee. Would you join me in thanking Governor Bill Lee for doing a great job for the people of Tennessee? (Applause.) This state and this country are proud, Bill. And thank you all for that. It really is great to be here with so many friends. I'm going to mention a few more of them along the way. But before we get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. I was talking to him on Air Force Two, right when we were coming in for a landing. He's a man who loves the state of Tennessee and has been fighting to keep all the promises that he made to the people of Tennessee in 2016. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And thank you all. Thanks for the wonderful, warm welcome. It's , it really is great to be here. Great to be here with so many with great Americans, and standing and having a chance to walk through a great American company. It's amazing to think, now going on almost 100 years, Tyson Foods has been an inspiring story of the American Dream. It's remarkable to reflect on the fact this company, I'm told, started with one man from a small town in the depths of the Great Depression. He moved his family to Arkansas in a beat-up old truck with only a nickel in his pocket and half a load of hay. That's impressive. (Laughter.) But John Tyson started hauling live chickens to cities like Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago. And in a few years, he opened his own chicken hatchery and feed business, and the rest is history. Now, a little more than 90 years later, one out of every five pounds of chicken, beef, and pork sold in America is produced by Tyson. That is a story of the American Dream. (Applause.) Wow. And as Noel and I were talking , because of the extraordinary success of this great company, Tyson supports more than 10,000 farmers and has created more than 100,000 American jobs. And, of course, Tyson exports its , all of its goods around the world, feeding the world as well. And I was pleased to hear today that Tyson is growing. In fact, as we speak, Tyson is building another poultry facility in Western Tennessee that, I'm told, is going to support 70 farmers and create another 1,500 jobs right here in the Volunteer State. Thank you, Noel. (Applause.) Governor Lee is smiling about that news. (Laughter.) But I'm here today because we've got work to do, men and women. I'm here today on the President's behalf because we've got an incredible opportunity in front of us. As I stand before you, we have before the Congress of the United States what, once it is approved, will be the largest trade deal in American history. So I came to Tennessee today to say it's time for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and pass it this year. (Applause.) So we're going to talk about trade today, which Tyson knows just a little bit about , exporting, as it does, literally all over the world, supporting jobs across Tennessee and across America. We're going to talk about a great opportunity for Tennessee workers and Tennessee businesses. But before that, let me reflect on the progress we've made because of the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and our administration back in 2016. You know, when I think of the last two and a half years, there's only one way I can describe it. It's been two and a half years of action. (Applause.) Two and a half years of results. (Applause.) It's been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Tennessee! (Applause.) I mean, when you think of what this President has accomplished with our strong allies in Congress, it's truly remarkable. At a time when too many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election, I know the American people are encouraged to see that this President, this Vice President, and this administration will never stop fighting for the policies that Tennessee said yes to in 2016. (Applause.) A strong national defense, secure borders, our God-given liberties, and jobs, jobs, jobs. (Applause.) That's what we're fighting for. But I'm here to say that Tennessee and America are now looking to this Democrat majority in the Congress to do their job , to do a job for the American people. It's time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress to set politics aside and pass the USMCA. It's a win for Tennessee and a win for America. (Applause.) You know, I really believe the American people don't want more partisanship; we want more jobs. We don't want more resistance; we want more results, more trade and more exports. And that's what will come when we approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. And when we pass the USMCA, I'm proud to report that we're going to be building on an incredible amount of progress that the American people have accomplished over the last two and a half years. It's amazing to think, after eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, the American economy is booming. The American economy has come roaring back because President Donald Trump has kept the promises he made to Tennessee to revive this economy. (Applause.) Think about it. I mean, the President said we could revive the economy if we simply put commonsense, free-market principles into practice; if we said ""yes"" again to the timeless American principles and practices that have always revived our free enterprise system. Right after we were elected, we went right to work. We cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms. This President has actually signed more bills, rolling back federal red tape already, than any President in American history. (Applause.) We unleashed American energy, and I'm proud to report there's an energy renaissance happening across this country. And this year, for the first time in 75 years, America will be a net-exporter of oil. (Applause.) We're on the road to energy independence. And in the midst of all of that, this President also pledged to fight for free, fair, and, what he likes to call, reciprocal trading agreements with our trading partners. And we've been doing just that. The results , I don't have to tell you, in a prospering company like Tyson , have truly been remarkable. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country, in the city and on the farm, have literally created 6.5 million new jobs. That includes 130,000 jobs right here in the state of Tennessee. (Applause.) In fact, we just confirmed on Friday that unemployment has now hit a 51-year low, and it's the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) And since President Trump was elected, the average American household has literally seen disposable income go up by more than $5,000 a year. And maybe most importantly to the President and me is that wages are rising at their fastest pace in a decade, and they're rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) Now, all that didn't just happen. It happened because of the policies that Tennessee supported, because of our allies in Congress who came alongside this President as we were busy cutting taxes, rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, and fighting for fair trade deals. They helped us put in place these policies that really revived the American economy. But what really brought the economy back was all of you. It was that men and women , hardworking Americans in businesses just like Tysons , seized on the opportunities. You expanded freedom in the free market across this country to create jobs and opportunity. I mean, the truth of the matter is , the Governor will back me up on this , the people of Tennessee and America are the greatest workers in the world, and our businesses can compete with any business anywhere. (Applause.) But it's all about the people. And Noel and I were talking about what a great team you have here. People like, I heard, someone who actually served alongside our armed forces overseas in Iraq. He's a man who grew up in Baghdad, and, after helping our troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom, he came to this country. He was actually an interpreter in Iraq. And once he arrived here, he got a job with Tyson. Within a year, I'm told, he was promoted to management, and he's been promoted several more times in the 10 years that has followed. And now, he's an operations manager here at this facility, leading more than 1,600 employees every day. So would you would join me in a big round of applause for Falah Al-Sadawi. Where are you, Falah? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. What a good man. Thank you, Falah. And there's another person I was told about when I got here , a woman who grew up in a small town in Cuba. She had dreams of someday coming to America, enjoying the fruits of freedom. Twenty years ago, she fled the Castro regime in Havana and lived her dream coming to the United States. A few years after that, she was hired by Tyson and given the opportunity she's had in this company. And now she's actually been promoted to production supervisor. So would you join me in another big round of applause for somebody out there living the dream here at Tyson: Lisette Martin. Where are you, Lisette? (Applause.) Proud of you. We're so grateful to Falah, we're so grateful to Lisette, for their example, for their courage, and for their incredible professionalism here at this company. And , but I mentioned each one of them, frankly, because they're just emblematic of all of you. I mean, the truth of the matter is that all the employees here at Tyson show every day that, as long as the playing field is level, American companies and workers can compete and win anywhere in the world. So give yourselves a round of applause, Team Tyson. (Applause.) You're the best. But the President and I understand that opening up markets around the world is critical to the success of companies across this country , and most especially, it's true in agriculture. That's why, since the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to open up markets around the world. We negotiated a new trade agreement with South Korea. And earlier today, we announced that the Secretary of the Treasury and our Trade Representative are going to welcome a Chinese delegation, led by the Vice Premier, to continue negotiations this week. But the President is going to continue to stand strong. We've put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over. (Applause.) And I promise you , I promise you, this President is going to continue to stand firm, not just to open up markets to our goods in china, but to have China once again , ""finally,"" rather , agree to embrace the international rules that govern commerce and protect American property and assets. Now, later this afternoon, there is also some good news. I think, before I leave Tyson today, the President is going to have signed two new agreements with Japan that will expand not only digital trade, but will expand agricultural exports by billions of dollars a year to Japan. (Applause.) And we're in discussions with the European Union. Once the UK makes its way through Brexit, we'll be negotiating a free trade agreement with them. So we've been very busy opening up markets. But the USMCA is what brought me here today. Because the truth is, in negotiating the USMCA, the President did negotiate the largest trade deal in American history. And it's a win for agriculture, it's a win for Tennessee, and it's a win for America. And I came here today to call on the people of Tennessee to join us in this cause and let your voice be heard. The truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is projected to add $68 billion to our economy and create 176,000 new jobs. And that's just in the early going. It's also estimated the USMCA would increase annual American agricultural exports by $2.2 billion. Now, I've got to tell you: The numbers are impressive, but I think all of you here at Tyson know that means , that means jobs, that means prosperity in this company, in this state, in this nation. That's why I'm traveling all over the country and the President is making the case that for the sake of the American farmer, for the sake of American business, we need Congress to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) Now, the USMCA is also going to expand access to Canada's market for poultry, which is something Tyson knows more than a little bit about. Under the agreement, Canada would actually increase access to imports of American chicken by 10,000 metric tons within the first six years, and then increase it by one percent for the next 10 years. In addition, it'll allow the United States to export up to 1,000 metric tons of turkey products every year for 10 years, and potentially a lot more than that. According to one estimate, poultry meat exports to Canada would increase by more than $180 million, or nearly 50 percent, within the six years after USMCA becomes law. And this is an extraordinary statement about what this is going to mean to producers and to companies just like Tyson and to all of the tens of thousands of Americans that are employed in this industry and around it. I mean, Tyson has a lot to gain in the USMCA. And, I mean, Mexico is actually, I'm told, Tyson's top export market overall. And so, I wanted to come here and make sure all the good people working at Tyson knew just how important and how good this agreement would be for your industry. It's good for Tennessee, too. I mean, Tennessee already exports more than $7.8 billion in goods and services to Canada today. And under the USMCA, the Governor and I are confident that that number is only going to grow, which is going to create even more jobs, more opportunity, and more prosperity right here in Tennessee. And so, for the thousands of men and women of Tyson, for millions of citizens across Tennessee, and for America, we need to get this done; we need to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) And I'll tell you what: This President is , he's impatient for it. (Laughter.) Because for all of the progress our country has made, that's just what this businessman-turned-President calls a ""good start."" I mean, the truth is, we need Congress to approve the USMCA and approve it this year because we want to keep the momentum in this economy. But to make that happen , the reason I came to Tennessee today is because you all are going to be the difference. I mean, Congress knows where the President stands. Congress knows where I stand. But I want to encourage each and every one of you, maybe even before the day is out, to let your voice be heard and talk about what this agreement would mean not just to this company and to your family, but to this state and this nation. I mean, I want to encourage you to reach out to our elected officials who represent us in Washington, D.C. Tell them how this agreement is going to level the playing field. Those numbers that I just gave you are just the beginning. I mean, tell your elected officials how this agreement is going to lead to more jobs, more job security, more investment, right here in Tennessee. You know, I served in Congress for 12 years. It seemed longer. (Laughter.) But the one thing I know is the most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is not your cable news networks, right? Not your social media. Not your special interests groups. The most powerful voice , force , in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people. So reach out to everyone who represents Tennessee in Washington, and tell them the Volunteer State needs the USMCA, and we need it this year. (Applause.) You can be the difference. But let me say, with a grateful heart , I'll save you a nickel , you sure don't need to call Senator Lamar Alexander or Senator Marsha Blackburn because they are leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate. (Applause.) They are. Two outstanding leaders; tremendously respected. And they're working the hallways, they're working the floor of the Senate, and they're working the airwaves of America, telling this story. You just call them and tell them you appreciate it. And also, there's a number of members of Congress that you don't need to call, several of which are actually with us today. They're strong, principled conservatives who have been there every step of the way with this administration. I'm going to name them one at a time and ask them to stand. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, would you stand up? This is a great, great voice for jobs and conservative values in Washington. (Applause.) Thank you, Congressman. Congressman David Kustoff. Congressman, stand up. Thank you for your strong stand. (Applause.) Thank you, David. Congressman John Rose has been there fighting the good fight to expand jobs and opportunities. (Applause.) And Congressman Tim Burchett. Stand up there, Tim, will you? Thank you so much. (Applause.) These are four conservative champions in the House of Representatives. They've been fighting for the USMCA. And everyone in Tennessee can be proud of this group of congressmen. Give them one more round. This is a group of stars. (Applause.) But there are a few members of your delegation that you could call. (Laughter.) You know, and I kind of always had the view, when I was in Congress, that, you know, if you're part of a delegation from a state, you kind of represent everybody in the state, right? You're elected to a district, but you're part of your state's delegation. So, right after you get done thanking the people that are standing with us, why don't you call Congressman Jim Cooper and call Congressman Steve Cohen, and tell them Tennessee needs the USMCA, and we need it this year. (Applause.) And while you reach out to them directly, make sure , you know, let your voice be heard. I mean, send a letter to the Nashville Tennessean. Call a local talk radio show. Because I just really do believe, when the American people let their voice be heard , I used to call it the ""gale force wind of do something."" When that hits Capitol Hill, Congress gets off the dime. And that's what we need to have happen. For the sake of our economy and for the sake of our future prosperity, we've got to get it done. Make no mistake about it: Your voice , your voice will make a difference. So let your voice be heard. Now, listen, I want to thank you for coming out today. I look forward to saying hello to as many of you as time permits. And I truly am grateful , I'm grateful for the warm hospitality today. I really am. And while I'm at it, can I just say, on behalf of myself and my family, to the people of Tennessee: Thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President. Thank you for the confidence you've placed (inaudible). (Applause.) It's the greatest honor of my life. And it's hard for me to describe the privilege that I feel in this role, and the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and in his Vice President. And I never want to miss the opportunity to pay a debt of gratitude to each of you. And I promise you: Not only am I grateful, but you also have my promise that the President and I are going to keep on fighting. We're going to keep on fighting for all the things that Tennessee voted for this President to do. Things that we've gotten done already that have revived this economy. We've stood by American agriculture. We've rebuilt our military. We've appointed more than 150 conservatives to our federal courts at every level. (Applause.) America is standing strong and America is standing tall again, and we're going to keep fighting. (Applause.) And I have faith that our best days are ahead , not just for Tennessee, but for all of America. Even in these divided times, I'm absolutely convinced , I'm absolutely convinced that as we continue to deliver on the timeless ideals of the American people, that the American people are going to keep standing with us. But we got to stay in it. We've got to stay in the fight. We've got to keep building on the momentum. That really is what today is all about. And we've got to have faith in each other. And I think, if I can say, it's something that Bill Lee and I connected on early on, that we've got to have that other kind of faith too. (Applause.) You know, I , it seems like you turn on the television anymore and there's so much emphasis on what divides us in this country, but I'll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us. And chief among those things is faith. I mean, everywhere I go , I heard it today when I got off the plane at the airport , people reaching out and grabbing a hand, people from every walk of life just telling you: ""Tell the President and you, we're praying for you."" I mean, this is a believing nation. And on that foundation, I think we can be confident that whatever challenges we face today, we'll find our way through as Americans to an even brighter future for our children and our grandchildren. And I can't help but think of how many times in that book I try and open every morning that they talk about the farmer. And I looked at a verse in James, Chapter Five, that said: Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the rain in the fall and in the spring, and you too must be patient and have courage. So in these challenging times, let's consider the farmer. Let's continue to advance policies that will create prosperity for the farmer. But let's also be inspired by the steady example of faith and perseverance that has always been and will always be emblematic of the farm. So I want to thank you for the opportunity to be with you today. And I'm absolutely convinced that with your continued support, with your help and your voice, we'll get the USMCA passed into law. We'll continue to build on the momentum in this economy, making America more strong and more secure. And with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God's help, we will keep America great. (Applause.) Thanks, everybody. God bless you. God bless Tennessee. And God bless America.

VSMP1010201948	Mike Pence	2019-10-10	Remarks by Vice President Pence During Visit to Safety Signs | Lakeville, MN	speech	"Well, hello, Minnesota! (Applause.) It is exciting to be here at Safety Signs. What a dynamic, growing family-owned business and a success story. Join me in thanking Sue and Jay Blanchard for your leadership, your commitment to this community , (applause) , and your example of the American Dream. Come on up on the stage. I don't know what the , I don't know if they paid for , come on. (Applause.) That's great. Great. Come back up here, Karen. I'll tell you, I'm glad , I really appreciate , and the Secretary of Labor has literally been on the job for like a week. But he is an extraordinary American and he's going to be a great, great champion for working Americans all across this nation. Join me in thanking Secretary Eugene Scalia one more time, will you? The Secretary of Labor. (Applause.) And I want to thank our host, Generra Peck. Generra that was like the shortest trade work speech I've ever heard in my life. (Laughter.) She must know I got somewhere else to be. (Laughter.) But give them a round of applause. They put together today for us. (Applause.) And, Generra, we appreciate you. Great job. And it is a special delight here to be with the woman to my right. We loaded up our two dogs and our cat , (laughter) , and headed to Minnesota today. We've been married 34 years, and I'll tell you what: She is a champion for military families. She is a champion for art therapy all across the nation. And I'll tell you what: She is, I think, the greatest Second Lady this country has ever had. Would you join me in thanking Karen Pence? She's just doing an incredible job. (Applause.) Thank you, sweetheart. And I would not correct the Secretary lightly, but he did say there's no one who's worked harder for the progress that this economy has made than me. But I might have one correction. There's somebody else who I promise you has never stopped fighting to create jobs, a more prosperous and a more secure America. So, Minnesota, before he's wheels down, let me bring greetings to Safety Signs from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, I know Sue and Jay will appreciate this comment the President said not long ago: ""Small-business owners embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement."" And that really is the story. That's the story of the Blanchard family and of Safety Signs. And these are two people who have built a great business. I'm looking out on a lot of great employees here. And give yourselves a round of applause. The success of this company is owing to each and every one of you. (Applause.) But, you know, this isn't just a great employer, it isn't just a great small business. It's also a great , a great corporate citizen. And these are , these are two great, proud graduates of St. Cloud State University. But, in 2016, I'm actually told, they were named Lakeville Chamber of Commerce Community Business Partners of the Year for everything that they have done to improve this community , from the 9/11 Never Forget Memorial, to the VFW mobile Vietnam Wall. And all other community organizations, thank you for making Safety Signs and your family such a part of what makes this community special. We're really proud of you. (Applause.) Thank you, Sue. Great job. Really great job. And I know it's a family affair. Jay just made the point that I grew up in a small business in southern Indiana, south of Highway 40. We had a gas station business. Had three brothers and two sisters, and so I know what it is to be in a family business. So I don't want to , I don't want to miss mentioning your three kids: Isabel, Jake, and your oldest daughter, Karlee. I don't know if they're here with us today, but give us a wave over here. Let's hear it for this great family. (Applause.) And especially Karlee, who had the good sense to graduate from Notre Dame University in Indiana. Well done, Karlee. (Applause.) I actually had the privilege of speaking at her commencement that year. And what a great accomplishment. I know your parents are so , so, so proud of each and every one of you. Now, we , we're gathering in a place that has a motto: ""Whatever it takes."" I know you all live by that every day. You're working on tighter and tighter deadlines because Safety Signs is getting busier every day in this bustling economy. And I'll tell you what: I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who, from the first day of this administration, has been working to get the economy of Minnesota moving and the economy of America moving. And right out of the gate, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses just like this one, family farmers. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history already. And as you all see happening right here in northern Minnesota, we've unleashed American energy. We have an energy revolution happening all across this nation, and the results have been amazing. (Applause.) The results have truly been amazing. The economy , as a Secretary just told you , more than 6 million new jobs in the last three years. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. There's more Americans working today than ever before. But I'll tell you what: What actually means the most to the President and me , and I'll say this to Jay and Sue , is that wages are rising all across America in the last two years, and they're rising most rapidly for hardworking blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. This economy is working. (Applause.) It's working for working people. But I came here today, with the support of this great trade work script, to tell you that, in addition, we think to let people keep more of what they earn and making sure you don't have a lot of red tape on your business so you can grow and thrive, and making sure that , making sure that we have a pathway to energy independence has been the President's ambition to promote trade deals that are free and fair. And we've opened up new markets. Just about two weeks ago, we signed a new trade deal with Japan where we're going to , we're going to export more agricultural goods to Japan than ever before. We've opened up markets in South America. We renegotiated the South Korea trade agreement. But sitting on the desk of the Speaker of the House in Washington, D.C., is the largest trade deal in American history. And I came here to Minnesota today to say the time has come for Democrats in Congress to pass the USMCA, and pass it this year. (Applause.) I mean, I don't have to tell all of you that trade means jobs here in Minnesota. In fact, we got someone with us today who, during his time in Congress, was a great, great champion of economic growth and low taxes, and free and fair trade. Jason Lewis, thank you so much for being with us today , you and your wonderful wife, Leigh. (Applause.) But I want to challenge each one of you because we've got a great opportunity in front of us. And Washington, D.C. is spending its time on the endless investigations and controversy. But we got an opportunity to pass something in the Congress that would be a win for everyone in Minnesota and a win for this country, and that's the USMCA. Did you know that Minnesota actually sends $7.2 billion of exports to Canada and Mexico every single year? And we know that's only going to grow in this North Central State here in the Heartland of the country once the USMCA is signed into law. It will be the largest trade deal in the history of this country, but the Congress has to pass it. But we're confident that if Speaker Pelosi will put it on the floor, it's going to pass. And it'll pass the Senate, and President Trump will sign it into law. So I want you to let your voice be heard. Let all the people representing Minnesota in Washington, D.C. know that the folks here at Safety Signs know that a growing economy relies on trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And while you're at it, give Congresswoman Angie Craig a call and tell her you want the USMCA voted on the floor of the House and you wanted voted this year. Give her a call and let her know. And tell her I told you. (Applause.) All right? I mean, tell Congresswoman Angie Craig, ""Let's put politics aside."" And tell Speaker Pelosi to bring that trade deal to the floor and deliver a real win for all the people of Minnesota and all the people of America. But listen, let me thank you all. Thank you all for taking time. Again, I want to express my appreciation to Sue and Jay Blanchard for your example, for your hospitality, for being just great, great small-business owners here in Minnesota. We're really proud to be with you today. And I want to congratulate again each and every one of you for making , making a business like this have such a great impact on this community, and, frankly, on the life of this state and this nation. And I want to promise you , I want to promise you: On behalf of my friend who's going to be landing not too long in the Twin Cities in that big blue and white plane, and on behalf of the First Family, and on behalf of our family, we're never going to stop fighting for the , to keep the promises that we made the people of Minnesota. We're going to make America safer than ever before. We're going to make America and Minnesota more prosperous than ever before. And to borrow a phrase, we're going to keep America great. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless Minnesota. And God bless America. Thanks for the warm welcome. (Applause.)

VSMP2110201946	Mike Pence	2019-10-21	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2019 International Astronautical Congress Opening Ceremony	speech	"10:41 A.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you, Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Thank you for those kind words. But more importantly, would you all join me in thanking the great administrator of NASA for the work he is doing to revive American leadership in space? (Applause.) And to all the extraordinary leaders and innovators gathered here from all across America and all around the world , men and women who are share , who share our vision for human exploration, for American and worldwide innovation, carrying us back to the vast expanse of space: It is my great honor to welcome all of you to this incredible gathering, celebrating the power of the past and the promise of the future, the Opening Ceremony of the 70th International Astronautical Congress. Welcome to Washington, D.C. (Applause.) And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to renewing American leadership here on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space and who has brought a renewed vigor and vision to America's space enterprise. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, the United States has always been a nation of restless pioneers, ever striving to explore uncharted lands, reach new horizons, and venture into the unknown, including efforts to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. And earlier this year, the world paid tribute to three great Americans and to the 400,000 men and women who made their journey possible 50 years ago this year, when those three Americans and all who support them undertook ""the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind [had] ever embarked."" They turned ""one small step for man"" into ""one giant leap for mankind."" And today, you'll help celebrate that. So would you join me in congratulating the 2019 World Space Award winners, the crew of Apollo 11? (Applause.) Including the incomparable Buzz Aldrin, who is with us here today , (applause) , the grandson of Michael Collins, and the son of Commander Neil Armstrong, Mark Armstrong. Let's hear it, everybody. (Applause.) It's an honor to be with all of you and to remember the extraordinary contributions that you, Buzz, and your family members made to mankind 50 years ago. And as I stand before you today, as we remember the past, I'm proud to report that the United States of America is renewing the legacy of those courageous space pioneers and all they represent. Because under President Donald Trump's leadership, America is leading in space once again. (Applause.) In our first year in office, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, President Trump revived the National Space Council to coordinate space activities across the whole of government. And it is, as Jim Bridenstine said, my great honor to serve as chairman of the National Space Council, as other Vice Presidents have done before me. At President Trump's direction, we've renewed America's commitment to human space exploration, vowing to go further into space than ever before. In our first year in office, the President signed what came to be known as Space Policy Directive-1, making the national policy of the United States of America to return to the Moon and prioritize crewed missions to the lunar surface. And earlier this year, President Trump made it the policy of this administration to return to the Moon by 2024, ensuring that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will both be American astronauts. (Applause.) In fact, as you just heard, NASA made history this past week when it successfully performed the first unmanned spacewalk , the first all-woman spacewalk as [in] history. So join me in congratulating American astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch for their historic accomplishments, past, present, and future. (Applause.) As President Trump has said, we will return American astronauts to the Moon ""for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use."" And not only to ""plant our flag and leave our footprint,"" but to ""establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars."" With Apollo in the history books, the Artemis mission has begun, and we are well on our way to making NASA's Moon-to-Mars Mission a reality. In order for us to take this next big leap, we'll develop the technologies to live on the Moon for months and even years. We'll learn how to make use of resources that the Moon has to offer. That includes mining oxygen from the lunar surface and rocks to fuel reusable landers, extracting water from the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole, and developing a new generation of nuclear-powered spacecraft that will help us fly further and farther and faster than ever before. So we're going back to the Moon and then to Mars. And we're taking steps to ensure that the American space industry is up to the task as well. Working with partners from our Users' Advisory Group, we promulgated a long range of reforms to invigorate the commercial space sector across this country and across the world. In fact, I know that many members of the Users' Advisory Group , leaders in industry that are giving counsel to our nation's space efforts , are with us today. Would the members of the Users' Advisory Group please stand and allow all of these colleagues to show their appreciation to each and every one of you. (Applause.) Thank you all. I want thank Admiral Jim Ellis and all the distinguished members of the National Space Council's Users' Advisory Group. And working with each and one of them, and in close cooperation with our allies around the world, including many of the nations represented here, we've encouraged a more stable space environment by developing the word's first comprehensive Space Traffic Management Policy. And the guidance of our Users' Advisory Group assisted with that. Our administration is committed to ensuring that the United States also leverages the power of private enterprise in space. And even now, NASA is leading a commercial-friendly effort to develop the orbital platforms that will one day replace the International Space Station, as well as the human lunar landers that will carry us back to the Moon. Today, thanks to the leadership that President Trump has provided, the United States of America is open for business to all space enterprises. (Applause.) As we've built up confidence in the opportunities that space can provide, we've unleashed the American space industry as never before. Evidence of that: In August, SpaceX carried more than 3,300 pounds of samples and cargo down to Earth at the conclusion of its 18th commercial resupply mission for the International Space Station. Two weeks ago, Northrop Grumman made history when it launched the first-ever commercial satellite-servicing spacecraft to not only extend the lifespan of several satellites, but also pave the way for in-space manufacturing. And just last week, LeoLabs announced the operation of its advanced Kiwi Space Radar, which has the capability to track debris in space as small as two centimeters and will help protect billions of dollars in spacecraft and satellites from colliding with dangerous objects in orbit. And space companies have driven incredible economic growth across the globe. I know that's well understood in this room and by all that are looking on. In the first half of this year, we've seen almost as much invested in space companies as we did in the entire year before. In fact, in the last decade, nearly $25 billion has been invested in nearly 500 different space companies, and I'm proud to say that the majority of those investments have been directed to American businesses. Our continued success in space will require a close cooperation of all of us across governments, universities, and the commercial space industry, which is what makes this 70th International Astronautical Congress so important. The good news is that, with the renewed American leadership in space, we're also seeing renewed cooperation among freedom-loving nations around the world to advance space exploration. Already, as I stand here today, 18 of the nations represented here have proven their ability to work together through the 19-year mission of the International Space Station. And just last month, Australia announced a historic $150 million investment in the burgeoning space industry in their country, including through support of NASA's Artemis lunar program and our future mission to Mars. Canada has already agreed to support development of the Lunar Gateway , a critical outpost and refueling station that'll help us develop technologies, test the systems, and train the astronauts for the first-ever crewed mission to Mars. And just last week, Prime Minister Abe announced Japan's intention to join our efforts, both in the Lunar Gateway and on the lunar surface. Japan has been a vital partner of the International Space Station, in our mutual defense and in countless other endeavors. And so we are grateful for this most recent sign of Japan's enduring commitment to a partnership and for their support of our Moon-to-Mars Mission. And as I stand before you today, even now I know that our friends and allies in Europe are holding active discussions about involvement in our space exploration missions. So on behalf of the United States of America, let me say to all of our allies and partners in space: Thank you for working with us to advance human understanding in space. We will do it together. (Applause.) You know, when President Trump revived the National Space Council, he said that he believed, as I do, that, ""It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown."" And American history has proven that out. But to be clear, our vision is to be the leader amongst freedom-loving nations on the adventure into the great unknown. And here at this International Astronautical Congress, let me say: The United States of America will always be willing to work closely with like-minded, freedom-loving nations, as we lead mankind into the final frontier. (Applause.) As more nations gain the ability to explore space and develop places beyond Earth's atmosphere, we must also ensure , we must also ensure that we carry into space our shared commitment for freedom and the rule of law and private property. The long-term exploration and development of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies will require the use of resources found in outer space, including water and minerals. And so we must encourage the responsible commercial use of these resources, which is why the United States will continue to honor international law and existing space agreements that protect private property, while pursuing new policies that build trust with our allies, our commercial partners, and other spacefaring nations. We will use all available legal and diplomatic means to create a stable and orderly space environment that drives opportunity, creates prosperity, and ensures our security on Earth and in the vast expanse of space. (Applause.) Space plays a critical role in our national security as it does for every nation around the world. And, to that end, President Trump has directed our administration to work with bipartisan leadership in Congress. And soon, we will stand up the sixth branch of our Armed Forces: the United States Space Force. Soon, it will be a reality and the Space Force will be a vanguard to defending our nation, defending our freedom, and defending the rights of all freedom-loving nations in the vast expanses of space. So it's an honor to be with all of you today, to be able to update you briefly on the progress that we're making. And I know this is going to be a momentous week as you gather here at this important international conference. I hope you will leave America's capital with confidence that America is leading in space again, and that we are determined to lead , be the leader amongst freedom-loving nations into the vast expanse of space. We're opening the doors for private space enterprise to develop the means and technology for low-Earth orbit. And with the President's vision for NASA's renewed Moon-to-Mars Mission, I truly believe that, working with so many of the nations gathered here, we will once again inspire the world by the heights we reach and the history we make. So thank you for the opportunity of addressing each one of you today. You know, it is said , it is said, without a vision, that people perish. And I would offer today that so, too, do great endeavors. The truth is, for more than a generation, a vision for human space exploration had languished in this country and around the world. But those days are over. With America's renewed vision for human space exploration, we will lead mankind into the vast expanse of space. The task before us will involve hardship and hazard, sacrifice and determination. And it will require faith. Faith in the boundless capacity of American ingenuity and the ingenuity and cooperation of freedom-loving nations around the world. Faith in the extraordinary courage of the men and women who, even now, train and prepare to move the boundary lines of human knowledge. And faith, as generations of Americans have long believed, that even if we rise on the wings of the dawn, even if we go up to the heavens, even there, His hand will guide us and His right hand will hold us fast. So thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today and helping you begin what I know will be an important week in the space enterprise in our nation around the world. And I'm confident that with the leadership of President Donald Trump, with the courage of a new generation of explorers, with the strong support and cooperation of our private partners, and with the strong cooperation of all of our freedom-loving international allies, and with God's help, we will lead the world into the vast expanse of space once again for the benefit of all mankind. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations represented here. And God bless America. (Applause.) END 10:59 A.M.

VSMP2110201947	Mike Pence	2019-10-21	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement | Duryea, PA	speech	"5:27 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Pennsylvania! (Applause.) To Secretary Wilbur Ross, Congressman Dan Meuser, Congressman Fred Keller, and my friend, Jay Timmons, and above all, to Jim and Rob and all of the incredible men and women of SCHOTT North America: It is great to be back in the Keystone State. Thank you so much for that warm welcome. (Applause.) And before we get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine , a man who loves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and who's been fighting every day for the last three years for manufacturing in this state and all across this country. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And thanks for that great warm welcome. It really is great to be here , be here with all of you, and also with a company that's really creating opportunities, not only in this community, but literally all across America. It is remarkable to think that, 50 years ago, SCHOTT opened its first optics location in the United States of America, right here in Pennsylvania. Fifty years ago, this year. (Applause.) Now they have facilities all across the country, but this is where it all started. And this is where the confidence of this company grew in the hardworking people of this country. Since then, this facility, I'm told, has expanded nearly five times over. You've created more than 200 high-skilled jobs. And that's in addition to more than 1,000 other jobs that SCHOTT has created across America. So let's hear it for a great American success story: SCHOTT North America. (Applause.) And I had a chance to meet a number of members of your team that all ended up in the balcony. (Laughter.) Give them a round of applause. This is a great group of people. (Applause.) Thank you so much. As I told them , as I told them, this is a great company. It's a great corporate citizen , the second largest employer in this community. But there's also something very special about this place , because from day one, 50 years ago, this company, this facility has provided the support and the equipment to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. And you have done it with great professionalism. (Applause.) In fact, I expect there's more than a few veterans, men and women who served in the armed forces who are here with us today, members of this team and in this community. If you served in our armed forces, if you're able, would you mind standing up? Just stand up and let us say thank you one more time. (Applause.) Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. Thank you. I mean, it's amazing when you think about what this company has been providing to our warfighters around the world. You make those rifle sites that make it possible for our team to accomplish their mission in the field. You make glass for the Bradley tanks, the Apache helicopters, as well as parts for night vision goggles and for mission [missile] guidance systems. And it's amazing to think about the difference that what you do here, what you create here, has made in securing this nation and providing for our national defense. So give yourselves another round of applause for 50 years of making our warfighters and making America safer. (Applause.) Great job. And also, you know, I started today at a big international conference on space. And I'm proud to report to you, under President Trump's leadership, America is leading in space once again. We're going back to the Moon and then to Mars. (Applause.) And I got a feeling SCHOTT is going with us. (Laughter and applause.) Am I right? It's true. It's true. I don't know if you knew this, Wilbur, but products made right at this facility have supported America's space program from the very beginning. Your products aren't just used around the world, they're literally used across the solar system. (Laughter.) It's remarkable to think products here in this building have gone from Pennsylvania to the Moon, and even to the outer reaches of this solar system. But I was pleased to bring with me today, also, a letter of congratulations from that friend that I mentioned. Fifty years of contributing to our national defense. Fifty years of committing to the American space program. I am honored today to deliver a letter congratulating SCHOTT North America from the President of the United States. Congratulations to this great team and this great company. (Applause.) And I'm glad to hear this success , 50 years , is just what you all here at SCHOTT call a good start, right? (Laughter.) I mean, the truth is , the truth is this company is thriving. And under President Trump's leadership, America is thriving, our economy is booming. I mean, over the last three years, this company alone has invested another $32 million just in this facility, expanded the workforce here by 15 percent, and seen sales go up by a third. And if there are any jobseekers out there across Pennsylvania, I just heard, walking in here, SCHOTT is hiring if you're looking for a job. Give them a call. (Applause.) Not that that's any real surprise. Did you know that there's more job openings today across this country than there are men and women looking for work in the United States? And I'm here today to celebrate the success of this company, but also , also to say thank you to each and every one of you for contributing so much to Pennsylvania and so much to the life of this nation. But I'm also here on the President's behalf because we've got a great opportunity. You've heard about it from this podium before, and I mean to talk about it. But before I do that, I want to talk about the progress that we've made because of the confidence the people of Pennsylvania placed in this President back in 2016. You know, when I think of the last three years, I think there's only one way you can describe it. It's been three years of action, three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept! But we're just getting started, Pennsylvania! (Applause.) I mean, seriously, the growth in this company, the growth that we see all across America is a result of the leadership that President Trump and our allies in Congress have been delivering since day one of this administration. I mean, the President went right to work, from early on. The day after inauguration, we , we went to work to keep those promises. This President actually signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. President Trump has already signed more laws repealing federal red tape than any President in the history of this country, and we've unleashed American energy. (Applause.) Incredible. Did you know, next year, America will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years? We're on the road to energy independence. (Applause.) And in the midst of all of that tax relief, rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, this President has also been fighting every day. He's been fighting every day for trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal, and trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. The results have really been remarkable. Since Election Day, businesses just like this one, all across the country, have literally created 6.5 million new jobs. That includes more than 140,000 jobs right here in Pennsylvania. (Applause.) Isn't that something? The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and the unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded. The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) And you know what? It's not just been more jobs, but it's been better jobs and better pay. Since President Trump was elected, the average American household has seen your disposable income go up, on average, by $5,000 a year. And maybe most important to the President and me is that wages are rising. Wages are rising today at the fastest pace that they've risen in more than 10 years. Maybe most encouraging of all, wages are rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) It's true. And since President Trump's election, we've seen a real renaissance in manufacturing. I mean, it really is pretty incredible. I mean, you remember the last administration? The President, in the summer of 2016, actually said that 200,000 manufacturing jobs that they'd lost over their eight years in the White House were never coming back. I remember when President Obama said, ""What do you , you have a magic wand you're going to wave to bring those jobs back?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in the last three years. (Applause.)Incredible. Including nearly 2,000 manufacturing jobs just in this state alone. And results like this don't just happen. The truth is, all of this happens because of the policies that this President and our allies in the Congress have supported every step of the way. But they also have happened , they've also happened mostly because, quite frankly, working Americans are the best workers in the world. (Applause.) All of you are driving the boom in this company, in this state, and in this country. (Applause.) It's true. People, like a guy I heard about on the way here, who grew up next door in Pittston and who started with SCHOTT immediately after graduating from high school. I'm told he's actually here with us, with his wife today, who also worked at this facility for 21 years. Today he's a part of the glass fabrication team. And I'm actually told , I had to ask twice , but he's actually celebrating 48 years of service to this company. (Applause.) Would you please join me in thanking Stanley Budzilek? Stanley. Give it up. (Applause.) Give Stanley and his wife a standing ovation, will you? I mean, that's an incredible commitment to a great company. Wow. Thanks, Stanley. Thanks, Debbie. Wow. That's incredible. I'm also told, in addition to these incredible employees that really represent all of you in this great company, we actually have with us more than 100 employees from another great Pennsylvania manufacturer that's located right across the street. It's a company that makes electric wheelchairs that are used all across America and provide important service and transportation to Americans (inaudible) of need. Just like SCHOTT, this company is growing, I'm told, hiring even more Pennsylvanians as we speak. It's led by the family of none other than my friend, Congressman Dan Meuser. So let's give a warm welcome to the workers from Pride Mobility Solutions. (Applause.) To a great family and a great company. Thanks, Dan. (Applause.) To all of those team members, to Stanley and Debbie, and, really, all of you: I just want to , I just want to thank you for what you're doing, seizing on the opportunity to grow this company and grow this state and grow this nation. I mean, each one of you are proving every single day that as long as the playing field is level, American workers can out-compete, out-innovate, and out-work anybody in the world. And you're doing it every day. (Applause.) You are. And that's why from the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to open up markets all over the world. The President renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea. He signed two new trade agreements with Japan just in the last couple of weeks. Negotiations with China are ongoing , you see it all in the paper , but President Donald Trump has put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over. (Applause.) We're going to stand up for American jobs and American property in our relations with China. But closer to home, what brings me here today is that this President, now more than a year ago, negotiated the largest trade deal in American history. We call it the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA. And I was there for a lot of the discussions and a lot of the negotiations. And I'm here to tell you, the man who wrote ""The Art of the Deal"" drove a hard bargain. He put American jobs and American workers and American agriculture first. And the truth is, as I stand here today, the USMCA is languishing in the House of Representatives, isn't it, guys? I mean, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring the USMCA to the floor. You see the headlines. These days, Democrats are spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment, but the American people deserve better. (Applause.) And I came to Pennsylvania to say it's time for the Democrats in Congress to put Pennsylvania first. It's time to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) True. And I came here to tell all of you that it's , the time has come for Congressman Matt Cartwright to tell his leadership in the Congress that Pennsylvania needs the USMCA and we need it this year. (Applause.) You know, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add more than $68 billion to our economy, right out of the gate. And they project it's going to create another 175,000 jobs. That includes nearly 50,000 good manufacturing jobs. And again, we're not just talking about creating more jobs but better jobs. According to the same report, under the USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise in addition to the wage increases you've already seen under the policies advanced by this administration. I mean, Pennsylvanians today already export more than $15 billion of your goods and services to Canada and Mexico every year. And under the USMCA, as you already heard, that's only going to grow once we sign it into law. And it's going to create more jobs and more opportunities here in Pennsylvania. But, honestly, I can tell you, we got our work cut out for us, men and women. I mean, I just heard that former Vice President Biden is going to be in Scranton tomorrow. And before I got off the airplane, I heard he actually came out against the USMCA. I mean, Joe actually put out a statement saying that, quote, ""Pennsylvanians will not be fooled by Pence's blind promotion of Trump's irresponsible trade war[s]."" Well, Joe, Pennsylvanians will not be fooled. (Applause.) They know the USMCA is a win for Pennsylvania and a win for America. And it's time you got on board. I mean, the truth is, Pennsylvania lost 51,000 manufacturing jobs when Joe was Vice President. And the people of Pennsylvania know we can do better than NAFTA. They know they deserve better than NAFTA. So, anyway, if you bump into a familiar face over the next couple of days, tell Joe that Pennsylvania and America need the USMCA and we need it this year. (Applause.) But as I said, it's going to take all of us to get it done. It really is. So I came up to Pennsylvania to tell you to turn up the heat, Pennsylvania. Turn up the heat on Congressman Matt Cartwright. Turn up the heat on the Democrats in Congress. Send a message from the Keystone State that we want to put our jobs and our future first. (Applause.) I mean, the clock is ticking, so I want you to reach out. Reach out to all of our elected officials in Washington, D.C. I mean, tell them , say, ""You know, I ran into Mike the other day"" , (laughter) , ""and he seemed very excited about this USMCA. He told us what it's going to mean for manufacturing, what it's going to mean for this economy."" And just tell them how important it is. Set politics aside and do what's right for Pennsylvania and do what's right for America. So call your elected officials. But let me save you a nickel. You don't need to call Congressman Dan Meuser or Congressman Fred Keller because they're leading the charge for the USMCA in Washington. (Applause.) Great job. But I'll be honest with you, the Democrats representing Pennsylvania in Washington, D.C., could use to hear from you. And tell them to tell Speaker Pelosi to take that trade deal that's been on her desk for a year and put it on the floor. I mean, we really believe that if Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Matt Cartwright put the USMCA on the floor, it's going to pass, and it's going to pass on a bipartisan basis , it truthfully is , because it's going to be good for every American. And while you're at it, after you get done calling those members of the House, you can call Senator Bob Casey and call Senator Pat Toomey, and tell them the USMCA is a win for Pennsylvania, and you're counting on their support. (Applause.) And tell them all , tell them all how this agreement is going to create more jobs, more manufacturing jobs. It's going to increase wages all across Pennsylvania and all across America. So, thanks for , thanks for hearing me out on that. I've been traveling all over the country talking about the USMCA. I've been traveling with the Secretary of Commerce, visiting manufacturing sites , I'll be in Wisconsin a little bit later this week , just because I know that, for all the progress that we've made in this economy, that's just what this businessman-turned-President calls a ""good start."" You know, one of the most amusing things that I ever hear when I'm traveling around the country , and I heard it today at the airport when I landed , is they say, ""Tell the President to just keep going."" (Applause.) You know? But let me tell you, Pennsylvania, that's something you never have to tell President Donald Trump. All the reverse is stripped out of that pick-up truck. It just goes forward. And we're going to keep fighting for jobs in Pennsylvania and America. (Applause.) I'm telling you. But thanks for coming out today. And I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits before I'm headed out. And in the days and weeks ahead, I'll make you a promise: Whatever Democrats in Washington, D.C., want to spend their time doing, President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting to keep the promises that we made to the people of Pennsylvania. We're never going to stop working to grow this economy and make America more safe, more prosperous, and secure. We're never going to stop delivering on that agenda of a strong national defense, secure borders, conservatives on our courts at every level, and jobs, jobs, jobs. (Applause.) So we're going to keep going forward, and we're going to keep fighting. And I have to , I have to believe, the confidence of people of Pennsylvania , the confidence of people of Pennsylvania who carried us in 2016 is carrying us to this day. Because the truth is, I have , I have faith. I have faith in this President that Pennsylvania said yes to , that, every single day, he's going to keep fighting to do all the things that have made this nation more secure and more prosperous. I have faith in all of you and the people of this country. When given the opportunity to expand and create growth, expand opportunities for yourselves and your families, make your communities more prosperous, the American people seize on that opportunity. And finally, in these too divided of times, I have that other kind of faith. You know, it seems like every time I turn on the television, people are talking about what divides the people of this country. But I'll always believe that there's always been more that unites us in these United States of America than will ever divide us. And chief among that is faith. And with faith in Him who planted this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores, I know the best days for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and America are yet to come. So let's go to work, Pennsylvania. Let's go to work with confidence and faith. Let's keep advancing the policies that will make this country safer and more prosperous than ever before. And with President Trump in the White House, with your continued support, with the USMCA signed into law, with strong support from our allies in Congress, and with God's help, we're going to make Pennsylvania safer than ever before. We're going to make Pennsylvania and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine. And to borrow a phrase, we're going to keep making America great again. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. God bless Pennsylvania. And God bless America. (Applause.) END 5:53 P.M.

VSMP2310201945	Mike Pence	2019-10-23	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Heritage Foundation Honors Gala	speech	"7:30 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Heritage Foundation! (Applause.) It's a great honor to be with you all tonight for this very special evening. And I know you just gave her a rousing round of applause, but would you join me in thanking Kay Coles James one more time for the extraordinary leadership that she has provided for this incomparable institution? (Applause.) And to some great friends, great members of our administration who are with us tonight , the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, is with us. (Applause.) Where are you, Betsy? (Applause.) A great champion of jobs and opportunities and expanded trade all across North America , I was on the road with him this week , thank Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Where are you, Wilbur? Thank you so much. (Applause.) To the members of Congress, to ambassadors, distinguished guests, my fellow conservatives: It is an honor to be with you tonight. All of you gathering from near and far at the first-ever Heritage Foundation Honors Gala, thank you for being here. (Applause.) As I glance across the room, I see so many friends, so many fellow travelers who have been there all along the way as my wife and I have journeyed as a part of this movement, and it's a joy to be with you this evening. It really is. But before I get started, let me bring greetings from another friend of mine. (Laughter.) I just left his office and told him I was coming to speak to the Heritage Foundation's wonderful gathering of great conservatives from all across America, and I think he looked just a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings from a champion of a stronger and more prosperous America, and someone who has advanced the cause that Heritage Foundation has been advancing for 50 years , the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Thank you. So thank you for that. And I truly do believe that, thanks to your support and to the vision and the ideals that Heritage Foundation has advanced over the last 50 years, we're making America great again. And we have so many of you in Heritage Foundation to thank. Just as Heritage armed another President with this 1,100-page policy blueprint to advance conservative principles 39 years ago, Heritage Foundation has been fighting side-by-side with this President and this administration since day one, and we have a stronger an America as a result. (Applause.) I mean, from right in the transition, we went to work availing ourselves of the resources available from the Heritage Foundation. We laid out plans for this administration. We drew on the scholarship and the resources of this historic think tank. And let me take a moment to thank a man who was indispensable throughout that process, and, frankly, has been the indispensable man of the Heritage Foundation throughout all of the decades. He has influenced generations of young conservatives, he co-founded this organization, and I'm told that he is this year's recipient of the Clare Boothe Luce Award. Would you join me in thanking my friend, Dr. Ed Feulner, for all he has done for the cause and the country? (Applause.) I mean, with the support of all of you, we've been able to bring about historic change in this country. I mean, it's amazing. When you think about the last three years, I think there's only one way you can describe it. It's been three years of action. It's been three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Heritage Foundation. (Applause.) And this President , this President knows, as I do, that the first obligation of our national government is to provide for the common defense. And I can tell you, President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people. You know, when Heritage Foundation was established, I know, personally, that it was established as a defense think tank that came together at a time that, as in recent years, America was neglecting our first obligation. And I'll tell you, I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces. With the support of Heritage Foundation and your guidance, we've rebuilt our military; we've restored the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) I mean, this President has actually signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) I mean, we're finally again giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard, and their families the resources, the technology, and the support they need to accomplish their mission and defend our nation. I know there's many men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States who are with us here today. In fact, if you're a veteran of our armed forces, would you all just mind standing up for a second and letting us thank you one more time for your service to this nation? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. This nation will always be grateful. But let me just take a moment to thank one who is among us in particular: a special American. Tonight, we have with us a man who saved the life of one of his fellow Marines in Afghanistan. He did that at great risk of his life. It was a day in November of 2010. History records that insurgents threw a hand grenade inside their patrol base, and, without hesitation, this American dove on that grenade. After the blast, as he lay there, he asked if his fellow Marine was okay, and then made his peace with God. He would lose consciousness for five weeks. And while he was being treated, he actually went into cardiac arrest three times. When his mother first saw him, out at Walter Reed Hospital, she didn't even recognize him. And to this day, he has undergone more than 70 procedures during 40 separate surgeries. But he hasn't let that slow him down or steal his patriotic fervor for this nation. He is now an author, a marathon runner, and testament to a strong faith in God. And he is now an inspiration to millions. Would you join me in showing our admiration and appreciation to Medal of Honor recipient, Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter? (Applause.) Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, Kyle. You know, in this administration, we've been standing with our armed forces and with the families who wait for them back home, ensuring they can make the transition back to civilian life as well. From the first days of this administration, this President has also been working to revive the American economy, taking the very principles at the heart of the Heritage Foundation and putting them into practice. I mean, from early in this administration, President Trump rolled his sleeves up. We worked with our allies in Congress, who are all so well represented here. And with their help, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. (Applause.) The largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. This President has also signed more bills cutting red tape than any President in history. And we've unleashed American energy; an American energy renaissance is on. (Applause.) And we've been fighting for free and fair and reciprocal trade around the world , opening up markets across this hemisphere, negotiated a new trade agreement with South Korea. And it's been a year in waiting on Nancy Pelosi's desk , (laughter) , but the USMCA is a win for American jobs, a win for American farmers, and it's time the Democrats in Congress passed it on the floor. (Applause.) So it's been about all of things the Heritage Foundation has always advocated , less taxes, less red tape, more American energy, and free and fair trade, and open markets. And the results have frankly been amazing, not that that should be a surprise to anybody in the Heritage Foundation. Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small have created 6.5 million new jobs and the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. (Applause.) I don't have to tell all of you that freedom works. It's something Heritage Foundation has known for a long time. And more economic freedom in this country has resulted in more Americans working today than ever before in the history of this country. The unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded in the history of this country. The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) The unemployment rate for women is at a 65-year low. And American is prospering as never before. And with that renewed American strength, we're also seeing wages rise. It really is remarkable that over the course of , over the course of the last 10 years, it's been wages for working Americans that have struggled the most. I remember when I was governor of the state of Indiana, we had , we had watched the economy struggle to increase wages for working Americans. So I've got to tell you: President Trump and I couldn't be more proud. By putting all of these commonsense, conservative principles into practice, today wages are rising at the fastest rate that they've risen in the last 10 years and they're rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) So America is strong again. America's military , the strongest military in the history of the world , is stronger still. And our economy is stronger than ever before. And with that renewed American strength, I'm proud to report that the United States is once again embracing our role as leader of the free world. After years of broken promises and apologies from other Presidents, times are different now. America is standing with our allies and we're standing up to our enemies. We're standing with our allies like our most cherished ally. When after four previous administrations had promised they would, President Donald Trump did when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. (Applause.) This President has stood up for Israel's right to defend itself, recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and made that historic decision. And President Trump also has stood up to the world's leading state sponsor of terror when he withdrew the United States of America from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. (Applause.) I mean, let me make a promise to all of you tonight: There will be no more pallets of cash to the mullahs in Iran. (Applause.) I mean, how great is it to have a President who is standing up for America on the world stage and never apologizing for America on the world stage? (Applause.) In fact, in that strong stand, I'm pleased to report our allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before. And with that renewed strength, the President has taken the fight to our enemies on our terms, on their soil. And earlier this year, under the leadership of this Commander-in-Chief and the strength of our armed forces and our allies in the region, we captured the last inch of territory controlled by the ISIS caliphate. (Applause.) And America will always be grateful for our Kurdish allies and the Syrian Defense Forces who fought shoulder-to-shoulder and bravely with us in this fight. And now that our military and our allies have achieved our objectives against ISIS, President Trump is keeping his word to the American people, and our troops are starting to come home. Kurdish Syrian Defense Forces were strong allies in the fight against ISIS, and we'll always be grateful. In the wake of Turkish forces invading Syria, President Trump imposed strong sanctions. He called on Turkey to stand down. And last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and I traveled to Turkey and secured a ceasefire agreement to allow our Kurdish allies in the Syrian Defense Forces to safely withdraw from the areas under Turkish military control. And over the past five days, our temporary ceasefire has held. (Applause.) Earlier today, we received word from the Syrian Defense Forces commander that all of their military forces had withdrawn from the safe zone of , under Turkish military control. And before I came here, our team was continuing in communications with both sides in the hope that a permanent ceasefire could soon take hold. And those discussions are ongoing. But, truthfully, as I stand before you today, I can report to you that, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, we have an opportunity for a permanent ceasefire. We may well give the international community an opportunity to establish a safe zone between Turkey and the Kurdish population in Syria that will ensure peace and security for all the peoples of this war-torn region. And in the midst of all of it, our troops are coming home. That is our aim, and that is our prayer. (Applause.) So we've advanced our national security on the world stage, but this President knows that national security includes border security. And I'm proud to report that, under this administration, we've made historic investments in border security, Mexico is doing more than ever before to secure our southern border and theirs, and we've already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) Once again, the results have been remarkable. As I stand before you today, after a crisis on , engulfed our border in the first four months of this year, apprehensions on our southern border in the last few months are already down by more than 60 percent. And with the strong counsel of scholars here at the Heritage Foundation, we'll continue. We'll continue to live out that principle that a nation without borders is not a nation. We will secure our borders and we will fix this broken immigration system once and for all. (Applause.) So it's been about security, it's been about prosperity, but it's also been about the rule of law. And as I stand before you today, I couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a President who has kept his word. And as I stand here, with the strong support of our Republican majority in the United States Senate, we've confirmed more than 150 principled, conservatives to our federal courts at every level. (Applause.) And they're all , they're all men and women of integrity who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, our Bill of Rights , like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) And this President has stood strong for our nominees. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of the United States Senate who are with us tonight and Senator Mitch McConnell for standing with at well , as well. It was about a year ago that we all saw the radical left try to slander the good name of a good man and a respected jurist. But President Trump and our Republicans in the Senate stood strong, and now Justice Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. (Applause.) As he promised in the campaign, this President has appointed judges who will stand firm on our Constitution as written. And that includes , we'll defend our first freedom, and this administration will always defend the freedom of religion of every American, of every faith, so help us God. (Applause.) From early on, with the steady counsel of Heritage Foundation, we've restored federal enforcement of our nation's conscience laws. We ended the last administration's assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor. (Applause.) And under the last administration , you might not have heard about this, but VA hospitals around the country were actually removing Bibles and even banning Christmas carols over the holidays in the hallways of those hospitals. I can't even imagine it. But after we took office, we , we , this administration went to court to stop activists from removing a Bible that was carried in World War II and displayed on a Missing Man Table in a VA hospital in New Hampshire. I promise you, this administration will always protect the right of our veterans to practice their faith, and follow our conscience. And our message to the VA hospital in New Hampshire was simple: The Bible stays. (Applause.) And finally, you know, I've long believed that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable. And Heritage Foundation has always stood for that principle as well. And the way a society deals with the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn speaks to the heart of the nation. And at a time when leading Democrats are advocating late-term abortion and defending infanticide, I couldn't be more proud to serve as Vice President to the most pro-life President in American history. (Applause.) It's true. It's true. In one of his very first acts as President, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy to make sure taxpayer dollars wouldn't be used to promote or provide abortion overseas. And I'll never forget the day. It was , Kay, it was very early in the administration. The March for Life had come around, but the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was going to be in town that day. And I was standing in the Oval Office in January of 2017, and they were discussing the President's schedule and how it wouldn't be possible for him to participate with a foreign head of state in town. And I remember I stood there kind of shyly as they discussed his invitation to address the crowd. And I looked at him and said, ""Um, well, you know, um , they invited me, too."" (Laughter.) And the President looked up from the Resolute Desk and said, ""They invited you?"" And I said, ""Yeah."" And he said, ""You mean, to speak?"" And I said, ""Yes, I "" And he said, ""I mean, you want to do it?"" And I said, ""Well, we've , we've gone to a lot of Marches for Life. We took our kids there when they were little. And I , it'd be my great honor."" And he said, ""Oh, well, you've got to do it."" (Laughter.) And I became the first Vice President in history to address the March for Life on the National Mall. And the next year, President Trump addressed them from the Rose Garden. (Applause.) It's true. That's not all of it. You know, I , (laughter) , as the Vice President, I had the privilege of casting tie-breaking votes in the United States Senate. And I've cast , I think, Pat, I've cast about 14 of them, back when the numbers were a little tighter. But I was never more proud than when I had the opportunity to cast the tie-breaking vote that allowed states to defund Planned Parenthood and President Donald Trump signed it into law. (Applause.) In fact , in fact, in August, it was announced, because of the President's strong pro-life policies, Planned Parenthood is no longer going to receive tens of millions of dollars under Title X altogether. And I promise you , (applause). I promise all of you , Heritage Foundation is about many things, but Heritage Foundation is about life. And I'll promise you, this President, this Vice President, this party, and this movement will always stand for the unalienable right to life. (Applause.) And as the President said well in his State of the Union Address, ""All children , all children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image of God."" You know, and just last month, President Trump made a stand for life at the United Nations General Assembly , which he said, on the world stage, in his words, that ""Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life."" So we've stood strong , (applause). We've stood strong for life and liberty, just like Heritage Foundation has done since its very founding, and America is winning again. America is safer. America is more prosperous. But make no mistake about it: With a little bit more than a year away from Election Day, the other side is motivated. They want nothing more than to undo all of the progress that we have made. All that we've achieved, and so much more, could be lost in one bad night next November. But I know Heritage Foundation is going to be there, telling the story about the cause of freedom, telling liberty's story, advancing those commonsense, conservative principles that this , this extraordinary vanguard has done throughout its life. And so many of you have made that possible I mean, the truth is, you look at their agenda and look at our agenda. It's just almost like mirror opposite. I was watching one of those debates the other night. (Laughter.) I didn't really want to. It's like, I figure there's a vice presidential nominee in there somewhere. (Laughter.) I mean, those people were standing so far on the left side of that stage, I thought it was going to tip over. (Laughter and applause.) I mean, seriously. I mean, you think about it. I mean, look at their , just look at their agenda. Where we passed the largest tax cuts in American history, they're talking about imposing the largest tax increases in the history of this country. Where we've rolled back burdensome regulations at a record level, they want to bury our economy in an avalanche of red tape, under the guise of Green New Deal and Medicare for All. Where we've advanced the cause of life and liberty for every American, they want taxpayer-funded abortion on demand. Today's Democratic Party has embraced a radical, far-left agenda on issues across the board. And it's even more remarkable today , more remarkable to me, as someone who's spent 60 times around the sun, growing up this nation, seeing all the great ideals of this country , that today, one of the two major parties in this country actually openly advocates an economic system that has impoverished millions and robbed the liberties of generations. And that system is socialism. Extraordinary. But everyone here involved in the Heritage Foundation knows even better than most: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the strongest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. It was freedom. (Applause.) It was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two world wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world. (Applause.) I say to my fellow conservatives: The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America. And so we must say, with one voice, for the next year, as President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union Address, ""America will never be a socialist country."" (Applause.) I think you all know the choice facing this country in the next year has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. We've made great progress in the last three years, but now it's time for us to continue to deliver and to defend the progress that we've made. I mean, we all know , you see the headlines. The Do-Nothing Democrats will stop at nothing to roll back the progress that we've made. They've spent the last three years on endless investigations trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election. But enough is enough. The American people have had enough of their endless investigations and partisan impeachment. The American people want progress in America, and that's what we've delivered and are going to keep delivering. (Applause.) But I'll make you a promise. I'll make you a promise that whatever the Democrats and their allies in the media want to spend their time on in the next year, President Donald Trump and I are going to keep , we're going to keep focused on the issues that Heritage Foundation has championed for generations , the issues that matter most to the American people: life, liberty, a strong national defense, secure borders, and jobs, jobs, jobs. (Applause.) So we've got our work cut out for us. As that first President who came to office with a Heritage Foundation's policy blueprint under his arm used to say, it's important to remember that ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" The truth is, men and women, it's not going to be enough for us just to win the next election. We've to win the next generation, and we've got to win the next generation for freedom. (Applause.) And so, in the face of the radical, left-wing agenda and their divisive politics, I just want to encourage Heritage Foundation. Keep educating. Keep communicating. Keep explaining to the American people what , what's at the heart of this extraordinary American experiment. I mean, the success that we have enjoyed in this nation, I will always believe, is a result of a few core principles that Heritage Foundation has always celebrated. The strength of this nation has always come from our faith in God and our freedom and our vast natural resources. And this administration will continue to celebrate all of that, advance all of that , even as we stand for a strong America on the world stage. We can do all this. We can do all this if Heritage continues to do its work educating people across this country and a rising generation of Americans in the days ahead. We can do this if we stand behind a President who's been delivering on the ideals and the values that Heritage has been championing now for generations. And not just stand with him for the next year, but we need to stand with President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. (Applause.) So keep believing, Heritage. Keep believing in this President, and in this team, and all of our allies in the Congress and at statehouses around the land that are standing unapologetically for that commonsense, conservative agenda. Keep believing in the American people. When the American people are given a choice between more freedom and more government, they choose more freedom every time. And keep , keep believing that this idea of freedom was not ours. You know, enshrined on the Liberty Bell are ancient words that make me think of the Heritage Foundation and its mission. Enshrined around the Liberty Bell there in Philadelphia are the words ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof."" It seems to me, as we gather at this gala tonight, that's what Heritage Foundation has always done. You've proclaimed liberty unto all of the land and all the inhabitants thereof. You strengthen the foundations of this nation because you know that, when we do freedom's work, we make His work on this Earth our own. So, Heritage Foundation , (applause) , keep telling freedom's story for strong national defense and a growing economy. Keep telling liberty's story. Keep believing in the American people. And I promise you, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with Republican leadership from our nation's capital to capitals around the land, and with God's help, we will keep America great. Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the Heritage Foundation. And God bless America. (Applause.) END 8:08 P.M.

VSMP2410201944	Mike Pence	2019-10-24	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement	speech	"2:58 P.M. CDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) It is great to be with all of you. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. To Congressman Brian Style , (applause) , to Congressman Glenn Grothman , (applause) , to my friend Kate O'Scannlain, to Linda McMahon, and the whole team at America First Policies who brought this all about, but most especially to Liz and Dick Uihlein and the incredible men and women of Uline: It is great to be in the Badger State. (Applause.) Thank you all for coming out today. Thank you for such a wonderful, warm welcome. It is great to be back in the Heartland. And before I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine. (Applause.) A man who loves the state of Wisconsin and has been fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the people of this state. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) But thank you all. Thank you again for the , thank for the time today and for making us so welcome. We have an important topic to discuss, and it's a real privilege to be here with more than 300 Wisconsinites and a great American company. It's amazing to think that the story of Uline is an inspiring story of the American Dream. It's remarkable to think that Liz and Dick started this now world-famous company in your basement. Nearly four decades later, Uline, I'm told, sells more than $2 billion in goods every year and has created more than 5,800 American jobs. (Applause.) Liz and Dick, would you just stand up and let us show how much we appreciate your leaderships, your vision, your character? These are two incredible Americans. (Applause.) And the story of Uline is a story of the American Dream. I was pleased to learn on the way here: Over the three years, Uline has grown even stronger. Sales, I'm told, are up by 44 percent, profits are up 58 percent, and Uline just created more than 1,200 new, good-paying American jobs. Uline is on a roll, Wisconsin is on a roll, and America is prospering because of all of you. (Applause.) But I'm here today because we've still got work to do, and we've got an incredible opportunity before us. Because sitting on the desk of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the largest trade deal in American history. And I came to Wisconsin to say it's time for Congress to enact the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year. (Applause.) But before I talk about that, let me take a minute just to reflect on the progress we've made because of the confidence that all of you and people of Wisconsin placed in this President and this administration. You know, when I think of the last three years, there's only one way that I can describe it. It's been three years of action. It's been three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Wisconsin. (Applause.) That's why we need the USMCA. I mean, think about it: I mean, President Trump promised to revive the American economy, and he went straight to work. Working with our allies in the Congress of the United States, President Trump signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. Disposable income for working families across this country is already up by more $5,000 a year. In fact, the President went on to sign more bills cutting federal red tape than any President in American history. And we've unleashed American energy. Next year, we will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. (Applause.) We're on the road to energy independence, Wisconsin. And evidence in the trade deal that brings us all here today, President Trump has been working hard for free, fair, and reciprocal trade that puts American jobs, in the city and on the farm, first. The results have really been remarkable in that agenda. I mean, since Election Day, businesses like this one , businesses large and small across America , have created 6.5 million new jobs in the last three years. (Applause.) And that includes more than 39,000 jobs right here in the Wisconsin. (Applause.) Amazing. The unemployment rate has hit a 50-year low. And here in Wisconsin, I'm told, it's even lower than the national average: it's 3.2 percent. In fact, right now, the unemployment rate is below 5 percent in 48 states and below 4 percent in 35 states. I mean, we're setting records all over. And even more important to the President and me is that, right now, we not only have the lowest levels of unemployment in more than half a century, but we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream is working again for every American. (Applause.) It's true. And, you know, it's not just more jobs , although there's a lot more jobs, right? It's been about better jobs. As I mentioned, since the President was elected, the average American household income has gone up by $5,000 a year. And that's being driven in large part by the fact that wages are rising. Wages are rising today at the fastest pace that they've risen in more than 10 years. And the President and I are probably most proud of the fact that wages, today, are rising most rapidly for hard-working, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) Now, this didn't just happen. All of this didn't just happen. It's not some economic cycle that's underway. It's because of the leadership and the policies that people of Wisconsin supported and the policies that this President was able to put in place because of the allies that we had in the Congress. And frankly , frankly, it's all happening because when the American people are given more economic freedom, allowed to keep more of what they earned; when we expand opportunities by rolling back red tape, we unleash American energy, and lower the cost of energy, lower the cost of energy in this country, the American people and American businesses know what to do, because the American worker is the best worker in the world. And that's why we're prospering , because Americans are seizing on it. It's true. (Applause.) I mean, it's really because of all of you, the President and I and our team and our allies in Congress have been working to enact the policies that give Americans the opportunity. But the growth that's happening is because, from the Uline family down to everybody wearing all these great red shirts and all of you here, businesses like this one across the country have bene seizing the opportunity. But it's people that are driving America's success. People like a man who I'm told served six years in the Illinois National Guard as a Chemical Operations Specialist. He served a tour of duty in Afghanistan as a truck commander on a ground assault convoy team. There, he came back with the Meritorious Service Award. But for the last five years, he's been using those skills he learned in the uniform of the United States to build this company. So would you join me in thanking Sergeant Jacob Kueker for his service to America and his incredible contributions to the success of Uline? (Applause.) Thank you, Jake. And thanks for your service. We also, I'm told, have with us today the leaders of a fourth-generation family business just nearby in Racine. For nearly 90 years, I'm told, their family has been making dependable tools. They've created hundreds of good manufacturing jobs here in Wisconsin. They're making a difference every single day in this growing Wisconsin economy. So would you join me in thanking the owners of A&E Incorporated, John and Julie Lang. Thank you for being with us today. (Applause.) Thanks for being part of a growing American economy. Congratulations. To Jacob, John, and Julie, I mentioned you not just to make you stand up in front of all your neighbors and friends, but really because you , you're all emblematic , you're emblematic of all the great people who are here today who are demonstrating each and every day that when the American people are able to keep more of what they earn; when businesses have less taxes, less regulation; and we clear the way with free and fair and reciprocal trade, American businesses and American workers can compete and win against any businesses in the world. So give yourselves a big round of applause, because that's what this company and all of you prove every day. (Applause.) It's true. And when that playing field is level, American workers can compete with anybody. That's why, since day one of this administration, this President and our entire team have been working to open up markets across the world. The President has been doing it on a very simple principle. He has a word that he really likes when it comes to trade; it's called ""reciprocal."" He really believes that people that have access to the most prosperous economy in the history of the world ought to give us the same access to their economy, right? (Applause.) That's what you call reciprocal. And he brought that principle into our trade negotiations. We renegotiated a trade agreement with South Korea that's been a win for American jobs. He actually just recently signed two new trade agreements with Japan. And we're continuing in negotiations for a free trade agreement with Japan. And negotiations , I'm sure you've seen in the newspapers , are ongoing with China. And President Trump put China on notice: The era of economic surrender is over. We're going to stand up for American jobs and American workers. (Applause.) We're doing it. But closer to home, what brings us here today is that President Trump negotiated what, once it's approved, will be the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The USMCA is, I can tell you, a state-of-the art trade agreement that will increase jobs and opportunities across Wisconsin and across America in everything from manufacturing to farming. It will protect intellectual property. It will promote innovation in business. It truly is an extraordinary agreement. You know, I was around a lot when the President was negotiating this agreement in his typically subtle way. (Laughter.) Those were a lot of memorable phone calls. (Laughter.) And I'll tell you what: Can I just say, being here in the Badger State , because we had to work out a little arrangement on dairy with Canada , and I'll tell you what: This President stood strong and fought hard for dairy and got a win in the USMCA. (Applause.) We did it. We did it. Despite the fact that this a , this is a win in the city and on the farm, it's still sitting there on the Democrat Speaker of House's desk. You know, the truth is, you all see in the newspapers that, these days, Democrats are spending their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment. But the American people deserve better. The American people want Congress to go to work for them. They want Congress to pass the USMCA. (Applause.) So that's really , it's why I came to Wisconsin, to say it's time for the Democrats in Congress to put Wisconsin jobs and Wisconsin workers first. The time has come for Congressman Ron Kind to tell his colleagues in Congress that Wisconsin and America need the USMCA, and we need it this year. (Applause.) I mean, there will be plenty of time for politics nest year , next year. We got to get this done. And I really came here to enlist all of your support to reach out to Congressman Kind and Democrats that represent Wisconsin in Washington, D.C. and tell them that. I mean, did you know that according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add like $68 billion to our economy right out of the box? And, we project, conservatively, that it will create more than 175,000 new jobs. Already this year, this company has exported more than $200 million worth of goods and services to Canada and Mexico alone. And I can tell you, for all the people wearing the red shirts and all the people that make this great company work, that's only going to go grow when the USMCA comes along. The truth is, the USMCA would , would preserve Uline's duty-free access to Canada and Mexico, and it would simplify the export process, saving this company time and money that can be used to create jobs and grow this business right here in Wisconsin. (Applause.) It's true. And make no mistake about it: The USMCA would benefit a lot of customers of this company, especially American manufacturers. In fact, 70 percent of the products that this company sells are manufactured right here in the United States. And the USMCA, we believe, will create nearly 50,000 good manufacturing jobs in this country and give manufacturing workers another raise, in addition to the wage increases we've already seen. You know, I don't know about the rest of you, but coming from just down the road in Indiana, I was , I remember the days when I had a different job. I was governor of the Hoosier State, and we actually had leaders in Washington, D.C. that said the days of a robust manufacturing economy in America were behind us. Remember? I mean, we had a President in 2016 who lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And in the summer of that election year, 2016, he actually said that those jobs were never going to come back. He asked, famously, ""What magic want do you have?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. (Applause.) Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created and counting. Manufacturing is back. (Applause.) I get pretty excited about this stuff , (laughter) , because America is prospering. America is growing. And here in the Heartland, where , we do two things well: We make things and we grow things. And this economy is , is booming. And so the truth is, for , for all of the companies like Uline, for all the suppliers of this company, there's just a lot to gain with USMCA, a lot to benefit the families that work at these companies that are part of your communities. And it's going to make a real difference. And the truth is, it's going to make a difference for Wisconsin as a whole. I mean, last year, the state of Wisconsin alone exported more than $22 billion in goods to Mexico and Canada, supporting more than 100,000 jobs in this state. Wisconsin's top two export markets are actually Canada and Mexico. So do the math, everybody. The USMCA is a win for Wisconsin and a win for America, and we got to get it done. (Applause.) We got to get it done. But I came here today , I came here today, just because it's really going to take all of us to do it , I came to Wisconsin to turn up the heat. I came here to turn up the heat on Congressman Ron Kind and the Democrats in Congress and say: Wisconsin wants the USMCA. That's your message. (Applause.) That's what you got to tell them. I mean, the clock is ticking. So I want you to reach out and , I want you to reach out to your elected representatives in Washington, D.C. , congressmen and senators. But I can save you a nickel. Okay? You don't need to call Senator Ron Johnson because he's leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate. (Applause.) He is. Great guy. And you don't need to call my friends, Congressman Bryan Steil or Congressman Glenn Grothman, because they are fighting every day for the USMCA in the House. (Applause.) Would you stand up again? Let's give these two congressmen a big round of applause. They're doing a phenomenal job for Wisconsin. (Applause.) Thank you, guys. In fact, all the Republican members of the Wisconsin delegation have been standing with him. But these two fellas have been doing an incredible job, and I'm honored that they'd be with us today. But you know, if you have a minute, you could call Senator Tammy Baldwin. (Laughter.) You could call Congressman Ron Kind. You could call every Democrat that represents Wisconsin in Washington, D.C. and say, ""I ran into Mike Pence and he said Wisconsin needs the USMCA."" And tell them we need to get it done. (Applause.) Seriously. Just say, ""You know, I was over at Uline the other day. I ran into Mike and he was just"" , (laughter) , ""just telling me how exciting this thing is."" I mean, it's bigger than politics. Okay? I mean, it seems like Washington, D.C. is always , always seems to find some partisan dividing line through things. But I'm going to tell you something. We have every confidence that when Speaker Nancy Pelosi puts the USMCA on the floor of the Congress, it's going to pass and it's going to pass on a bipartisan basis. Because when you get past all the politics and all the posturing, people know it's a win. So that's what I want you to tell them. I mean, pick up the phone, make a call. Send an email. Tweet. (Laughter.) But tell the Democrats representing Wisconsin in Washington, D.C. that Wisconsin and America need the USMCA. Will you do that for me? (Applause.) I need you to do it. So, thanks for coming out today. I won't keep you much longer. And I really am looking forward to meeting as many of you as , as time permits. And while I have you, let me just take the opportunity to say thank you, on behalf of my little family, for the privilege of serving as your Vice President. It is the greatest honor of my life. (Applause.) So thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you.Thank you for your confidence. (Applause.) Thank you for your confidence you placed in our little family and in this President, with whom I'm so honored to serve. And in the days and weeks ahead, I'll make you a promise: This President and his Vice President are going to keep working our hearts out to earn that confidence. (Applause.) I mean, I promise you, whatever the Democrats in Washington want to spend their time on, President Donald Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for you. We're never going to stop fighting for the agenda the people of Wisconsin elected us to advance. (Applause.) And let me say one other thing if I can, before I go. We have a great opportunity with the USMCA. And I really do hope , I hope you leave here with a little burden on your heart about going out and telling that story. The USMCA would be great for Wisconsin. It'd be great for America. But, you know, it's , in these divided times, I think it also will show the world that we can , we can still get important things done that benefit all of the American people. And maybe you'll send that message too when you reach out and call. I mean, President Trump drove a hard bargain with Mexico and Canada to put American jobs and American workers first. And I promise you, everybody wins under the USMCA.And I really think we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to demonstrate that, in these divided times, that we can still work together in our nation's capital when we put the American people first. And lastly, let me also say , you know, I have , I hear a lot of people talking about the things that divide our country these days. But I'll always be convinced, as long as I live, as I've traveled all across this country in this role and in my 60 times around the sun as an American, I'll always believe that there's , there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than could ever divide us. And chief among that is faith. (Applause.) So, Wisconsin, I want to encourage you to have faith. Have faith in this President and the agenda that Wisconsin voted to advance. It's making this country stronger and more prosperous and safer than ever before. Have faith in all these elected representatives that have been standing with this President at every level to keep the promises that we made to the people of this state, the people of this nation. Have faith in your neighbors and friends in the days ahead that when we continue to deliver on an agenda that's making the nation more secure and more prosperous, the American people can see through all of the noise and choose the better path , the path to a stronger, more prosperous America. And finally, have faith in the one who set this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores so long ago. Because I truly do believe that as we put our trust in Him, the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come. (Applause.) And with President Donald Trump in the White House, with the USMCA under our belt, with the strong support of the people of Wisconsin, and with God's help, I know we're going to make this state safer than ever before. We're going to make Wisconsin and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine. And in a word, we're going to keep America great. (Applause.) Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming out. Let's go get the USMCA done, and get it done this year. Thank you and God bless you. END 3:24 P.M.

VSMP2410201943	Mike Pence	2019-10-24	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Frederic V. Malek Memorial Lecture	speech	"11:51 A.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for that warm welcome. And to your new chairman, Governor Scott Walker; former Congresswoman Jane Harman; and to all the members of the board at this historic center; and to all the fine scholars: It is an honor to be here at the Wilson Center, named after a President that was a great champion for America leadership and for freedom on the world stage. And in that same spirit, allow me to begin this morning by bringing greetings from another President who's a champion for freedom here at home and across the wider world. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I come before you today at the end of a momentous week. In the wake of Turkish forces invading Syria, thanks to the strong economic and diplomatic action of the President of the United States, and thanks to the cooperation by our Turkish and Kurdish allies, Syrian Defense Forces were able to safely withdraw from the border area that's currently under Turkish military control. And yesterday, Turkey's Ministry of Defense confirmed a permanent cease-fire and a halt of all offensive military operations. (Applause.) Our troops are coming home. And I am pleased to report that through this ceasefire, Turkey and our Kurdish allies have now created an opportunity that the international community can create a safe zone that we believe will restore peace and security for all the peoples of this war-torn region. It is progress, indeed. So thank you again for the honor of being here today, and it's a particular honor to deliver the inaugural Frederic V. Malek Memorial Lecture. Anyone who knew Fred would tell you that he was a proud son of West Point and that he lived his life by the words ""duty, honor, and country."" When counseling others, I'm told, he often quoted his alma mater's Cadet Prayer and urged them to, as he would say, ""Choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong."" Fred understood that no one , least of all, nations , can defend their interests by forsaking their values. So in honor of Fred's memory, I come here today to discuss a subject on which much of the destiny of the 21st century will hinge: the United States relationship with China. Since the earliest days of this administration, President Trump has been determined to build a relationship with China on a foundation of candor, fairness, and mutual respect, in order to achieve, in his words, ""a more just, secure, and peaceful world."" One year ago this month, I spoke about many of Beijing's policies most harmful to America's interests and values, from China's debt diplomacy and military expansionism; its repression of people of faith; construction of a surveillance state; and, of course, to China's arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade, including tariffs, quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology transfer, and industrial subsidies. Past administrations have come and gone, and all were aware of these abuses. None were willing to upset the established Washington interests who not only permitted these abuses, but often profited from them. The political establishment was not only silent in the face of China's economic aggression and human rights abuses, but they often enabled them. As each year passed, as each factory closed in the heartland of America, as each new skyscraper went up in Beijing, American workers grew only more disheartened, and China grew only more emboldened. In less than two short decades, we've seen, as President Trump has said, ""the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world."" Over the past 17 years, China's GDP has grown more than nine-fold; it has become the second-largest economy in the world. Much of this success was driven by American investment in China. Beijing's actions have contributed to the United States' trade deficit with China that last year ran to more than $400 billion , nearly half of our global trade deficit. As President Trump has said many times, we rebuilt China over the last 25 years. No truer words were spoken, but those days are over. As history will surely note, in less than three years, President Donald Trump has changed that narrative forever. No longer will America and its leaders hope that economic engagement alone will transform Communist China's authoritarian state into a free and open society that respects private property, the rule of law, and international rules of commerce. Instead, as the President's 2017 National Security Strategy articulated, the United States now recognizes China as a strategic and economic rival. And I can attest firsthand, a strong majority of the American people, in the city and on the farm, are behind President Trump's clear-eyed vision of the U.S., China relationship. And the President's stand also enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Congress as well. Over the past year with that support, President Trump has taken bold and decisive action to correct the failed policies of the past, to strengthen America, to hold Beijing accountable, and to set our relationship on a more fair, stable, and constructive course for the good of both of our nations and the world. When our administration took office, China was on track to become the largest economy in the world. Experts predicted that China's economy would surpass the United States' economy in just a few short years. But thanks to bold economic agenda advanced by President Trump, all that has changed. From early on in this administration, this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history. We lowered the American corporate tax rate to mirror other corporate rates around the world. We rolled back federal regulation at record levels. We unleashed American energy. And President Trump has stood strong for free and fair trade. The result? America has the strongest economy in the history of the world. (Applause.) And the strongest economy in our own history. Unemployment today is at a 50-year low. There are more Americans working today than ever before. Median household income in the last two and half years has risen by more than $5,000. And that doesn't even account for the savings from the President's tax cuts or energy reforms for working families. Because of the President's policies, America has added trillions of dollars of wealth to our economy while China's economy continues to fall behind. To level the playing field for the American worker against unethical trade practices, President Trump levied tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods in 2018. And earlier this year, the President announced we would place tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese goods if significant issues in our trading relationship were not resolved by December of this year. To protect intellectual property rights and the privacy of our citizens and our national security, we've taken strong steps to curtail illegal behavior of Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE. And we've urged our allies around the world to build secure 5G networks that don't give Beijing control of our most sensitive infrastructure and data as well. And as we've grown stronger economically, President Trump has also signed the largest increases in our national defense in more than a generation: $2.5 trillion of new investment in our national defense just in the last three years. We've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. And to make it clear to Beijing that no nation has a right to claim the maritime commons as territorial seas, the United States, in the last year, has increased the tempo and scope of our freedom of navigation operations and strengthened our military presence across the Indo-Pacific. To uphold the values of freedom-loving people every year [everywhere], we've also called out the Chinese Communist Party for suppressing freedom of religion of the Chinese people. Millions of ethnic and religious minorities in China are struggling against the Party's efforts to eradicate their religious and cultural identities. The Communist Party in China has arrested Christian pastors, banned the sale of Bibles, demolished churches, and imprisoned more than one million Muslim Uighurs. We've held Beijing accountable for its treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang when, just last month, President Trump imposed visas restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials, as well as sanctions on 20 Chinese public security bureaus and 8 Chinese companies for their complicity in the persecution of Uighurs and other Chinese Muslims. (Applause.) And we've stood by Taiwan in defense of her hard-won freedoms. Under this administration, we've authorized additional military sales and recognized Taiwan's place as one of the world's great trading economies and beacons of Chinese culture and democracy. And as millions have taken to the streets in peaceful protest, we've spoken out on behalf of the people of Hong Kong. And President Trump has made it clear from early on that there must be a peaceful resolution that respects the rights of the people of Hong Kong, as outlined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. These are all historic actions. And no President before has so vigorously advanced America's interests in our relationship with China. In response to America's actions and resolve, some multinational corporations say our economic policies are too tough and that advancing our interests and our values runs contrary to better relations with China. Needless to say, we see it very differently. Despite the great power competition that is underway, and America's growing strength, we want better for China. That's why, for the first time in decades, under President Donald Trump's leadership, the United States is treating China's leaders exactly how the leaders of any great world power should be treated , with respect, yes, but also with consistency and candor. And in that spirit of candor, I must tell you that in the year since my Hudson speech, Beijing has still not taken significant action to improve our economic relationship. And on many other issues we've raised, Beijing's behavior has become even more aggressive and destabilizing. On the trade front, this past May, after months of painstaking negotiations resulted in mutual agreement on many key matters, at the last moment, China backed away , backed away from a 150-page agreement, sending both sides back to square one. Now, President Trump still believes Beijing wants to make a deal. And we welcome the support for American agriculture in the new phase one agreement and hope it can be signed as soon as the APEC Summit in Chile this week. But China knows there's a whole range of structural and significant issues between our two countries that also must be addressed. For instance, despite a 2015 promise in the Rose Garden by China's leader to cease and desist, China continues to aid and abet the theft of our intellectual property. Last July, the director of the FBI told Congress that of his agency's 1,000 active investigations into intellectual property theft, the majority involve China. American enterprises continue to lose hundreds of billions of dollars each year in intellectual property theft. Behind these statistics are not just businesses, but people, families, and dreams threatened by the violation of their rights and the theft of their genius. Free enterprise depends on the ability of risk-taking citizens to pursue their ambitions and reap the rewards of their sacrifice. When the product of their labor is stolen, when the sweat of their brow is made futile, it undermines our entire system of free enterprise. Last year alone, there's been case after case of intellectual property theft involving China. In March, Tesla filed suit against a former engineer who's been accused of stealing 300,000 files related to its own American-developed autopilot system, before bolting for a job at a Chinese self-driving car company. And last December, the Justice Department revealed that it had broken up a nearly four-year operation by a notorious hacking group within China's Ministry of State Security. These Chinese government officials stole the names and data of 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel, as well as ship maintenance information, with grave implications for our national security. Despite China's promises to crack down on Chinese fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the truth is, those deadly drugs also continue to flood across our borders, claiming the lives of thousands of Americans every month. And today, China's Communist Party is building a surveillance state unlike anything the world has ever seen. Hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras stare down from every vantage point. Ethnic minorities must navigate arbitrary checkpoints where police demand blood samples, fingerprints, voice recordings, and multiple angle head shots, and even iris scans. And China is now exporting to countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East the very same technological tools that it uses in its authoritarian regime: tools that it's deployed in places like Xinjiang; tools that it's deployed often with the help of American companies. And Beijing has also smashed the barriers between civilian and military technological domains , a doctrine that China calls ""military-civilian fusion."" By law and presidential fiat, companies in China , whether private, state-owned, or foreign , must share their technologies with the Chinese military. And China's military action in the region and its approach to its neighbors over the past year has also remained increasingly provocative. While China's leaders stood in the Rose Garden in 2015 and said that its country had, and I quote, ""no intention to militarize"" the South China Sea, Beijing has deployed advanced anti-ship and anti-air missiles atop an archipelago of military bases constructed on artificial islands. And Beijing has stepped up its use of what they call ""maritime militia"" vessels to regularly menace Filipino and Malaysian sailors and fishermen. And the Chinese Coast Guard has tried to strong-arm Vietnam from drilling for oil and natural gas off of Vietnam's own shores. In the East China Sea, in 2019, our close ally, Japan, is on track to scramble more fighter aircraft sorties in response to Chinese provocations than in any previous year in history. And China's Coast Guard has sent ships for more than 60 days in a row into the waters around the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan. China is also using its ""One Belt, One Road"" Initiative to establish footholds in ports around the world, ostensibly for commercial purposes, but those purposes could eventually become military. We see now the flag of Chinese ownership flying today in ports from Sri Lanka to Pakistan to Greece. And earlier this year, it was reported that Beijing had signed a secret agreement to establish a naval base in Cambodia. And it is reported that Beijing is even eyeing locations on the Atlantic Ocean that could serve as naval facilities. And while our administration will continue to respect the One China Policy , as reflected in the three joint communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act , through checkbook diplomacy, over the past year China has induced two more nations to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, increasing pressure on the democracy in Taiwan. The international community must never forget that its engagement with Taiwan does not threaten the peace; it protects peace on Taiwan and throughout the region. America will always believe that Taiwan's embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people. (Applause.) But nothing in the past year has put on display the Chinese Communist Party's antipathy to liberty so much as the unrest in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has served as an important gateway between China and the wider world for 150 years. Hong Kong is one of the freest economies in the world, with strong, independent legal institutions and a lively free press, and it's home to hundreds of thousands of foreign residents. Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty. And yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions to curtail the rights and liberties of its people , rights and liberties that were guaranteed through a binding international agreement of ""one country, two systems."" But President Trump has been clear, as he said in his words, ""The United States stands for liberty."" (Applause.) We respect the sovereignty of nations. But America expects Beijing to honor its commitments, and President Trump has repeatedly made it clear it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against protestors in Hong Kong. (Applause.) Since then, I'm pleased to observe that Hong Kong authorities have withdrawn the extradition bill that sparked the protests in the first place, and Beijing has shown some restraint. In the days ahead, I can assure you, the United States will continue to urge China to show restraint, to honor its commitments, and respect the people of Hong Kong. And to the millions in Hong Kong who have been peacefully demonstrating to protect your rights these past months, we stand with you. (Applause.) We are inspired by you, and we urge you to stay on the path of nonviolent protest. (Applause.) But know that you have the prayers and the admiration of millions of Americans. As China has exercised its influence across the region and across the world, as I said last year, the Chinese Communist Party is also continuing to reward and coerce American businesses, movie studios, universities, think tanks, scholars, journalists, and local, state, and federal officials to influence the public debate here in America. Today, China is not only exporting hundreds of billions of dollars in unfairly traded goods to the United States, but lately China has also been trying to export censorship , the hallmark of its regime. By exploiting corporate greed, Beijing is attempting to influence American public opinion, coercing corporate America. And far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China's money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values. Nike promotes itself as a so called ""social justice champion,"" but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door. Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet, which read: ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" And some of the NBA's biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China. In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime. A progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive; it is repressive. (Applause.) When American corporations, professional sports, pro athletes embrace censorship, it's not just wrong; it's un-American. American corporations should stand up for American values here at home and around the world. (Applause.) And Beijing's economic and strategic actions, its attempts to shape American public opinion, prove out what I said a year ago and it's just as true today: China wants a different American President, which is the ultimate proof that President Trump's leadership is working. America's economy is growing stronger by the day, and China's economy is paying the price. The President's strategy is correct. He's fighting for the American people, for American jobs and American workers like no one has before. And I promise you this administration will not stand down. (Applause.) That said, the President has also made it clear the United States does not seek confrontation with China. We seek a level playing field, open markets, fair trade, and a respect for our values. We are not seeking to contain China's development. We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders, like we have enjoyed for generations with China's people. And if China will step forward and seize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long, I know President Donald Trump is ready and willing to begin that new future , (applause) , just as America has done in the past. When Deng Xiaoping's ""Reform and Opening"" policy encouraged engagement and exchange with the outside world, the United States responded with open arms. We welcomed China's rise. We celebrated the remarkable accomplishment of 600 million people lifting themselves out of poverty. And America invested more than any other nation in China's economic resurgence. The American people want better for the people of China. But in pursuit of that end, we must take China as it is, not as we imagine or hope it might be someday. And people sometimes ask whether the Trump administration seeks to ""de-couple"" from China. The answer is a resounding ""no."" The United States seeks engagement with China and China's engagement with the wider world, but engagement in a manner consistent with fairness, mutual respect, and the international rules of commerce. But, so far, it appears the Chinese Communist Party continues to resist a true opening or a convergence with global norms. All that Beijing is doing today, from the Party's great firewall in cyberspace or to that great wall of sand in the South China Sea, from their distrust of Hong Kong's autonomy, or their repression of people of faith all demonstrate that it's the Chinese Communist Party that has been ""de-coupling"" from the wider world for decades. President Xi himself, I'm told, said in a once-secret speech shortly after his rise as Party General Secretary that China must ""conscientiously prepare for all aspects of long-term cooperation and struggle between the two social systems."" He also told his colleagues at that time not to underestimate the resilience of the West. And there was wisdom in those words. China should never underestimate the resilience of the freedom-loving people of America or the resolve of the President of the United States. (Applause.) China should know that the United States' values run deep, that our commitment to these values remains as strong as it was for our Founding Fathers, and that there will never be a day when the bright light of democracy and freedom goes out in America. (Applause.) America was born out of rebellion against repression and tyranny. Our nation was founded, settled, and pioneered by men and women of extraordinary valor, rugged determination, faith, and fiery independence and an iron will. And nothing has changed much in the centuries that have passed. Americans believe that all men and women are created equal and we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And nothing will change these beliefs. (Applause.) They are who we are. They are who we will always be. And we will continue to believe that the values of democracy , of individual liberty, of freedom of religion and conscience, the rule of law , serve American and global interests because they are, and will ever be, the best form of government to unleash human aspirations and guide the relations between all the world's nations and peoples. Despite the many challenges we face in the United States-China relationship, I can assure you that under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States will not allow these challenges to foreclose practical cooperation with China. We will continue to negotiate in good faith with China to bring about long-overdue structural reforms in our economic relationship. And as I heard again from him this morning, President Trump remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached. We'll continue to forge bonds between our two peoples through education, travel, and cultural exchange. China and the United States will also continue in a spirit of engagement to work together to secure the full, final, and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea. And we will seek greater cooperation on arms control and the enforcement of U.S. sanctions in the Persian Gulf. America will continue to seek a better relationship with China. And as we do so, we will speak plainly, because this is a relationship that both the United States and China have to get right. America will continue to seek a fundamental restructuring of our relationship with China. And under the leadership of President Donald Trump, America will stay the course. The American people and their elected officials in both parties will stay resolved. We will defend our interests. We will defend our values. And we will do so in a spirit of charity and good will for all. (Applause.) President Trump has forged a strong personal relationship with President Xi. And on that foundation, we will continue to look for ways to strengthen our relationship for the betterment of both of our peoples. And we fervently believe the United States and China can and must work to share a peaceful and prosperous future together. But only honest dialogue and good-faith negotiations can make that future a reality. And so, as I closed my speech a year ago, so I close today: America is reaching out our hand to China. And we hope that, soon, Beijing will reach back, this time with deeds, not words, and with renewed respect for America. There is an ancient Chinese proverb that reads, ""Men see only the present, but Heaven sees the future."" As we go forward, let us pursue a future of peace and prosperity with resolve and faith. Faith in President Trump's leadership and vision for our economy and our place in the world, and faith in the relationship that he has forged with President Xi of China and in the enduring friendship between the American people and the Chinese people. And faith that Heaven sees the future , and by God's grace, America and China will meet that future together. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

VSMP1111201942	Mike Pence	2019-11-11	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Department of Veterans Affairs' National Veterans Day Observance | Arlingto ...	speech	"11:57 A.M. EST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. It is the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. One hundred years ago, on this day, America first celebrated Armistice Day, marking the anniversary of the day in 1918 when the guns of World War One fell silent. You know, there is a day in May when we remember those who served and did not come home. But today, all across America, in gatherings large and small, in cities and towns, we pause to remember all those who served in uniform and did come home. It is Veterans Day in America. (Applause.) To Vice President Quayle, to Secretary Esper, to Secretary Wilkie, Secretary DeVos and Scalia, to Congressman Takano, to Commander Kowalski, to Director Durham-Aguilera, to all the distinguished guests and fellow Americans who are gathered here: It's an honor to be with you all, but most especially it is a high honor for me to stand before you in this special place among men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America today and our veterans who served our country in uniform in ages past. (Applause.) It's my great honor to welcome you here to Arlington National Cemetery for the 2019 National Veterans Day Observance. And I'm grateful that you all would make time, as millions of Americans will do all across this nation, to honor all those who served. The Bible tells us: If you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And today, here at Arlington and all across this nation, Americans gather to pay a debt of gratitude to the generations who've answered the call to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States. It's also my great honor to be here on behalf of a great champion of our armed forces and of every veteran across this nation. So allow me to begin by bringing greetings and gratitude from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) This morning, our President made history, becoming the first President ever to kick off the annual Veterans Day Parade in New York City. But though he is in New York, I know his heart is here with all of you and with every Veterans Day service across the country. As the President said just moments ago, in his words, ""Today, we come together as one nation to salute the veterans of the United States Armed Forces , the greatest warriors ever [to] walk [on] the face of the Earth."" (Applause.) As the President said, you risked everything for us. And now it's our duty to serve you, and serving and protecting our veterans, and keeping our promises to our veterans we will do every day of our lives. (Applause.) So to all the veterans gathered here, as well as all of those looking on, from the heart of a grateful nation: Thank you for your service. We're proud of you , (applause) , every single one of you. And just as you fought for us, I promise you, this President, this Vice President, and our administration will always fight for you. (Applause.) As President Trump has said, a ""spirit of strength lives within the heart of every American warrior."" And ""that spirit has helped our fighters defeat tyrants, conquer fascism, vanquish communism, and face down terrorism."" And so he rightly said. Our first President said in his farewell orders to the Continental Army these words: ""The unparalleled perseverance of the armies of the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing miracle."" So said George Washington and so it can be said of every veteran throughout the long and storied history of this nation. (Applause.) You're a standing miracle. From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood, from San Juan Hill to Saipan, from the Coral Reef to Kandahar, nearly 50 million men and women have donned the uniform of the United States, and nearly 20 million of you still walk among us today. And as we speak, a new generation of American heroes and veterans is being forged around the nation and around the world. As I look out today, it's a truly humbling sight. I see men and women who served in World War Two, in the Korean War, in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. I see many more who've stood watch over our country in times of peace. So, if you are able, if you've worn the uniform of the United States of America, would you please stand and give us one more opportunity to show the gratitude of this nation for your service? (Applause.) Thank you for your service. Thank you for your service. It truly is humbling to be with all of you. Our veterans really don't consider themselves heroes. To speak to them, most of them reject the very thought of it. Most of them say, as Iraq War veteran Army Specialist Christopher Gamblin said not long ago, and I quote , he said he was, quote, ""just some guy that did his job."" And my dad, a combat veteran from the Korean War, used to say with equal humility, the heroes were the guys that didn't make it home. But on this day, it's our day to set the record straight. Every veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States is a hero to the American people. (Applause.) And on this day, it's our duty to tell your story , the story of what you did for us, what you did for our country, and all that you've done to ensure the survival and the success of liberty. Our veterans have distinguished themselves in combat , like a man who joined me on this occasion two years ago. Thirty-eight years ago this March, he was serving his country in Vietnam. Back then, he was a first lieutenant in the United States Army, 1st Battalion, 92nd Artillery. And one morning, he awoke to a massive North Vietnamese attack on a hilltop outpost. He and his brothers-in-arms were heavily outnumbered, and it took just minutes for the enemy to break through their defenses. But this first lieutenant rallied. He rallied his brothers to stand their ground. He ordered air and artillery strikes from what would later be described as a ""dangerously exposed position"" for four straight hours. As the situation worsened, he was , he personally directed the withdrawal and provided cover fire. And to ensure his brothers-in-arms' safety, and to inflict maximum damage on the enemy, he actually called in an artillery strike on his own position. Wounded and unable to escape himself, he managed to evade detection for eight long days, until he was rescued by American forces that retook the outpost. For his conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty, he received, of course, the Medal of Honor. Would you join me in thanking a true American hero, Medal of Honor Recipient, First Lieutenant Brian Thacker? (Applause.) So we remember those who served in combat. But on this Veterans Day, we also do well to remember that our veterans' contributions to our country continue long after you come home. They continue to serve our country in civilian life. You lead in business, in education, in law enforcement, and public service at every level. And wherever you go, you do what you always did when you were serving in uniform. Our veterans show the same sense of duty and courage that defined your years in the armed forces. For a veteran of the United States Armed Forces, service doesn't end when they hang up the uniform; service is a lifelong calling. (Applause.) Like a Marine sergeant who joins us here today, during his time in uniform, he was an 81 millimeter mortarman, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines. But after he came home, he went to college, played a little football, played in the Orange Bowl, got a masters' degree, and then joined the VA. And for the last 10 years, he has worked tirelessly to fulfill the words of our nation's 16th President, to care for them that ""shall have borne the battle."" So would you join me in thanking Sergeant Matt Webb for a lifetime of service to America? (Applause.) Serving our veterans and meeting their needs. And we thank you, Sergeant, for continuing that service. And as I stand before you today, I can tell you from my heart, I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and every veteran in America. (Applause.) Since the first day of our administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to ensure that America keeps the solemn promises that we've made to each and every one of you and to all of our nation's heroes. This President and this administration know veterans' benefits are not entitlements; they are the ongoing compensation for services rendered in the uniform of the United States. (Applause.) And under this President's leadership, we've been working to keep those promises. We passed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in more than 50 years. And Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America. (Applause.) And to end an era of heartbreaking abuse and neglect, President Trump also signed the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act to ensure that our veterans receive the highest quality of care in the VA system. And under our administration, we've fired more than 8,000 employees for negligent behavior. And the wait times for patients have dropped by 33 percent. In fact, the wait times are shorter at the VA than they are in the private sector medical system. (Applause.) That's how you do it for our heroes. And as our 40th President once said, ""Veterans know better than anyone else the price of freedom,"" because you've ""suffered the scars of war."" And the truth is, not all the wounds of war are visible. Often, after they come home, our combat veterans struggle with the weight of having defended our freedom on the field of battle. That's why, at President Trump's direction, we've increased funding for mental health services by almost $9 billion. And the VA is now providing mental health screenings to every patient who walks through the door. (Applause.) And to all of our heroes gathered here and to all of those looking on, let me say , let me say from the heart: If you are a veteran who's struggling with the return to civilian life, or if you have a family member or a friend or a neighbor who you know is similarly burdened, just know that there is help available today. And just as you were there for us, we will be there for you, to see you through this time. (Applause.) So we've been providing for the practical needs of those who served, but also, from the first day of this administration, this President has taken steps to ensure that our returning veterans can live the American Dream that they fought so nobly to defend. In fact, President Trump signed legislation to expand the post-9/11 GI Bill so that veterans can get up to $24,000 to attend the college of their choice at any point in their lives. (Applause.) And three months ago, President Trump directed the Department of Education to eliminate every last penny of student debt owed by a permanently disabled veteran. (Applause.) With the stroke of a pen, the President wiped out $750 million owed by more than 25,000 heroes. And thanks to the President's leadership, not only are we making education more available and more affordable for our veterans, but our returning veterans are also coming back to an American economy that is booming. And veterans' unemployment is at a 19-year low. (Applause.) On this Veterans Day, we honor those who served, like all of you gathered here. We honor you with tributes and promises kept. But as our veterans understand better than most, we also honor your service by ensuring that the men and women in our armed forces today have the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation. And this we have done. (Applause.) As they proved just two weeks ago in a raid that took out the world's number one terrorist leader, the Armed Forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. (Applause.) And I'm proud to report to all the veterans gathered here and those looking on that, from the first day of this administration, President Trump has taken action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. This President has actually signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest pay raise for our armed forces in more than 10 years. (Applause.) And I'll make a promise to all the veterans gathered here: Under this President's leadership, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard will always have the resources and the support that they need, so help us God. (Applause.) So, it's Veterans Day in America, the day we honor all of you who stepped forward and answered the call to defend this nation at home and abroad. You came from the rest of us, but we know you are the best of us. And on this day and every day, we honor your courage, your patriotism, and what you've done for us. You put on the armor, you stood in the gap, and you defended our freedom. You counted our lives more important than your own. You stood for a cause greater than yourselves. Nine years ago this month, a 21-year-old Marine was serving our country in Afghanistan. History records he was on top of a house with his fellow Marine, looking out at a village around them, when suddenly an insurgent threw a grenade on the roof. And without a moment's hesitation, he threw himself on the grenade and absorbed the impact of the blast. He suffered terrible injuries. Every part of his body that wasn't protected was injured: face, neck, thigh, foot, lung. But somehow he survived. While he was being treated, he went into cardiac arrest three times. He's undergone more than 70 procedures during 40 separate surgeries. But people who know him know that that hasn't slowed him down. Today, he's a published author, a popular speaker, a marathon runner, and his faith in God and his patriotism has been an inspiration to millions. And I promise you, and him, that the American people will never forget or fail to honor the service of the youngest living recipient of the Medal of Honor, Corporal Kyle Carpenter. (Applause.) I mentioned Kyle because of his heroism, because of what he said not long ago. He wrote a memoir of his life, and he told a story of a day that he got into an Uber on his way to the airport, and he started chatting with the driver. He said they talked about their lives. He share what he'd been through serving our country. And as the conversation wound down, as it does for so many of you veterans, the driver turned and looked at him and said those words that he often hears: ""Thank you for your service."" But in that moment, as he wrote later, Corporal Carpenter gave a reply that surprised even him. He looked at the driver after he heard those words, and said, ""You're worth it."" As he wrote later, he had wondered to himself, ""Why did I say that?"" But then he realized, in his words, ""In that moment, I wanted him to know that his family, his freedom, his rights, just the simple fact that he was a human being, meant that he was worth sacrificing for and that's what I've come to realize serving in the military means "" (Applause.) It was a small moment but with a big meaning. In a single sentence, Lance Corporal Carpenter captured the spirit of every veteran. I could see it in the faces sitting before me when I recited those words, and the gentle nods that so many of you just gave. When you put on the uniform of the United States, you said we're worth it, that our freedom is worth it and America is worth it. And on this day, on behalf of your President and a grateful nation, thank you. Thank you for considering us worthy of your all and service to this country. (Applause.) So it's Veterans Day in America. And to my fellow Americans who did not serve in uniform, I have a challenge for you today. I challenge every American who do not follow a calling into service, before the day is out , whether at home or at work, on a street corner, or over a backyard fence , find a veteran. Whether they came home in the last week or in the last century, extend your hand and say those words that they never ask to hear but they deserve to hear every day. Find a veteran today and say, ""Thank you for your service."" Because every single one of you deserve to hear it every day. (Applause.) So thank you for the honor of addressing you in this special place. God bless our veterans and their families. God bless our fallen. God bless the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces of the United States today. And may God continue to bless the United States of America with heroes like all of you. Thank you. (Applause.)

VSMP1211201941	Mike Pence	2019-11-12	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the 2019 National Adoption Month Celebration	speech	"12:15 P.M. EST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Secretary Azar. And to the Secretary, to Surgeon General Jerome Adams, Assistant Secretary Lynn Johnson, the Associate Commissioner Jerry Milner, to all the many families gathered here and those looking on who've answered the call to open your hearts and your homes: It is wonderful to be here at HHS and to be a part of the most pro-adoption administration in American history. (Applause.) And I want to thank each and every one of you for the role that you're playing. And especially, I want to congratulate the honorees who will be recognized as a part of this program today. Each and every one of you have opened your homes and opened your hearts to become forever families. And I want you to know that you have the respect of this President, of his Vice President, and of the American people. And I offer my heartfelt congratulations. I also want to , I also want to express appreciation to the Secretary of HHS. He and I worked together in the state of Indiana. He's a man who has built an extraordinary career. But I know of no one in this administration with a greater heart for American families than Secretary Alex Azar. Would you join me in thanking him for his great work? (Applause.) You can get on your feet if you feel as strongly about him as I do. Secretary Alex Azar, everybody. (Applause.) And the whole HHS team deserves that same round of applause. And there's so many good friends in the room, but there's one friend I haven't seen for a little while. She and I both served as governors of our home state and she emerged as a national leader. And her faith and her dedication to family has literally inspired millions of Americans. And I'm not surprised that when we were talking about adoption, Governor Sarah Palin had to be with us today. Governor Palin, thank you so much for joining us and for your great support of adoptive families across America. (Applause.) And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine who is a great champion of American families and a strong champion of adoption and adoptive families. I bring greetings and the admiration of the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, in his proclamation on this National Adoption Month, President Trump acknowledged, in his words, that, ""Every child , born and unborn , is uniquely gifted by their Creator and endowed with both [the] potential and immeasurable value,"" and that, in this month, we, as Americans ""recognize the loving and devoted individuals who are part of God's plan for every child by taking a role as a parent through adoption."" For the last quarter century, Americans all across this country have taken time during this month to celebrate adoptive families and to celebrate adoption in this country. In November 1984, President Ronald Reagan marked the very first National Adoption Week to encourage a national effort to promote the adoption of children, and particularly children with special needs. And just a few years later, this week was expanded into an entire month. And today's gathering here at HHS is just one more installment in the admiration and gratitude the American people feel to all of our adoptive families. Every year since, leaders in government, industry, and faith communities have come together to raise awareness for the need to help vulnerable children to find permanent families and forever homes. And since the first day of this administration, under the leadership of this President, and with the hard work of all the dedicated men and women here at HHS, I'm proud to say that we've been working tirelessly to advance that vision to strengthen families and support the most vulnerable among us, including, we've been working every day to reduce the need for children to enter foster care in the first place. (Applause.) Last year, President Trump signed into law the Family First Prevention Act, which matches federal funds with state programs to help parents get the help they need to keep their children at home, to keep them safe from substance abuse and the challenges of mental illness. It's expanded resources to combat substance abuse and provide mental health services and family counseling at the state level across this country. And as the President said at the time, ""Providing a stable, [and] secure, and nurturing home environment is one of the greatest gifts a parent or [a] guardian can give to a child."" That also includes a foster parent. And when it becomes necessary for children to be placed in foster care, this legislation made it easier than ever for states to find safe, loving families to care for them. And I'm proud to report that, this year, for the first time in nearly 10 years, we've actually seen the number of children placed in foster care decline across America. (Applause.) We're keeping families together and addressing the real needs and challenges they face. In fact, last year, more children than ever , that more children than ever were not only , not only , excuse me, let me say, last year, we saw a decline in the number of children going to foster care. But maybe most encouraging to everyone gathered here at this important celebration: Last year, more children than ever were adopted from foster care, as well, to forever families. (Applause.) It's amazing to think, because of the generosity and the large-heartedness of families just like those we're celebrating today, more than 63,000 children found their forever homes with the help and support of loving families across this country. It really is incredible. So, recommendations to foster care are declining, and those in foster care are being adopted at a record pace. That's real success for strengthening families in America. And this success requires all of us to continue to work together. And it depends on generosity and love and the dedication of countless adoptive families, like a family I heard about on the way here, who, not long ago, grew from four to five through adoption. I'm told they met their future daughter through school where , where their her new mom works as a counselor and a school teacher. And this young woman lost her father when she was two; she lost her mother when she was 10. And after years of living in a group home, I'm told that she'd actually given up , she'd given up on ever being adopted, believing, as she said , she said, ""I was alone, and I knew I was going to be alone forever."" But she was wrong. And just 51 days before her 18th birthday, that young woman had a new brother, a new sister, two new parents, and a new last name. Now she's in college, and she's studying to be an art therapist. So would you join me in recognizing one of this year's Adoption Excellence Award winners: her mom and dad Chris and Gigi Kean, and their wonderful and inspiring daughter, Maci? Where are you? (Applause.) Great. Great to have you all here. And thank you for your inspiring example. What a special, special family. And let me tell you, as you study to be an art therapist, the Second Lady of the United States is going to be excited to hear that. (Laughter.) She's become one of the premier champions of art therapy across this country. So, much success to you, Maci. Today, we're also recognizing a family from Minnesota, who I'm told, adopted their youngest but tallest family member , (laugher) , just a few years ago, and they were already the picture of the American Dream: two successful parents; a passionate and philanthropic daughter; a dedicated son, well on his way to becoming an Eagle Scout. But they felt the need , they felt the call to foster a child for years. And after discovering how many older children age out of potential adoption, they decided to begin the journey towards adopting a teenager. Eventually, I'm told, they were matched with a young man who had spent most of his adolescence in foster care. And before long, they knew where he belonged. They knew he belonged in their home and to be a part of their forever family. In fact, his mother's words said he, at one point, looked them in the eye and said, ""I want to join your family."" And their family said ""yes."" Today, this family five does everything together, including advocating for adoption, part of what we'll celebrate today: adoption, especially of adolescent and older children. So join me in thanking another one of this year's Adoption Excellence Award winners, Scott and Amy Arntson, and their incredible son, Isaiah. Take a bow, will you? (Applause.) That's great. Thank you, Amy. Great job. Really great job. You know, these incredible families are emblematic of all of our honorees today and, frankly, emblematic of adoptive families all across this country. And they represent the shared success of all of us working together to expand opportunities for adoption, to expand and develop all across this country. So , but for all of our honorees, give them all a round of applause. They're all going to be recognized. You all inspire us. But we're here today because families like these, and businesses and local governments, have all worked together to expand access to adoption all across this country. And I want to assure you, under this President and this Vice President and our entire administration, we're going to continue to work to expand adoption for families all across America. (Applause.) But we understand there's still , there's still more work to do. And the truth is, every year, some 20,000 young people age out of foster care without the support of a permanent family to help them navigate those early years of adulthood. And even now, more than 125,000 children are in foster care across the country, waiting for adoption. And more than half have been in foster care for more than two years. So while we celebrate the progress that we've made , 63,000 children from foster care to forever families , I know I don't have to tell any and all of you here that there's much more work to be done. And I promise you, at the President's direction, this administration will continue to work with all of you, with leaders in local government and business and communities all across this country, and we'll continue to work in public and private partnerships to promote adoption across the land , like those being created by one of our award winners today, the Child Welfare Division of Louisiana's Department of Child and Family Services, which I am told has actually achieved three consecutive years of record-breaking adoption numbers in their state. (Applause.) Wow. Where's that team? Who's representing that wonderful child welfare team? Take a bow, will you, please? Fantastic job. And we're also inspired by organizations like America's Kids Belong that's going to be honored here today. It matches older children and youth aging out of foster care with generous supporters who are out there meeting their basic needs, connecting them with new opportunities, including for employment, helping them to achieve their dreams. So how about a big round of applause for that team, too? Where are you? (Applause.) Take a bow. Thank you. And let me assure all of you that we also understand the role that communities of faith play in adoption. And we're going to continue to support many faith-based organizations that have always and will continue to play a vital role in helping vulnerable children find forever homes. And I couldn't be more proud that, at President Trump's direction, and with the strong support of leaders across foster care, adoption, and our faith communities, we've taken decisive action. We've reversed the rule implemented in the closing days of the last administration that jeopardized the ability of faith-based providers to serve those in need by penalizing them for their deeply held religious beliefs. We will stand for the freedom of religion and we will stand with faith-based organizations to support adoption. (Applause.) Thank you. And I want to commend Secretary Azar and the team here at HHS for promulgating the new rule that respects the freedom of religion of every American, but also recognizes the vital role that faith-based organizations play in adoption in this country. So I thank you, Mr. Secretary, and I thank the HHS team. I know the President is grateful. The truth is, four out of five families have pointed to faith and church support as a factor in successful fostering. And countless families rely on their faith communities as they adopt and incorporate children into their lives. And I'll make you one more promise: Child welfare providers will never be forced to choose between their faith and serving those in need , not on our watch. (Applause.) So I thank you all for allowing me to join you today. This is a great celebration, and it's one that's near and dear to my heart. And it's such an honor for me to be a part of the most pro-adoption administration in this history. And as I said earlier, the President talked about every child , born and unborn , being a sacred gift from God. And I truly do believe that if you're going to be pro-life, you need to be pro-adoption. And we are. (Applause.) And the truth is, I have some personal experience in this , or at least we almost did in our family. When Karen and I were starting to get our family going, we went through , as many couples do , years of unexplained infertility. And so we began to enter the adoptive process. We prayed through it. We made the decision that we would adopt a child, believing that maybe that was how God was going to put our little family together. And when the call came that we were in the queue for an adoption, the call also came from our doctor that Karen was expecting after five and a half years of unexplained infertility. We only had one question though. And that was: The second family in line, were they clinically infertile? Because we had already decided to open our hearts and our home to a child. And when we learned that the family right after us could not adopt , or could not have a child, we stepped out of the way because God was blessing us with a family and we wanted Him to be able to bless them as well. (Applause.) But we'd already crossed that threshold. Like the adoptive families that we'll celebrate here today, we had already made the decision. And so while I've not experienced the blessing of being an adoptive family, I , I understand the decision that you make in doing it. And I admire it deeply, as does every American. I mean, the truth of the matter is that people deserve to know that there's roughly the same number of couples experiencing unfertility , infertility in this country than there are abortions. Literally, year after year, the number of families that struggle with unexplained infertility is roughly equal to the number of abortions. And so, I truly do believe as we stand without apology for the sanctity of life, we must stand for and expand access to adoption in America. That's how we make progress, by putting families together. (Applause.) So thank you again. Thank you for letting me share that from my heart. And thank you for letting me come and just congratulate each and every one of you today. Thank you for stepping up to serve those in need, through foster care, through adoption. What you do, you do for the most vulnerable among us. And you do for America. And during this National Adoption Month, know that your compassion and your love are changing lives and they're changing this country. And never doubt that the American people are with you, that they admire you. I'm sure you hear it as you get stopped outside of CVS or people stop you at work and worship and just express their admiration for your decision to become adoptive parents. Never doubt that this President and our entire administration stand with you to continue to expand and support adoption and lift it up as a means of expanding forever families across this country. And I also believe that you should never doubt that He , who said, whatever you do for the least of these, you do for me , will bless every family that opens their home and their hearts to adoption. So thank you to our honorees. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless your forever families. And God bless America. (Applause.) END 12:35 P.M.

VSMP1411201940	Mike Pence	2019-11-14	Remarks by Vice President Pence to NASA's Ames Research Center Employees and Guests | Moffett Field, CA	speech	"12:38 P.M. PST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. Join me in thanking the NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine, one more time. He's doing a fantastic job. (Applause.) I want to thank you, Jim, for that kind introduction. And it really is my great honor not just as Vice President but, as he said, as Chairman of the National Space Council, to be here in the heart of Silicon Valley with the men and women of NASA Ames Research Center, forging the future. (Applause.) What a great group. We got a lot to talk about today, about renewed American leadership in space and the role that NASA Ames will play and has always played in American leadership in the great beyond. But before I begin, allow me to take a moment to address a matter that I know is on the hearts and minds of people all across California and all across the nation: the shooting that took place at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita earlier today. Five people were injured, and, tragically, a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy have lost their lives. This was another heartbreaking day for students and parents in America. In this nation, we mourn with those who mourn and we grieve with those who grieve. And to the families of those who lost loved ones, and to those who were critically injured, on behalf of the American people, I say from my heart: The hearts of every American are with you today. Our prayers are with you. And our prayers are with all the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff that are treating your loved ones at this very hour. I spoke to President Trump not long ago, and he asked me to convey his deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and the entire Santa Clarita community. I also spoke to LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, and I informed him that President Trump has directed the full resources of the federal government to support local law enforcement efforts as the investigation goes forward. And our teams are already on the ground. And let me say, on behalf of the President, we commend the swift response of local law enforcement and school officials. They undoubtedly saved lives. (Applause.) So our hearts are with the families of the victims in Santa Clarita today. Our hearts are with everyone in that community in the difficult days that lies ahead. And so will they remain in our prayers. But to every American, and all of you gathered here, we say: This President and this administration will remain resolved to bring the scourge of mass shootings to an end. And we will not rest or relent until we end this evil in our time and make our schools and our communities safe again. (Applause.) So thank you for that. And thank you again for the warm welcome. It really is great to be here at NASA Ames Research Center. I passed through not long ago, but I promised to come back , (laughter) , because you all have been making history for a long time. And we're about to make even more history, and it'll pass right through NASA Ames and all of your incredible talents. (Applause.) It will. To Dr. Tu and all the innovators and visionaries here who are designing and building that bright future of American leadership in space, it's a great honor to join you here in the beating heart of Silicon Valley at the NASA Ames Research Center. And let me bring greetings from that man I mentioned just a few moments ago and a leader who is even more committed than your Vice President to securing American leadership on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) In his inaugural address to the nation, President Trump proclaimed that the United States stands, in his words, ""at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space."" So it's a particular honor for me to be here with all of you today, three years into that effort and that renewed American leadership, to stand in the place where, 80 years ago this year, the United States established the second laboratory for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which was the precursor to NASA. From its earliest days, history records that it was Ames researchers who developed many of the groundbreaking technologies that have paved the way for modern aviation, space exploration, and cutting-edge computing. And you're doing it all the way through today. Innovators here at Ames have built some of the world's largest and most sophisticated wind tunnels, which have helped advance our understanding of aerodynamics and expanded our knowledge of flight, both in this atmosphere and in the outer worlds. And as I just learned talking to some of your team members, you even train and prepare some of the latest technologies to keep America safe and strengthen our national defense. Thank you, NASA Ames. (Applause.) Jim just mentioned I spent some time in that simulator, and I got it down okay. (Laughter.) But I have to tell you, I was very moved, as I was getting ready to go in the simulator, that I learned not only do they train astronauts that will be returning to the surface of the Moon, but they also were , that same facility was used to train F-35 pilots. And I just happen to be the proud father of a United States Marine aviator who flies one of them. (Applause.) So thank you, Ames. Thank you for your contributions to our national defense. You know, many of our fundamental flight technologies wouldn't be possible without the revolutionary work that you've done here. From the swept-back wing used in high-speed aircraft, to the blunt body concept, which prevents spacecraft from burning up during planetary reentry, and the Viking Lander, which was the first spacecraft in human history to perform experiments on Mars , it all came through here and through the technology and innovation of NASA Ames. For 80 years, the brilliant men and women who work here have developed the technologies of the future, demonstrating the power of American ingenuity and inspiring a rising generation across our nation and across the world. In fact, I'm actually told that Steve Jobs said that he fell in love with computers when he saw one that was in use for the first time as a boy visiting NASA Ames. (Applause.) You've been inspiring generations, transforming American leadership and transforming our nation in so many ways. So on behalf of our grateful nation, let me just begin by saying thank you. Thank you to all of you at today's NASA Ames for carrying on the proud tradition of this great institution. (Applause.) Great job. Fantastic. And, you know, just as NASA Ames has been at the center of American leadership in space in years past, let me assure you NASA Ames will be at the center of American renewed leadership in space for decades to come. (Applause.) Earlier today, I toured your state-of-the-art Arc Jet facility, which tests the spacecraft and equipment that'll keep our space pioneers safe. I saw firsthand that Vertical Motion Simulator, which prepares astronauts for flight in space. And I got a chance to move it around a little bit myself. And I know all of you are proud to be developing the VIPER rover that I got a firsthand look at, which will allow us to explore and perform experiments on south pole of the Moon in preparation for our return of human American astronauts to the surface of the Moon. (Applause.) And rest assured these technologies, the incredible work being done here at NASA Ames, is going to play a critical role in that new chapter of American history in space. Because at President Trump's direction, we've put an end to decades of budget cuts and declining commitment to American leadership in space. We've renewed America's commitment to human space exploration. And, at the direction of this President, we are going to go farther and faster and higher than ever before. I promise you. (Applause.) And let me take a moment just to thank some great Americans who've come out of extraordinary backgrounds and experiences, who are actually here with us today. The National Space Council was reestablished by President Trump shortly after our administration took office. But we brought together a group of extraordinary Americans in what we call the User Advisory Group. And they've been making recommendations and detailed proposals that President Trump has been implementing ever since. So join me thanking the Chairman of the User Advisory Group, Admiral Jim Ellis, and also Eric Stallmer, and Fred Klipsch , three distinguished Americans , (applause) , in making an incredible job. Thank you, Admiral. With the steady counsel of these experts and our National Space Council, President Trump has been busy at work. In fact, in our first year in office, President Trump signed what came to be known as Space Policy Directive-1, making it the national policy of the United States of America to return to the Moon and prioritize crewed missions on the lunar surface. We're going back. (Applause.) In fact , in fact, we're not only going back to the Moon, but rather, in just a matter of a few months, thanks to the energetic leadership of this President and the strong efforts that all of you have made, after years of being out of the launch business, we're going to be back. And before spring arrives next year, we're going to send American astronauts on American rockets, from American soil, back into space. (Applause.) We're going to have our own platforms to take us back, and we don't need to hitch a ride with the Russians anymore. And earlier this year, I was proud to be a part when President Trump announced that it's the policy of this administration to return to the Moon within the next five years. And we will ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts. (Applause.) Artemis is here! (Applause.) And as the President reflected, we will ""return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use,"" not only to ""plant our flag and leave our footprint,"" but to ""establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars."" (Applause.) So now you know why Jim Bridenstine is so excited. (Laughter.) And I want to tell all of you here at NASA Ames: You're going to be busier than ever before. (Applause.) But we celebrated , we celebrated a lot this year: the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. But Apollo is in the books, and Artemis is here to stay. (Applause.) And I'm proud to report, thanks to all the work you're doing here, that we're well on our way to making NASA's new Moon-to-Mars Mission a reality. And I really wanted to thank you each and every one for your efforts. And unlike in years past, under this President's leadership, I'm proud to report we not only have the will, we not only have the support of the American people, we not only have the greatest innovators and inventors, but we also have the budgets to match. We're going to give NASA the resources they need to accomplish their mission. In fact, this President has already signed into law the largest budget ever for this agency in the modern era, and we're about to add another billion and a half. (Applause.) In fact, if you run into members of Congress or senators from here in California, you can say, ""I ran into Mike the other day"" , (laughter) , ""and he said ""1.6 billion more.' Put it in the budget. We'll get it done."" And for us to take the next big leap toward Mars, you here at Ames are going to be a critical part of helping us develop the technologies to live on the Moon not for days, but for months and even years. And we'll learn how to make use of all of the resources the Moon has to offer. And that lander I just looked at is going to do that exploration as soon as 2022. It includes mining oxygen from lunar rocks to fuel our reusable landers, extracting water from permanently shadowed craters on the south pole, and developing a new generation of nuclear-powered spacecraft that will actually help us fly further and farther and faster than ever before. Now, accomplishing these ambitious goals will require creativity, professionalism, energy. It'll also require technologies that were once considered science fiction. But here at NASA Ames, you've done it for decades: You make ""science fiction"" into ""scientific fact,"" and you make history at NASA Ames. (Applause.) And we're going to do it again. Really. I mean, the brilliant minds here at this historic institution led three of the last five NASA lunar science missions, expanding our understanding of the Moon and the incredible potential that it holds. And Ames was vital to the success of the LCROSS mission a decade ago , AUDIENCE MEMBER: Woo! THE PRESIDENT: , confirming the existence , yeah, you can give yourselves a round of applause. That was a big deal. Confirming the existence of ice on the south pole of the Moon. And NASA Ames was there to make it happen. (Applause.) It's a big deal. And as I mentioned before, in 2022, we'll once again step up to lead with the VIPER mission, we'll map , we'll map that water before our crewed missions arrive. We'll be able to take full advantage of it as we send American astronauts to the south pole. And just three weeks ago, NASA Ames, in partnership, I'm told, with Google and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, achieved quantum supremacy. (Applause.) Wow. An incredible feat of computing power that, really, is going to change how we design our spacecraft, operate outside our atmosphere, and conduct missions to the Moon, and Mars, and beyond. And it all happened here. It all happened here at NASA Ames. Ames is proof that in today's age, the public and private sectors can achieve far more together than we ever have apart. And you just proved that in that effort. Not only are all of you here forging the technologies of the future, but the American companies that you work with are on the cutting edge of the space industry, developing the tools and instruments that help us unlock the mysteries of the universe as we journey further into space than ever before. And you all are playing a critical role today, and you're going to continue to play that role in bringing together the best minds in America, once again coming here to NASA Ames to make it happen. And I'm proud to report that, thanks to the President's leadership, we've taken action to unleash that private sector as never before. The President puts it pretty succinctly. He says, ""Rich guys love rockets,"" so we're going to let them build them and innovate with all the people here at NASA Ames. (Applause.) And we've been doing it. And the National Space Council has offered the President changes to where we've been streamlining the licensing regimes that oversee commercial launch, re-entry, remote sensing operations. We've been removing outdated regulations that increase costs and stifle innovation. You know, I remember hearing in one of our National Space Council meetings that you , you actually had a completely separate launch permitting process, depending on which launch facility that you went heavenward from. It's incredible to think about it, when we streamline all of that. And we've encouraged a more stable space environment by developing the world's first comprehensive space traffic management system. And today, NASA is leading commercial-friendly efforts to plan the orbital platforms that will replace the International Space Station, as well as the lunar landers that will carry us back to the Moon. And I really want to commend each and every one of you for the way that NASA and the way that NASA Ames are engaging the private sector to bring the best of America back to space. (Applause.) Keep it up. I mean, the truth of the matter is that, under this administration, America is open for business to all space enterprises. And we're going to work in ways that will facilitate capital formation and investment and creativity. But NASA Ames will be playing a critical role in partnership, as you do all the way through today. Already, I'm told, in the first half of this year, we've seen almost as much invested in space companies as we did in the entire year before. In fact, in the last decade , get this , nearly $25 billion has been invested in nearly 500 different space companies. And I'm especially proud to say that the majority of those investments have been in American businesses and America's private space enterprise. (Applause.) America is leading. So thanks again for allowing me to join you today. I'm truly humbled to be with you and to Dr. Eugene Tu and all the great folks here. Thank you for , thanks for letting me get in that simulator. (Laughter.) That was about the coolest thing I've done in a long time. And all kidding aside, thanks for all you do for the country. It's amazing to think about the contributions that NASA Ames has made, not just to American leadership in space, but to our quality of life. I mean, it's , it's been the collective IQs and professionalism and determination of the incredible men and women of NASA Ames that's been driving American leadership not just in space, but all over this nation for decades. And I know you'll continue to do it. But when it comes to space, you know, President Trump probably put it best. He said, ""It is America's destiny to be the leader amongst nations [in] our adventure into the great unknown."" And we believe it. I mean, Americans are explorers. In our hearts, we're always pushing the outer boundaries. And that's always been the culture here at NASA Ames. And my challenge to each of you is, it needs to continue to be. We know , we know there will be challenges ahead. There will be what will seem to be insurmountable barriers. There will be problems that you'll have to science your way out of, just the way NASA Ames does all the time. We also know that there will be courageous men and women who strap on a spacesuit, climb into a capsule, and fly into the vast unknown. It'll involve hazard and hardship and sacrifice and determination. And I know that care with which you do your work here at NASA Ames will always be born of your deep admiration for those with courage enough to go. And we will give them the best equipment and the best technology to lead America into the vast unknown. We know that there were three courageous space pioneers we celebrated a lot this year when, 50 years ago, they made their way to the Moon. Just about a week ago, I planted a Moon tree , you might even know what that is , at the Vice President's Residence, and Buzz Aldrin was standing right next me, and Neil Armstrong's son, Rick, was there as well. It was a very special day. But, you know, we reflected many times, at many of the 50th anniversary celebrations, something that Buzz and Neil's son made a point to tell me , and that was that there were three of them that went, two of them that walked on the Moon, but they always thought the real heroes were 400,000 hardworking engineers, mathematicians, and innovators who made the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure in human history happen. We celebrated 50 years of Apollo 11; we were celebrating all of you, as well. But well done. (Applause.) It's true. And they did , I was never at an occasion where Buzz Aldrin and Neil's family didn't stop me and say, ""No, no. It was 400,000 people that made it happen."" And NASA Ames was a big part of it. I mean, you prove here at NASA Ames that America can and will again accomplish anything we set our mind to. Because we know we stand on the shoulders of giants, and you do here at Ames. We carry with us a legacy of American innovators and heroes who have stepped up to serve in this space program at every level. And even now, our new heroes are being forged. And they give us courage and they inspire us to dream bigger, to work harder, to reach even greater heights, and to strive for even greater triumphs. And I know you'll continue to inspire the nation. The men and women here at NASA Ames uphold this proud legacy each and every day. In the years ahead, I want you to get ready because you're going to write , you're going to write your chapter here at NASA Ames. You're going to write a new chapter of American history and, frankly, of human history and leadership in space. So on behalf of President of the United States, let me again thank you for all of your hard work, your dedication, and your service to the country. And leaving here today, I leave with renewed confidence, not just by seeing this impressive facility, but by seeing the determination and resolve and optimism on all of your faces and the faces of everyone I've met here today. I leave here with confidence and with faith. Faith in all of you here at NASA Ames and everyone involved in America's space enterprise who will continue to build the tools and technologies to forge a new and brighter future in space than we could ever imagine. Faith in the extraordinary courage of this new generation of heroes that are, even now, training for those missions and the technology and the equipment and the methods that you're developing here at NASA Ames to move the boundary lines of human knowledge farther than ever before. And, lastly, I leave here with faith that, as generations of Americans have long believed, as the proverb wrote, that if we rise on the wings of the dawn, if we settle on the far side of the sea, even if we go up to the heavens, even there His hand will guide us, and His right hand will hold us fast. And let it be so for all of the men and women who will forge America's new future in space. So thank you, NASA Ames. Thank you for your work yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Let's get back to work. (Applause.) God bless you. END 1:05 P.M.

VSMP2011201939	Mike Pence	2019-11-20	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Fincantieri Marinette Marine	speech	"12:47 P.M. CST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) Thank you all for that warm welcome. And join me in thanking our brand-new Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia. He is fighting for American workers and American jobs every day. (Applause.) It really is great to be with all of you today and with some great public servants, especially my great friend, a great ally of this administration, Congressman Mike Gallagher. Thank you for your leadership and for your service to this country. (Applause.) But to Mayor Steve Genisot, and especially Dario Deste, Jan Allman, and standing here, before the bow of the future USS Marinette, it is great to be here with all the extraordinary men and women who have been the heart of this city since 1944. Let's hear it for the Marinette Marine team. (Applause.) Wow. I got to tell you, I got a chance to walk on that ship a few minutes ago, and the handiwork, the craftsmanship that's already been at sea for generations across America that's been produced in this shipyard is truly extraordinary. And it really is an honor to be with all of you. It's also an honor to be here with so many other hardworking Americans , people from across this state, neighbors, and friends. We just had a warm welcome as we drove through town. The entire school at Garfield Elementary came out on the curb, and I just had to pull over. (Applause.) It was great. And I do appreciate the warm welcome. I even got a letter when we had to reschedule this event. I got a letter from a fourth-generation business owner in this community. She looked , one look at me, and she knew that I liked cheese. So join me in thanking Carol Cubalchini, of Joe's Cheese House. Carol, I'm counting on you. (Applause.) She did , (laughs) , sent me a letter and said, ""I'm going to bring you some cheese."" So, Carol, thank you so much. And congratulations on all your family's success for so long. It is great, great to be here. And it is great to be back in the Badger State. It really is. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. When I told him yesterday that I was headed to Wisconsin, I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Applause.) So let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Wisconsin and is fighting every day to keep the promises that he made to the Badger State. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) It really is a privilege. It's a privilege for this Midwesterner to be back in the Heartland of America, but also to be here , to be here, on the President's behalf, with a company that's creating so many opportunities for generations now , not only for people in this city, but in Wisconsin, but really all across , all across this region. It's remarkable to think that Fincantieri's investment here in Marinette started with just a handful of workers and a contract to build five wooden barges for the United States Navy during World War Two. It's amazing. But since then, because of the skill and craftsmanship of the people of this community, the Marinette Marine has designed and built more than 1,500 naval vessels, and they're some of the finest ships at sea in the world. (Applause.) Wow. And as a result of your professionalism and the reputation of this great company, you've doubled your workforce in just the last decade, and created more than 200 good-paying American jobs just this year. And, today, Fincantieri Marinette Marine has created a total of more than 1,500 good-paying American jobs. And I got a bit of an announcement I learned on the way here: If there's any Wisconsinites, or even Michiganders, that are out there looking for work, Fincantieri is hiring right here in Marinette. (Applause.) That work? This is a growing economy, and a growing state, and a growing nation. And it's remarkable to think , remarkable to think that it's only going to continue. And because I'm told that FMM is planning another $100 million investment right here in Marinette, I think that's worth a round of applause. (Applause.) Creating 700 new jobs right here in the heart of the Heartland. Wow. And, you know, you're not just creating jobs in Marinette. You're also supporting thousands of jobs throughout the supply chain of this company. And as this company proudly says, your ships are not only made in Wisconsin by American workers, but they're made with American steel. (Applause.) Ninety-seven percent. I checked. Ninety-seven percent of all of the steel and aluminum that's used here is made in the USA. And I've got to tell you, that is music to my ears and I know it'll be music to the ears of the President when we're catching up later today. And you're not just supporting American manufacturing. I'm especially grateful for the role that all of you play in the first priority of our national government. FMM has played a critical role in the national defense of the United States of America for generations. (Applause.) And your handiwork here makes it possible for our Navy to sail the Seven Seas and defend this nation and stand with our allies. You've been supporting our men and women in uniform, but you're also doing it here at home. I'm actually told that this shipyard alone employs more than 100 men and women who have served in the uniform of the United States. Would all of the veterans who are with us today just raise your hand and give us one more chance to say ""thank you for your service""? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you for your service. And I've got to think , I've got to think those that served in uniform feel like you're still serving, because what you do here and what you build here is all a vital part of our ability to defend this nation. And since that very first contract, a one day , on day one, 77 years ago, Fincantieri has worked with our armed forces, I'm told, to make ships like icebreakers, mine countermeasure vessers [sic] , vessels, ocean tugboats, and, as I just walked around, the littoral combat ships , the LCS , made right here in Marinette, Wisconsin. You all ought to be proud. That's an incredible ship. And I was actually told that you even got a little bit of an Indiana connection there , that, in fact, I'm told, that the littoral ship, USS Indianapolis, was commissioned last month back in the Hoosier State. So thanks for building the Indianapolis right here in Marinette. (Applause.) So on behalf of our Commander-in-Chief, thank you for your contributions not just to this community, to this state, to our growing economy, and of course, to your families, but thank you for your contributions to the defense of this nation every day. But I'm also here because we've got a great opportunity before us. For all that's happening across this country, we've made incredible progress. I mean, when you think about the leadership that President Donald Trump has brought across this nation, I think there is only one way you can describe the last three years: It's been three years of action. It's been three years of results. It's been three years of promises made and promises kept. But we're just getting started, Marinette. We're going to keep growing strong. (Applause.) I mean, think about it , think about it. I mean, this President promised to rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy, and after years of reckless budget cutbacks that I'm sure you've felt here in this community, President Donald Trump delivered. This President has actually already signed, twice, the largest increases in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the largest pay raise for our men and women in uniform in more than 10 years. (Applause.) As the President likes to say, ""Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, [and] most technologically-advanced fighting force in the history of the world."" And we reminded the world of that just a few short weeks ago , didn't we? , when the United States Special Forces descended on a compound in north Syria and took out the leader of ISIS without one American casualty. (Applause.) How about that? How about that? And you'll be glad to know, earlier this year, the President also proposed what will be, by far, the largest defense budget in American history: $750 billion to make the strongest fighting force in the history of the world stronger still. It would fund an end strength of more than 2 million active and reserve military personnel. The President's budget would also modernize our armored brigade teams; provide resources for 12 battle force ships, 2 large unmanned surface ships, 110 fighter aircraft. And the budget also includes the largest shipbuilding budget request for the United States Navy in 20 years. (Applause.) In fact, as we stand here at the only shipyard on the Great Lakes that builds ships for the United States Navy, I'm proud to report to all of you that we are well on our way to the 350-ship navy that President Trump promised to the American people. (Applause.) And you're going to build a lot of it right here in Marinette. In fact, we're nearly at 300 ships and growing right now. And thanks in large part to all of you, the Navy soon is going to have, I'm told, 35 of those LCS ships like the one just behind me. So keep up the great work and keep delivering, and know that as you put your hands on these ships, you're really , you're really crafting the means for America's finest to defend this nation. And I know you'll continue to do it with the care and the concern and the dedication that the people of FMM have delivered for generations. The truth is, we've made great progress in strengthening our national defense over the last three years. But the people of Wisconsin deserve to know that things are getting a little tied up in Washington these days. While Democrats in Congress continue to spend all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment, they haven't been able to find time to fund our national defense or give us the increases that President Trump knows that we need. It's really incredible. For everything that's happening in Washington, D.C., the disgrace is also what's not happening in Washington, D.C. Did you know Congress just delayed, again, a $20 billion increase in our national defense? And because they failed to pass a defense bill this week, they had to pass a resolution , they had to pass a resolution that would , that would make the Department of Defense delay new acquisition programs this year and potentially force the Navy to sideline 14 ships that need repairs. Now, there's real consequences to what's going on in Washington, D.C. While they continue their politics as usual, it's having a real impact on the life of the nation and our national defense. Well, I think the American people deserve better. And it's time for Congress to put politics aside, do their job, and fund our national defense at the level that the American people deserve. (Applause.) And I'll make you a promise: Whatever Democrats in Congress want to spend their time on, President Trump and I are going to keep fighting, and we're going to keep on delivering. With all of your help and skill, we're going to keep on giving our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, our Marines, and our Coast Guard the resources and the equipment they need to accomplish their mission and defend this nation, so help us God. (Applause.) So we've rebuilt our military. You all have played a key role in that, but you're also part of an incredible economic success story. This President not only said we could restore the arsenal of democracy, stand tall in the world again, stand with our allies, stand up to our enemies, but he also said we could revive the American economy. When he and I were campaigning across Wisconsin three years ago, this economy hadn't grown by more than 2 percent for the last eight years. And people were saying that was the new normal. But President Donald Trump knew better, and President Donald Trump delivered. Right out of the gate, in our first year, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses just like this one. We rolled back more federal red tape in this administration than any administration in American history. We've unleashed American energy. We're now going to be a net exporter of oil and natural gas for the first time in 75 years. And we fought for free and fair trade that puts American jobs and American workers first. (Applause.) And the results , been doing it. And the results have been remarkable. Not like I got to tell any of you. I mean, since Election Day, businesses large and small , just like this one , have been growing all across this country. 6.7 million new jobs have been created across America, including 100,000 jobs in Wisconsin and Michigan alone. I mean, it's incredible. I remember the last administration , we had a President in the White House who was asked what he was going to do to bring back manufacturing. Now, I'm a little bit biased here. You know, I come from a state just like Wisconsin, where we , we do two things especially well: We make things and we grow things. Right? And we actually had a President, in the summer of 2016, who said that manufacturing jobs , 200,000 jobs that have been lost , would never be coming back. Do you remember? He was actually asked what he was going to do to bring manufacturing back, and he said , he says, ""What do you have? A magic wand?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs are back and roaring. (Applause.) I'm telling you, it's coming back, including 5,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs right here in Wisconsin. But it's not just been about manufacturing. And overall, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. Here in Wisconsin, it's just 3.3 percent. In fact, right now, the unemployment rate is below 5 percent in 48 states in this country. And as I stand before you today, nine states , nine states across this country have the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded. And in just the last few months, the unemployment rate for women hit a 65-year low, and the unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded. The American Dream is working for everybody, and every American should be proud. (Applause.) It's true. And, you know, it's not just been about more jobs; it's been about better jobs. I mean, since President Trump was elected, the average American household has seen your disposable income go up by $5,000 a year. Under the last administration, the average American household lost $3,000 a year in income. I mean, you all felt it, and you're seeing how it's all , how it's all improving. And wages have been going up. They're going up faster than they have in more than 10 years. And they're rising most rapidly , the President and I couldn't be more proud , wages, today, are rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. (Applause.) Okay? And people know it. You all know it. You see it at this great company. I hear about it all over the country. Karen and I slipped away for a long day-and-a-half vacation about a few months ago. We went down to Sanibel Island, Florida. You ever heard of it? It's right over there near Fort Myers. It's a great place. But we were sitting out there on the beach , true story , had our ball caps on, our sunglasses, reading a book, trying to catch a little bit of time off. And these two big boys came walking by, both wearing Budweiser shirts. Men after my own heart. (Laughter.) And they did , one of them stopped and looked at me , because the local newspaper had said that we were on the island. And one of them stopped and looked at me and he said, ""You're Pence, aren't you?"" And I said, ""Yes, sir. I am."" And he said, ""Well, listen, next time you see the President"" , he said, ""You tell him to keep doing what he's doing because I made twice as much money last year as I made the year before."" And I said, ""You know, what? I'm going to tell him that word for word."" And I did. And then he took two steps away and turned back around and he said, ""And I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing too."" (Laughter.) And I told him I would. (Applause.) It's true. People know it. You know it. You feel the energy in this place. You see a company growing. You see a community thriving. And it's all happening. It's all happening for two reasons. Number one, because you got a President who understands. You got our entire administration and great allies in Congress that understand what makes the most powerful free-market economy in the history of the world work: less taxes, less regulation, more low-cost American energy, better and fairer trade deals. And we've been fighting for them every day. But the truth of the matter is, the President and I also know the other half of the reason that America is prospering is because, frankly, the working men and women of America are the hardest-working people in the world. (Applause.) It's true. I mean, nobody can outwork us, right? Nobody can outwork the American worker. And it's people like all of you gathered here that I'm , that's why I'm really particularly excited to be here. People, I'm told, like a lead shipbuilder here at Marinette. I'm told he started here as a welder more than 40 years ago. He later became an electrician. His son, Pat, followed in his footsteps and joined the company, like , like so many others that I've already met today. And, now, this father and son are working side by side on the LCS Minneapolis-Saint Paul. It's a great family effort, contributing to this community, contributing to the defense of this nation. So would you join me in showing gratitude and appreciation for 44 years of service to Joseph Klaver? Where are you, Joe. (Applause.) Where's your son? Right next to you? Give him a round of applause, too. (Applause.) Thanks, Joe. Great. What a great team. Great family. Or, I'm told, the former Marinette chief of police is also in our midst. He wore the badge for 30 years before joining this company as your security manager. And when he did, he joined nearly a dozen of his family members who were already here: welders, electricians, a company spokeswoman. It really was already a family affair. But he brought his leadership skills, his background, his experience, to come here and make sure that all that you create here is properly secured and protected. In fact, I'm told one of his daughters actually met her husband here. That's what we call a ""bonus."" (Laughter.) And they've now been married for five years, and they got a three-year-old son named Pierce. So join me in thanking Jeff Skorik and the entire Skorik family for their service to this community, this company, and this nation. Where are you? (Applause.) Thanks, Jeff. That is really awesome. But, really, the Klavers, the Skoriks, and the Kowalskis, and all the other families that are represented here are just emblematic of all of you. The truth is, what you've proved in this company is that, when we level the playing field, when we allow American businesses and American workers to compete, that we can compete and win against any workers anywhere in the world. So give yourselves a round of applause, Marinette Marine. You're proving it every day. (Applause.) So I'm happy to report to all of you about the promises kept by this President and this administration. But I want you all to know that we recognize that it's thanks to all of you and that leadership, and the support we've had from our allies in Congress, that this country is prospering like never before. And this President, I promise you, is committed to ensuring this prosperity reaches every American home. But to do that, we need to match the right jobs with the right workers and the skills. And this company is also leading in that as well. It's remarkable to think that, for more than a year and a half, there have been more job openings in America than there are Americans looking for work. I mean, in fact, there are one million more job openings than there are unemployed Americans. It's extraordinary. So, workers in the skilled trades, like so many of you here, are in high demand. It's true. And that demand is only going to continue to grow as this economy is revived and is growing stronger by the day. Workers with your unique abilities and skills are going to be necessary to drive a growing American economy. And the truth is, closing what the experts call the ""skills gap"" has to be job one. And I promise you that you have a President and a Vice President who believes that all honest work is honorable. And we are working every single day to expand vocational education and vocational training for every American. (Applause.) I mean, we want to make sure , we want to make sure that every American has access to the education that they want to follow their dreams. When I was governor of the state of Indiana, I was reflecting on the fact that back when I was coming out of high school in the 1970s, things were different. I'm sure they were in Wisconsin, too. Right? I mean, there's some people here with hair the same color as mine, right? I mean, when I went to high school, there wasn't , I mean, we all came into the school the same way. Some of us would turn left and go down to study AP English. Some of us would turn right and go down to Industrial Arts. We ate in the same cafeteria. We cheered for the same team. We walked across the same stage on Graduation Day. All right? I mean, but somewhere along the way , it's true isn't it? , our high schools got out of the business of offering education and training for every American, on every pathway. And I don't have to tell the people here at FMM what good-paying jobs and great careers there are in manufacturing. And that's why this President has taken decisive action to make vocational education and job training more accessible than ever before. In our first year, the President expanded apprenticeships and vocational training to help every American adapt to this changing and growing economy. And last year, we launched, with the help of even this company, something called the ""Pledge to America's Workers"" to encourage businesses in every field to expand opportunities for training for American workers and American jobs. By signing the pledge, like this company did, companies committed to create training opportunities over the next five years for students, for workers , either through apprenticeship, continuing education, or on-the-job training. Now, when the , I'm , this , I'm really excited to tell you this: When the Pledge for America's Workers was launched, our first-year goal was 500,000 training opportunities and apprenticeships. But I've got to be honest with you, we didn't , we didn't hit that number. As I stand before you today, more than 370 companies have pledged almost 15 million training opportunities and apprenticeships for American workers. (Applause.) That's called under-promising and over-delivering. And we're really just getting started. I mean , and I , would you just give the great team here , your CEO, Jan , give them all , Fincantieri , FMM has committed to 3,000 apprenticeships and job-training posts right here in this company. Thank you so very much. (Applause.) Thank you, Jan. So I want to thank Dario, and Jan, and all of you for this incredible commitment to Wisconsin and to Michigan, and for leading by example. The truth is, you know, there are people maybe looking on right now. I mean, there , the literally tens of Americans that might be watching this on C-SPAN , (laughter) , might be excited to hear, ""You know what? I can go up to Wisconsin and there's companies up there that are ready to help me get the training so I can work on one of these and I can be a part of something really important, not just for my family and for my community, but for my nation."" And those training opportunities , we're going to have even more people that can fill the jobs in this growing economy here in Wisconsin, and we'll more competitive on the world stage, as well. I mean, the truth is, under the President's leadership, American workers are competing and winning with workers all over the world. And President Trump promised to work on making sure our economy had the conditions where companies and workers could grow and prosper. But this President, as I mentioned, also promised to fight for trade deals that are free, and fair, and reciprocal. And President Donald Trump has delivered. We negotiated a new trade deal with South Korea. He signed two new trade agreements with Japan, and we're working toward a free trade agreement with them. And President Trump put China on notice. He said, ""The era of economic surrender is over."" And China is at the negotiating table as we speak. (Applause.) So, we've done a lot. We're working on more. When the UK finishes Brexit, we're going to work with them. We're even talking to the European Union about a deal. But closer to home, there's a deal that's done that I wanted to ask for your help on before I slip away and catch a plane back to Indiana. I don't know if you all know this, but President Trump , and when he campaigned through Wisconsin , said that we could do better than NAFTA. You know, from the time NAFTA was signed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton, we literally saw tens of thousands of factories close in this country and jobs open south of the border. President Trump said we can do better. We, right out of the gate, started into negotiations with our neighbors in Mexico and in Canada. And I'm going to tell you: President Trump drove a hard bargain. The man that wrote ""The Art of the Deal,"" one year ago, closed the deal. And the USMCA is a win for Wisconsin workers and American jobs, I promise you. (Applause.) And it's not just manufacturing. I don't have to tell you up here in Wisconsin about dairy. I mean, there was a lot , you can go ask your friends that work in dairy around here. There's a lot going on up in Canada that was really working against the vitality of our dairy industry here in the upper northwest. President Trump stood strong with Prime Minister Trudeau, held firm, and we delivered. We delivered for dairy. We delivered a win for American agriculture. Now, it's all good news; the USMCA has been done for a year. But, again, one more example of something Congress apparently hasn't had time to get to in the midst of everything else they're doing. The truth is, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had the USMCA on her desk for a year. She continues to say they're on a path to ""yes,"" but the truth is Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor. Because I , the truth is, if they bring it to the floor of the Congress, it's going to pass, and it's going to be a win for Wisconsin and a win for American workers. And I came here today to say the time has come for Democrats in Congress to put politics aside, put America first, and pass the USMCA. (Applause.) Okay? It's going to make a difference in Wisconsin and all across this country. According to the ITC, this Mexico-Canada Agreement that we negotiated a year ago is going to add about $70 billion to our economy and create more than 175,000 jobs, including 50,000 manufacturing jobs. And when it becomes law, we predict that American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, as wages will continue to increase as exports expand. In fact, for Wisconsin: If the USMCA becomes law, the United States would increase its exports of milk and cheese by 68,000 tons. So we need to get this done. But the last thing I just want to mention to you is I wanted to ask for your help to get it done. Because the truth is, the clock is ticking. We all know there's a big presidential election coming next year, and if you think Congress has a hard time getting anything done when it's not an election year, just wait for an election year to come. So the time has come for Congress to act. And I want to encourage you, here in Wisconsin, to reach out to your members of Congress. But let me save you a nickel: You don't need to call Senator Ron Johnson because he's leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate. (Applause.) Thank you, Senator Johnson. And you also , you also don't need to , you don't need to call one of the rising stars in the Republican Congress , a seventh-generation Wisconsinite, grew up in a small-business family, die-hard Packers fan , kind of goes without saying. But I'm so inspired, as the father of a United States Marine , he was a captain in the United States Marine Corps, deployed twice for this country, and he is fighting for jobs here in Marinette and leading the charge. Join me in thanking Congressman Mike Gallagher, will you? (Applause.) He's an incredible American. Thank you, Mike. In fact, you don't need to call the Republican members of Congress from Wisconsin because they're all in there, standing with the President every single day on the USMCA and everything else. But, if you get a minute, you might just call Senator Tammy Baldwin, and you might call Congressman Ron Kind. Tell them, ""I ran into Mike the other day"" , (laughter) , ""at Marinette Marine, and he told me that this USMCA has been on the Speaker of the House's desk for a year."" And tell them, ""Wisconsin and America need the USMCA and we need it this year."" You call them. (Applause.) It will make a difference. You know, I was a member of Congress for 12 years before I served as governor of the Hoosier State. And I can tell you, there's nothing more powerful in Washington, D.C., than the voice of the American people. And the USMCA is going to be a win for every American. So let your voice be heard. So, thanks for coming out today. Thanks for the warm welcome. I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits. In the days and weeks that lie ahead, I'll make you a promise: Whatever Democrats want to spend their time on on Capitol Hill, President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting. We're never going to stop fighting to keep the promises that we made to the people of Wisconsin. We're never going to stop delivering on a strong national defense, secure borders, conservatives to our courts at every level, and we're never going to stop fighting for jobs, jobs, jobs in Wisconsin and across America. (Applause.) We're counting on it. I mean, the , sometimes people come up to me and say a very unnecessary thing. They'll say, ""Tell the President to just , to keep going."" Let me tell you, that's something you never have to say to President Donald Trump. I mean, as we say in the Hoosier State, ""All that reverse is stripped out of that pickup truck. It only goes forward."" And we're going to keep fighting to keep Wisconsin and America going strong. (Applause.) So thank you again. I leave here today with this warm welcome from so many great Americans. I leave here today with renewed confidence and faith. Faith in this President that I serve with every day, that he's just going to keep on fighting every day , keep the promises that he made to people of this state for a stronger, more prosperous America. When I come to a company like this, my , it also renews my faith in the people of this country, in the businesses and the hardworking Americans that are driving this era of unprecedented prosperity and growth. And lastly, I can assure you I , I get up every day and I renew that other kind of faith in my life as well. Faith in Him who said, I'll ""never leave you and never forsake you,"" who was here when this great state was carved out of this dense wilderness, and is still with us today. With faith in Him, I know the best days for Wisconsin and America are yet to come. So thank you so very much. Thanks for the warm welcome. (Applause.)

VSMP81202038	Mike Pence	2020-01-08	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Reception in Honor of the Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic	speech	"VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Would you join me in thanking the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, for he and his wife's wonderful hospitality here at the State Department? (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. Secretary. To Mr. Prime Minister Mitsotakis; your wonderful bride; distinguished members of Congress who are joining us here today; to Ambassador Haris Lalakos; and most especially, on behalf of my wife Karen and I, who have come to love the Greek American community: Welcome to all the great Greek Americans who join us here tonight. (Applause.) But Prime Minister Mitsotakis, it is a great honor to be a part of America's welcome, welcoming you back to the United States to celebrate the unbreakable bonds between our country , bonds that have been forged in history and heritage, bonds built on a shared love of freedom, and bonds built between families , Greek families that came to this country and, from the very founding of this nation, have contributed immeasurably to the life of this nation and still represent the core of what binds us together. As the Secretary just reflected, as the President reflected in the Oval Office with you today, I am proud to report firsthand that, thanks to your leadership and the leadership of President Donald Trump, the bonds between the United States of America and Greece have never been stronger. (Applause.) Last year alone, our two nations engaged in nearly $3 billion in trade. But it's not economic exchange that defines us. It's really a shared philosophy of government. I saw the energy between you and President Trump yesterday in the Oval Office. I saw the friendship between you. And I also saw the common purpose, as Secretary Pompeo just reflected, in President Trump and in you, Prime Minister Mitsotakis. They are two leaders who believe that when you let people keep more of what they earn, when you roll back red tape, when you make government more efficient and you drive low-cost energy, making it available to job creators, economies proposer. And America and Greece are prospering thanks to your leadership and the leadership of President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Our economy is booming. Unemployment in the United States is at a 50-year low. More Americans are working than ever before. And under your leadership, at a time of slow growth around the world, the unemployment rate in Greece is at its lowest level in more than eight years. And we congratulate you, Mr. Prime Minister. (Applause.) I can't help but reflect, in this historic building, about the ties that have always bound our two nations. The Founding Fathers of our country recognized that Americans would be heirs of the achievements of Greek civilization. We would carry the ideals , the love for freedom and democracy , here. It was on a hill in Athens that the world's first democratic assemblies were gathered more than 2,500 years ago. And while the Secretary talked about his vacation travels last fall , (laughter) , I can tell you that, before I got this job, Mrs. Pence and I traveled to Athens, spent some time on the Acropolis, and had a lot less company than I have these days. (Laughter.) But we loved being in Greece, and I look forward to the day that I am able to return. (Applause.) t's amazing , from that historic past, so carefully cherished and preserved by the Greek people , that, two millennia later, a tiny alliance of people on a distant coast rose up against the world's strongest empire. To no less extent, they were inspired by the way the Greek people had led a small alliance of cities to stand up for freedom against impossible odds on the plains of Marathon and at the narrow pass of Thermopylae. They spoke of it. They wrote about it. Our Founding Fathers cherished it. Thomas Jefferson would say, ""To the ancient Greeks, we are all indebted for the light which led [us] out of darkness."" (Applause.) And, in 1821, when it came time for Greeks to fight for their independence against the odds once again, they inspired a freedom-loving people around the world, including here in America. It's no small wonder that a great champion of human freedom , my second-favorite President, Ronald Reagan , (applause) , began the tradition of celebrating Greek Independence Day in the White House. And I'm proud to say that President Donald Trump has continued that tradition for the past three years, and so we always shall. (Applause.) Our nations share an incredible history. But it really is obvious to me, particularly being in the Oval Office yesterday, seeing the connection between you and President Trump , two energetic leaders with a conviction and a belief in freedom, and a drive to be able to put it into practice to improve people's lives , that the best is yet to come. So, on behalf of the American people, in celebration of the economic partnerships, the military partnerships, and the deep heritage between our two nations, allow me to join with all of you to raise a glass. Raise a glass , PRIME MINISTER MITSOTAKIS: I'll grab the ouzo, now. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Yeah. I wondered what that was. Let me raise a glass , (laughter) , to , (laughs) , now I know your preference. (Laughter.) Raise a glass to Prime Minister Mitsotakis, to his wonderful wife, to the people of Greece, to Greek Americans, and to the enduring friendship between the United States of America and Greece. Yamas. (Applause.) (A toast is offered.) And now, would you all join me in welcoming Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to the United States of America and the Department of State? (Applause.) END 6:30 P.M.

VSMP231202037	Mike Pence	2020-01-23	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Fifth World Holocaust Forum | Jerusalem, Israel	speech	"3:24 P.M. IST VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: President Rivlin, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Your Majesties, Presidents, Excellencies, honored survivors and distinguished guests: It is deeply humbling for me to stand before you today, on behalf of the American people, as we mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. On this occasion, here on Mount Herzl, we gather to fulfill a solemn obligation , an obligation of remembrance: to never allow the memory of those who died in the Holocaust to be forgotten by anyone, anywhere in the world. The word ""remember"" appears no fewer than 169 times in the Hebrew Bible , for memory is the constant obligation of all generations. And today we pause to remember what President Donald Trump rightly called the ""dark stain on human history"" , the greatest evil ever perpetuated by man against man in the long catalogue of human crime. The faces of a million and a half children reduced to smoke under a silent sky for the crime of having a single Jewish grandparent. The night Elie Wiesel called ""seven times sealed"" consumed the faith of so many then, and challenges the faith of so many still. Today we remember what happens when the powerless cry for help and the powerful refuse to answer. The town's name was Oświęcim. As part of their plan to destroy the very existence of Polish culture, the Nazis gave Polish towns German names. And this one they called Auschwitz. When soldiers opened the gates of Auschwitz on January 27, 1945, they found 7,000 half-starved, half-naked prisoners, hundreds of boxes of camp records that documented the greatest mass murder in history. Before the war was over, in its five years of existence, more than 1.1 million men, women, and children would perish at Auschwitz. As my wife and I can attest firsthand, from this past year, one cannot walk the grounds of Auschwitz without being overcome with emotion and grief. One cannot see the piles of shoes, the gas chambers, the crematoriums, the lone boxcar facing the gate to the camp, and those grainy photographs of men, women, and children being sent to their deaths without asking: ""How could they?"" Today we mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve. We remember the names and the faces and the promise of the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Today we also pay tribute to those who survived, who all these years have borne witness to that evil and have served mankind by their example. (Applause.) And today we honor and remember the memory of all the Allied forces, including more than 2 million American soldiers, who left hearth and home, suffered appalling casualties, and freed a continent from the grip of tyranny. And, finally, we pay tribute to the memory of those non-Jewish heroes who saved countless lives , those the people of Israel call the ""righteous among the nations."" In an age of indifference, they acted. In an age of fear, they showed courage. And their memory and their example should kindle anew the flame of our hearts to do the same in our time. (Applause.) We must be prepared to stand as they did against the wave of their times. We must be prepared to confront and expose the vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fueling hate and violence all across the world. And we must stand together. (Applause.) In that same spirit, we must also stand strong against the leading state purveyor of anti-Semitism, against the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map. The world must stand strong against the Islamic Republic of Iran. (Applause.) And, finally, we must have the courage to recognize all the leaders and all the nations that are gathered here that, today, we have the responsibility and the power to ensure that what we remember here today can never happen again. (Applause.) Mr. Prime Minister, as we honor and remember the 6 million Jewish martyrs of the Holocaust, the world can only marvel at the faith and resilience of the Jewish people, who just three years after walking in the valley of the shadow of death, rose up from the ashes to reclaim a Jewish future and rebuild the Jewish State. (Applause.) And I'm proud to say, as Vice President of the United States, that the American people have been with you every step of the way since 1948. (Applause.) And so we will remain. As President Trump declared in his historic visit to Jerusalem, the bond between our two peoples is ""woven together in the fabric of our hearts."" And so it shall always be. (Applause.) Today we remember not simply the liberation of Auschwitz but also the triumph of freedom , a promise fulfilled, a people restored to their rightful place among the nations of the Earth. And we remember , we remember the long night of that past, the survivors and the faces of those we lost, the heroes who stood against those evil times. And today we gather nearly 50 nations strong, here in Jerusalem, to say with one voice: Never again. (Applause.) Through pogroms, persecutions, and expulsions in the ghettos, and finally, even through the death camps, the Jewish people clung to an ancient promise that He would ""never leave you or forsake you"" and that he would leave this people to inherit the land that he swore to your ancestors that he would give them. And so, today, as we bear witness to the strength and the resilience and the faith of the Jewish people, so too we bear witness to God's faithfulness to the Jewish people. (Applause.) May the memory of the martyrs be enshrined in the hearts of all humanity for all time. May God bless the Jewish people, the State of Israel, the United States, and all the nations gathered here. And may He who creates peace in the heavens create peace for us and for all the world. Oseh shalom bimromav. Hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu. V'al kol Yisrael V'imru. Amen. (Applause.) END 3:36 P.M.

VSMP271202036	Mike Pence	2020-01-27	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Lunar New Y ...	speech	Well, thank you all very much for that very warm welcome. And on behalf of the President of the United States and the First Family: Welcome to the White House. (Applause.) And join me in thanking an extraordinary leader. I just , as soon as I heard her voice, I had to jump out from behind the curtain. (Laughter.) She is not only the 18th Secretary of Transportation, but frankly, she is one of the most distinguished public servants in the United States of America, with an inspiring personal story. And she makes the American people and this administration proud every day. Join me in thanking Secretary Elaine Chao, will you? (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much, Elaine. I'm also joined today , I know they've already been introduced, but I just , I have to call them out. We're talking a lot about the economy and a lot about all the great things happening. And you all are such a big part of that in so many ways, so many places around the country. But President Trump and I are so grateful for the tremendous leadership of Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Wilbur, thank you so much and thank you for being here. (Applause.) And he's a new kid on the block , or the new kid on the Cabinet , but he's already hit the ground running, and he's making an incredible difference to make sure that the American people are prepared for this growing economy, we're able to have safe and productive workplaces, and to do it all in an atmosphere of freedom. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, thank you so much for being here. (Applause.) And I want to thank Chairman Mike Duncan, of the Postal Service, for the big announcement today; the Postal Service Board of Governors; and, of course, this initiative's executive director. Give Tina Smith a round of applause, as well as Michael. (Applause.) Thank you. Great job. It is a real privilege be here with all of you to just share for a few minutes during the Lunar New Year celebration, and to take this opportunity to swear in 13 extraordinary Americans as Commissioners of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. I was looking through the list of men and women that will take the oath today, and they represent some of the most accomplished Asian Americans in this country, and they will continue to guide the development of policies that will expand opportunities. And so we'll have them all up here in a minute, but give them a big round of applause right now, will you, please? Congratulations and thank you. (Applause.) And while we gather here and we celebrate the immense contributions of Asian Americans, I know the hearts of many who are gathered here and those that you represent across the United States are with , are with our , are with the Chinese families that are being impacted. Twenty-six different provinces enduring now the impact of the coronavirus. And at present, there have been over 60 deaths. At this hour, more than 3,000 have contracted the disease globally, including five confirmed cases in the United States of America. President Trump made it clear today that we are in close communication with China. And he has offered to President Xi the assistance of the United States of America. And we stand ready to help the people of China confront the coronavirus. (Applause.) And to my fellow Americans, I want to assure you that our administration has taken strong action to deal with this virus. The CDC is following an aggressive plan that will enable us to identify potential cases. So I mentioned there's five confirmed cases in the United States so far. We've , we're already conducting screening at 20 American airports, and they're the airports that receive 90 percent of all passengers from China. Any passengers who are ill will receive additional screening. The State Department has issued a level 4 travel advisory for Wuhan, which makes it clear that no American should travel to Wuhan while this virus continues to have impact. And so let me say once again, here in our country we're taking strong steps to see to the health and the wellbeing of the American people. But as President Trump made clear today, the United States of America stands ready , stands ready to assist the people of China and around the world as they deal with this virus. And you might make a note for anyone in your sphere of influence who would have questions: You can go to CDC.gov/Coronavirus for the latest information on the action of the United States. But the people of China are in the prayers of the American people. And we will stand with them, and we will take the actions necessary to protect the American people. (Applause.) So thank you for allowing me to address that. We gather here this afternoon and with , frankly, with people about the world in the midst of the Lunar New Year celebration. And it includes millions of Americans who will celebrate the Lunar New York, and that's a great privilege for me to be able to join you in this particular moment. And this year we've got a lot to celebrate. For one thing, how about the 2020 Lunar New York stamp? (Applause.) I thanked him already, but Mike Duncan and Luke Grossmann of the Postal Service, thank you. I guess this is a tradition of issuing a Lunar New Year stamp. It's a small tribute to the indispensable contributions that Asian Americans have played throughout the history of this country. And this year's stamp is one more emblematic example of us celebrating that tradition. And this year, I'm proud to report, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, as the Secretaries have no doubt already reflected, Asian Americans are prospering like never before, and the American economy is booming. (Applause.) In fact, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent are the fastest-growing group in America , growing by nearly three-quarters in just 15 years, and expected to double over the next 40 years. And, in fact, according to the Census Bureau, household income for Asian Americans is now 40 percent higher than the national average, and rising fast. (Applause.) The American economy is soaring, and Asian Americans are driving capital investment and growth and job creation in cities and towns, large and small, all across the land. Over the summer, I'm told that Asian American unemployment hit the lowest level ever recorded, and it's been under 3 percent for the better part of a year. It's an incredible record of success of the American Dream. And with the help of the commissioners that we will swear in today, I know the best is yet to come for Asian Americans and those of Pacific Island descent. You know, it's a remarkable group. I could literally go through the bios of all of the people that we'll swear in today, but they , you really come from literally every walk of life: small businesses owners , owners like Jan-le Low of Nevada; entrepreneurs like Grace Lee of Michigan; and public servants like Governor Eddie Calvo of Guam and Michelle Steel of California, just to name a few. You all represent extraordinary accomplishment in your own lives and your willingness to come together to participate in this important effort. And it's only going to make it more possible for more Asian Americans and those with Pacific Island backgrounds to be able to prosper and enjoy the American Dream. And so, with that, I want to say thank you and congratulations. Congratulations to all of those that , who will become commissioners today. And I want to thank you for serving your country. I want to thank you for giving back. Each one of you, in your own stories, has lived the American Dream, and you're living it now. And by your participation in the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, you demonstrate that you want to see more; you want to see more Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders live that very same dream for their betterment and the betterment of the United States of America. And so I thank you for your service. And God bless you. (Applause.) With that , with that, I'll ask all of the commissioners to join me on stage, and the secretaries will also stand. And they've got lots of tape up here, in case you don't know where you're supposed to stand. (Laughter.) (The oath is administered.)

VSMP142202035	Mike Pence	2020-02-14	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the National Association of Manufacturers Winter 2020 Board of Directors Meeting	speech	"Well, thank you all for the warm welcome. It is a great privilege to be with all of you today. To Michael Lamach, to Jim Fitterling, to all the members of the Board of Directors who are gathered here: I know you've had a busy week and, I know, a productive time together, but to stand before you today at the close of this conference and to have the opportunity to address some of the most significant business leaders in America is a great, great privilege for me. So, thank you. Thank you so much for your warm welcome. I also want to say thank you to Jay Timmons and this terrific staff at the National Association of Manufacturers. They make an incredible difference in the life of this nation, and you can give them a round of applause if they haven't gotten more than a few. (Applause.) It's also great , great to be here as you celebrate 125 years of the National Association of Manufacturers. I know I stand before you today and I'm looking into the eyes of some of the most extraordinary men and women in this country; that you are leaders who literally employ millions of Americans and create jobs and opportunities and make dreams come true every single day. And it's really great to be here among so many champions of free enterprise. Thanks to all of your efforts, to the investments your companies have made, and thanks to the leadership of a friend of mine, we're in the midst of a great American comeback, and manufacturing is leading the way! (Applause.) And it's always been true in this country. You know, I think in the long and storied history of America, we've done two things especially well: We make things and we grow things. And all of you in this association and the companies large and small that are represented here, for 120 years , 125 years, excuse me , have improved the lives of the American people. You've strengthened communities. But as I begin this morning, let me also say I'm very aware , from my years in the Congress growing up in a manufacturing state of Indiana, my years as governor , I know I'm standing in front of some of the most generous and conscientious corporate citizens in America. Your companies get behind literally every worthy cause in every big city and small town in America. So why don't you give yourselves a round of applause for what you and your employees do to improve the lives of the American people every day. (Applause.) We're truly grateful. It really is great to be with so many friends in the room. And as I begin, let me bring greetings from another friend of mine and a great champion of manufacturing, someone who spent a lifetime building, and now he is rebuilding the American Dream for countless Americans. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, from the day he took that historic ride down the escalator, President Trump promised the American people that he would be, in his words, ""a leader that [would] bring back our jobs and bring back manufacturing."" And President Donald Trump delivered and has been fighting to keep that promise every single day. (Applause.) And thanks to the President's leadership and the reforms that we'll reflect on today , were achieved with his leadership and with your support , it's remarkable to think that, since Election Day 2016, businesses just like all of yours have literally created more than 7 million new jobs across this country, including more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, the stock market has broken even more records this week, and more Americans are working today than ever before. It really is an incredible accomplishment. And the rise in the stock market is , you know, I watch the business television shows, probably not as much as you do, but I watch these business television shows and they're always talking about the ""curves this"" and ""the econometrics that,"" and all the fancy talk. But, you know, the bottom line is, when the 401(k)s are growing, when the stock market is rising, pensions are growing. And the truth is, the policies that the National Association of Manufacturers and all of you got behind have made a difference strengthening the foundation under working families and retirees across America. And on behalf of all of them, thank you for your support. You've improved the wellbeing and the future of millions of American families. (Applause.) And I also want to express appreciation that, in the midst of the reforms that we'll talk about today that you've been reflecting on all this week, after years of flat wages and, really , it was a stubborn metric when I was governor of the state of Indiana, in a heavy manufacturing state. We just could never get wages to rise outside of a very minimal level. Manufacturing has never been given to the rapid income increases that you see in some other sectors of the economy. But I'm proud to report today that wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Companies, like all of you around this room, are investing in your workers as you have not done for more than 10 years. And what's most exciting, as I travel all across country, and in South Carolina yesterday, is that wages are rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. American business is investing in working Americans again. Thank you for that. (Applause.) I mean, the truth of the matter is, the President said that we were going to focus our administration on the forgotten men and women of America. And all of you, by investing those resources in hardworking Americans, have done just that. The forgotten men and women are forgotten no more. And I'm here to tell you: They know it. And for the first time in 18 years, it's amazing to think there are actually more job openings in America than there are people looking for work. And it's been that way for nearly two years. In January alone, we saw companies like all those gathered here create some 225,000 new jobs. And as I stand before you today, there's not only 500,000 new manufacturing jobs under President Trump's leadership, but I'm told that there's another 360,000 manufacturing jobs waiting to be filled. This economy is working for manufacturing and it's working for working Americans. (Applause.) In fact , in fact, under the President's leadership, we've seen the best year for manufacturing job creation, Jay, in more than 20 years. It's really been a remarkable time. The most manufacturing job openings recorded in 18 years. The highest levels of optimism among manufacturers ever recorded. And thanks to the strong support of NAM and the leadership of this President, American manufacturing has come roaring back. It's remarkable to think about the difference over the last three years. I mean, the last President actually saw this country lose 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And I remember, out on the campaign trail, the last administration actually asked the question, ""What magic wand do you have?"" I mean, the assumption was manufacturing was never going to come back. I remember hearing that very same thing when I was leading the state of Indiana as governor. But you thought different. President Donald Trump thought different. We didn't need a magic wand; we just needed a leader in the White House who believed in manufacturing. We just needed President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. It's made the difference. (Applause.) And it didn't just happen. You all know, in our first year in office, the President went right to work to pass the policies that we had campaigned on that he knew, as a lifelong entrepreneur and business leader, would make it possible for companies like all of those gathered here to invest in ways to create jobs and bring manufacturing and all of American business back. The President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history in our first year. We cut taxes across the board for working families but also for businesses large and small. And I was in those negotiations. I remember the President being insistent that we had to cut the corporate tax rate. We had one of the highest tax rates in the developed world, and we cut it to below the average. We eliminated the death tax for nearly every American small business. We gave businesses the ability to deduct 100 percent of the cost of equipment. And because of the President's tax cuts, and because of the confidence that you all have shown, I'm told we've already seen a trillion dollars of investment brought back into this country from overseas. And members of the NAM have seen the impact on manufacturing firsthand. It's really been remarkable. I'm mean, all of you got behind these policies of tax cuts and all the reforms that we've advanced, and then you put them into practice. You didn't wait. I remember when we were talking about immediate expensing. The President said, ""We've got to do things that will encourage companies to move, and to move quickly, to get the American economy rolling again. And all of you did. I mean, last month, I met a business owner from Illinois at the White House, and she's been using her tax cut to invest a half a million dollars in new equipment, and hired 20 percent more workers, raised wages by 25 percent. She increased health insurance contributions and provided 401(k) match. And I think she's actually with us here today. HM Manufacturing, Nicole Walter, where are you? Let's give her a big round of applause. (Applause.) Take a bow, Nicole. Wow. Great job. And there's another company with us today who I'm told is using those tax cuts to create 170 new jobs at three new facilities in Ohio and back in the Hoosier State, and providing training for students at local schools and helping to train up that whole new generation of hardworking and prosperous Americans. So would you join me in recognizing BWX Technology and Rex Geveden? Rex, where are you? Take a bow, will you? (Applause.) Great job, Rex. Fantastic. I mean, really , it really is amazing. I mean, when , I remember when we signed, we were out on the South Lawn, and the President put his signature on that tax cut. Just a couple days later, we started hearing about companies that were bonusing , that were bonusing employees , and taking the kind of action that we just celebrated a minute ago. And I remember the President kind of hit me on the shoulder in the Oval Office and he said, ""Did you think people would, like, be handing out bonuses, like, in the first few weeks?"" I said, ""I didn't even know."" I mean, it was , you all had a vote of confidence immediately. And you said to your workers, you said to your employees, you said to the American people, this is what we need. And it literally revived the confidence of the American people. In fact, yesterday, I was just in South Carolina and I met with proud NAM members, Bill and Lou Kennedy of Nephron Pharmaceuticals. They were out there just like all of you. They were championing those tax cuts. They were saying the difference that they were going to make. And literally , literally, within hours , Jay, you know this story , literally, within hours of when the President signed the tax cuts into law, they gave every employee at Nephron Pharmaceuticals a 5 percent raise. It was an incredible contribution. And you can give them a round of applause. I just think the world of those special people. (Applause.) A great growing company. And I just heard they're getting ready to invest another $80 million to expand their facility outside Columbia. Just , it's incredible. And it's really working. And you all know it's working. You don't need me to wrap up your conference here today to tell you this is a booming economy. And I'm really here just to pay a debt of gratitude. And not just gratitude , not just gratitude from our administration, but can I just also express appreciation on behalf of working Americans? I mean, the truth is, Bill and Lou and Nicole and Rex are emblematic of all of the members of NAM. You've been investing in your companies, investing in working Americans thanks to the policies of this President and this administration. And you've really revived the confidence of the American people and opened doors of opportunity. And make no mistake about it , and you know it when you've walked the line at your company or you head down to the company cafeteria, they know what's going on. I mean, it's amazing to me. I hear a lot of debate on the other side of the aisle that's trying to talk down this economy, and I think they're going to have a real problem selling that to the American people. I mean, people know what's happening. They've got more money in their pockets. I mean, literally, the average American household today has more than $5,000 in their pockets in disposable income every year, thanks to the policies that NAM has supported. And they know it. I got to tell you, I took a day and half vacation. It's what we call a ""spring break"" in my line of work. (Laughter.) And we went down to , we went to , I don't know if you all know Fort Myers; there's a place called Sanibel Island. It's just off of Fort Myers, Florida. The President goes to Palm Beach; I go to Sanibel Island. (Laughter.) Karen and I were sitting out on the beach, Jay. True story. We were sitting out on the beach. Had sunglasses on, ball caps. Thought we were incognito, right? (Laughter.) Except that the local newspaper all , you know, had told that we were on the island. We love going there. Been going there for 30 years. And, anyway, we were sitting on the beach, and these two big boys in Budweiser shirts, tattoos down their arms, came walking by. And one of them looked at me, and he stopped and he pointed at me, and he said, ""You're Pence."" (Laughter.) And I said, ""Yes, sir. I am."" (Laughter.) And he looked at me and he said, ""Well, listen, you've got to tell the President to keep doing what he is doing, because I made twice as much money last year as I made the year before."" (Laughter.) But I told him I would. I promised him that. (Applause.) And I did. I did. And then he took two steps away and was kind of smiling to himself. He turned back around and he said, ""And I don't know what you do, but keep doing what you're doing too."" (Laughter.) And I told him I would. (Applause.) I mean, it's amazing. It's amazing to think of all that's happened here. And NAM has been there every step of the way. You really have. And it hasn't just been the tax cuts that you were out supporting. I mean, the changes in federal red tape and regulation , the regulatory relief that we've been able to pass, working in partnership with businesses around the country, have literally saved the American people, we think, about $3,100 per household, reducing the burden of regulations. You know, when he was running for this office, our President promised that for every new regulation we'd produce, that we would eliminate two regulations. And I got to be honest with you: You didn't keep that promise exactly. Because the truth is, as I stand before you today, President Trump has actually eliminated seven regulations for every new federal rule put on the books. (Applause.) I mean, President Trump, with the strong support of our allies in the Congress, literally in three short years, has rolled back more federal red tape than any President in American history. In fact, under the President's leadership, more than 90 percent of the regulations that NAM identified as hurting American manufacturing have already been cut or simplified. And we're grateful to each and every one of you. And that's how the system should work. You know, my second favorite President is Ronald Reagan. I'll let you guess who my favorite President is. (Laughter.) But Ronald Reagan said famously, in his first inaugural address , he said: Remember, we're a people with a government, not the other way around. Right? And what you saw this President do in a classic CEO style was reach out to business leaders around the country and say, ""What do you need? What underbrush , without compromising health or safety or environment, what can we clear out of the way so that you can invest and create jobs?"" And the truth is, that's what we've been able to do, and NAM has been a critical part of our success. And thanks to the President's efforts to roll back red tape, we've been able to unleash the economy and unleash American energy. I'm proud to report to you that the Unites States is now the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And this year, we will be a net exporter of energy for the first time is 75 years. (Applause.) How about that? So it's been about tax cuts, regulation, it's been about unleashing American energy, but it's also been about trade. And this President has been fighting every day for free, fair, and reciprocal trade. We've been working to open up markets, but open up markets in a way that puts American jobs, American manufacturing, and American workers first. Just the last month, it's been an incredible month of progress. And while the Congress is spending their time on other matters, you saw President Trump sign phase one of a new trade deal with China that for the first time includes the beginning of protections of intellectual property and will increase manufacturing exports by $50 billion in the next two years. (Applause.) It's a beginning. China has already begun lifting tariffs on American products. They've pledged to end currency manipulation. President Trump has made it clear , he's made it clear to President Xi and had me make it clear to President Xi and all the leadership of China that while our hearts go out to them as they struggle now with the coronavirus, America is going to continue to stand strong for American jobs and American workers. We're going to continue to negotiate, to level the playing field for American enterprise with China. The era of economic surrender is over. (Applause.) And, of course, just a couple of weeks after signing the phase one China deal , many of you were on the South Lawn of the White House when, thanks to your strong support and the support of millions of Americans and our allies in the Congress, President Trump signed the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. (Applause.) It really is an incredible accomplishment. We were talking , Mike and Jay and I were talking backstage with many members of the board about , I mean, the incredible accomplishment, which we believe would not have been possible with [sic] the support of business and strong support of all the business leaders gathered here. And we all know the impact that NAFTA had. For decades before President Trump took office , I don't have to tell all of you , we literally saw tens of thousands of factories close. Nearly a million jobs were lost or sent south of the border, including a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs. But as a candidate, and long before he ever thought about running for President, President Donald Trump knew we could do better. He knew we could renegotiate our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico in a way that put America first , that put American jobs, American workers, and American manufacturing first. And I watched him in these negotiations, and I got to tell you, he drove a hard bargain. This President rolled his sleeves up, he dug in, and we have a deal in the USMCA that is an unambiguous win for American workers, American manufacturing, and American agriculture. And we are grateful to each and every one of you for helping to bring it about. (Applause.) I mean, the truth is, under this President's leadership, we've already seen, thanks to companies like all of yours, 12,000 new factories built in this country. And we think the USMCA , thanks to your strong support and the support of millions of Americans , is going to create another 600,000 new jobs, including, we think, at least 50,000 manufacturing jobs right out of the gate. It really is remarkable to think. And it's not just more jobs; it's going to be better jobs. Our best estimate suggests that with the growth that the USMCA is going to drive in this country, we're projecting to see wages increase overall, and the biggest increases are projected to go to manufacturing workers as manufacturing continues to strengthen in this country. And I know that without the strong support of the NAM, all of that might not have been possible. You know, it's remarkable to think, you and your members held more than 1,000 meetings with members of Congress, you hosted events for the President, for myself at great companies like Caterpillar, JLS Automation, Shot North, Patriot Industries. And I traveled, literally, to 18 states at the President's direction. I might have been stopping in the districts of freshman Democrats in Congress just to make our point, but it was NAM every step of the way that was there saying, ""For manufacturing, for America, we need the USMCA."" So on behalf of the President of the United States and working Americans everywhere, thank you, NAM, for your support of the USMCA. (Applause.) You made a difference. You made a difference. So we've made great progress. We've made great progress opening markets around the world and unleashing American growth through tax cuts, regulatory reform, and the like. But I also came here today, as I did last time we spoke, to ensure you that we're going to continue to work to make sure that the American people have the skills and the training to meet the needs of a growing competitive manufacturing industry of the future. Now, this association actually tells us that nearly two thirds of America's manufacturers are concerned about finding workers with the right skill. Just a few days after a survey of , NFIB found that, that while business optimism is near an all-time high, a quarter of America's small businesses as well, including manufacturers, express concern about what you all call, ""the skills gap."" And I want to assure you that we are focused entirely on that issue. The good news is, in the last administration, we literally saw 500,000 people leave the American workforce. And in a much unreported number, as the President was celebrating that blue-collar boom in that State of the Union Address the other night, we're proud to report to the American people: In the last three years, 3.5 million Americans have come back into the workforce. We have a growing American economy because Americans are coming back to work. (Applause.) And make no mistake about it , make no mistake about it: There's still a lot of people on the sidelines. Our best estimate , our best estimate, according to our Council of Economic Advisers, is there's still literally 5- to 6 million able-bodied adults on the sidelines in this economy. And that's why opportunities to educate, to train, to give people the background and the training to seize the good-paying jobs in companies like yours are more important than ever before. And as we gather here today , I know it's just two days after you launched Creators Wanted Campaign , I'm proud to report that President Trump has , will continue to back the efforts just like that one to create job training and vocational education and make it more accessible than ever before. In fact, all of you know, because you've been such a big part of it: A year and a half ago, the President launched our Pledge to America's Workers. By signing the Pledge, companies like so many of you here, committed to creating training opportunities over the next five years for students, for workers, through apprenticeships, continuing education, and even on-the-job training. Now, when the Pledge was launched, the first-year goal was 500,000 training opportunities. And once again, we didn't exactly hit that number. As you all heard earlier this week, we've actually reached 15 million training opportunities and apprenticeships in America. American business is opening the doors to train American's workers, and we thank you. (Applause.) I mean, the President and I couldn't be more grateful to people in this room. We've secured training for nearly 1.2 million manufacturing workers across this country. And I just want you to know we're going to continue to partner with you. And let me just take the opportunity to say thank you for acknowledging a member of our administration who is , has a heart for American workers and a heart for American families. She is literally one of the , this administration's greatest champions of working families. And let me just thank you for extending the Alexander Hamilton Award to Ivanka Trump. She is so well deserving and she's making a difference for working families. Thank you for that. (Applause.) But just as you're helping to close the skills gap through the Creators Wanted Campaign, you've also been a strong advocate , a strong advocate for the President's agenda to rebuild America. You know, I love to remind people that the American people elected a builder to be President of the United States. And I promise you, you've never had anyone in the Oval Office more committed to rebuilding America's roads and bridges and airports and ports than President Donald Trump. (Applause.) I mean, you have your own ""Building to Win"" plan. You said that America should invest a trillion dollars in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And I'm sure you all took notice of the fact that with the strong support of NAM, the President just released our budget that called for a trillion dollars of investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And we're going to work our hearts out to get it done. (Applause.) I mean, this is a President that understands, as a builder, that roads mean jobs. And I'm not talking road jobs; we're talking about the right infrastructure is absolutely essential to the opportunity to expand and grow and create opportunities in communities large and small. I saw it when I was governor of the state of Indiana. When manufacturing was ready to grow, we started talking about pavement and curbs and asphalt, and it's absolutely vital. And I want you to understand this administration understands that. And I just want to encourage you that even in these divided times on Capitol Hill, there is still time. I'm told by some Democrat leaders in Congress that they've got a bill; we've got a bill in the United States Senate. We're ready to go to work. I know we got elections coming up this November, but there's no time like the present. Congress should work on an infrastructure bill and they should work on it and get it done this year. (Applause.) Go tell them that. So I really just came to say thanks. Thanks to your strong support of this President and his agenda, the strong support of our allies in Congress, we've been able to cut taxes, roll back red tape, unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade, and create millions of training opportunities for the American people. And when you look at this record, it's really been remarkable to think about it. I want to say to all of you , I hope you have figured out already: American manufacturing has never had a greater champion in the Oval Office than President Donald Trump. And we're going to keep working every day , keep working every day to not just to earn your confidence, but to give you confidence to invest; to give you the confidence to know that this is a President that believes in growth. And I just wanted to come by today to say thank you. I know it's been a long few days for all of you, and you've probably got a stack of emails and mail and business waiting for you back at your desk. I know how that works. But I'm really honored , really honored to have a chance to maybe send you off from this board meeting just with a word of gratitude, really and truly. It's amazing to think of what NAM has meant in the life of this country for 125 years. A hundred and twenty-five years ago, 500 manufacturers gathered just a few steps from the Ohio River and decided that American manufacturing needed a voice in Washington, D.C., and in statehouses across the country, and they came together. Now, those 500 original members are 14,000 companies, and 90 percent of them are small- and medium-sized businesses like so many that are so well represented here on this board. Members of this association made incredible contributions, as I said before, to the life of our nation. From the Model T, to the microchip, 747, and beyond, companies represented in this room make products used around our nation, around the world, and in the vast reaches of outer space. And we're going to continue to promote the policies that make it more possible for you to create even more. I mean, manufacturing has changed a lot since those days 125 years ago, but one thing will never change: Manufacturing and people who make things are the backbone of the American economy. It's true today and it will always be true. (Applause.) So I'll make you a promise: This President, this Vice President, and our administration are going to continue to work , continue to work as we revive the American economy together, as we keep this boom growing. So I want to encourage you to keep supporting all the policies we've talked about today, and keep supporting the people that support them. I mean, we've got a little election coming up here in a few months, and we'll be grateful for your support. But I think it's just , we're going to work our hearts out to get President Donald Trump four more years in the White House. But I think we also ought to make sure we get behind men and women and we elect pro-growth Republican majorities to the United States Senate again, and we reelect a conservative, Republican majority to the United States House of Representatives. We'll get America growing again, and we'll advance this agenda that has a more prosperous America working. (Applause.) So go tell the story to your suppliers, to your business associates, to all your contacts, to your friends, to your neighbors. Tell them all that we've accomplished. Talk about how we've been able to unleash this economy through commonsense American policies. You know, that's the President's favorite term. He'll stop conversations sometimes in the Oval Office and say, ""It's just common sense."" And that's what we've been advancing, is the common sense and the common values of the American people that understand that when you let people keep more of what they earn, when you get government out of the way, when you open up markets on a fair and a balanced way around the world, when you unleash the vast natural resources of America, America comes roaring back. You all have proven that every day over the last three years. And we're going to work our hearts out to make sure you continue to prove it. And finally, let me just thank you for one other way. You know, I believe with all of my heart that every one of us are born with certain God-given abilities. Some have the gift of leadership, and you all have proven that in your lives and in your careers. Some have the gift of service. Some have the gift of hospitality. But some, as all of you know better than most, are gifted with the skill to create, to build things, to make things. I mean, you all know it's been the engineers, it's been the craftsman, the welder, the carpenter, the brick-layer, the mechanic that have built America. And all of you, and all of your companies, large and small, you create opportunities for people to live out their calling. And that really should be the object of our education system in this country is to help people discover those God-given abilities and then put them to work to create a better future for themselves, their families, their community, and their nation. I mean, the truth of the matter is that all of you have enriched , in your careers, in the life of your companies, and the life of this nation , manufacturing has enriched the lives of American families in countless ways. And I promise you we're going to continue. And we're going to continue to work closely with you to make sure that those dreams can continue to come true for working Americans, as your companies continue to grow and expand in this economy. And I truly do believe that thanks , thanks to your great support at the National Association of Manufacturers, we've made America great again. And with your continued support, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, with the support of millions of Americans who enjoy the benefits and the opportunities your companies afford: We're going to see American manufacturing strengthen like never before. We're going to create more through greater innovation than ever before. We're going to sell it across this country and sell it across this world. And with your help and your leadership and God's help, we'll keep America great. Thanks, everybody. God bless you. (Applause.) Thank you for your leadership. God bless America.

VSMP192202034	Mike Pence	2020-02-19	Remarks by Vice President Pence to NASA Langley Research Center Personnel and Guests	speech	"12:43 P.M. EST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for that very warm welcome. To Administrator Jim Bridenstine, Secretary Betsy DeVos, to Congresswoman Elaine Luria, and most especially to Director Clayton Turner and all of the incredible men and women who have been making great ideas take flight for 100 years: It is an honor to be here at Langley Research Center. (Applause.) And Director Turner and I have been walking through wind tunnels and talking about flights to the Moon and to Mars, and seeing the new technology coming together. And I have to tell you, Mr. Director, it's been truly inspiring. Although, he said that , he said to me, just a few moments ago, what inspires him most is all of you. He said his whole job as the Director of Langley Research Center is , and I'm quoting now , is ""to create an environment where all of you can continue to be amazing."" (Applause.) So join me in thanking Director Clayton Turner one more time. Stand up, will you? Thank you, Director Turner. Thanks for doing such a great , (applause) , you can show your appreciation. This is a man who loves this institution and is a great, great leader in this program. Thank you so much. It really is great to be here with so many incredibly talented and brilliant men and women. You are part of a century of legacy here that's been enabling incredible progress in American leadership in space. And it's my great honor to be with each and every one of you. And as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine who is also a great friend of American leadership in space and all of the men and women who have made it happen , past, present, and future. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, as our NASA Administrator just said, from the earliest days of this administration, it's been my great privilege to serve as chairman of the National Space Council. I remember when we were campaigning for these jobs that the American people gave the President and I, he picked up the phone one day and called me, and he said , he said, ""You know, I'm thinking of restarting the National Space Council."" It had been dormant for 25 years. And he said, ""Mike, historically, the Vice President has chaired that National Space Council, and I wonder if you would have an interest."" What I didn't tell him was that this small-town boy from southern Indiana's favorite memories of my youth were sitting in front of a black and white television as we saw one small step for man become one giant leap for mankind. I didn't tell him that when our kids were very young, we actually vacationed at Cape Canaveral just so we could go see the rockets. I didn't tell him that, all of my life, my imagination had been fired by American leadership in space. So I just said , when he asked me if I'd chair the National Space Council, I said, ""Would I? Are you kidding?"" And it's been my great honor to lead the National Space Council that, thanks to President Donald Trump's leadership, has renewed American leadership in space. (Applause.) True. And being among all of you here at Langley Research Center, it's an honor to be with men and women who I just know , and I heard the latest on the progress that we're making , I know the men and women in this room are going to play a decisive role when, in four years' time, we return American astronauts to the Moon , (applause) , and make sure that the next men and the first woman on the Moon are Americans. (Applause.) But more on that , more on that in a moment. It is a special privilege for me to be here at Langley today, to walk these grounds, to see these facilities. Really, to see, in so many way, where it all began. For more than a century , it's amazing to think of it , the men and women of Langley Research Center have been leading our country into the vast unknown. And what's even more remarkable about all you've accomplished is, for one reason or another, it seemed like, more than 50 years ago, we were always starting from a step behind. But thanks to the ingenuity and the innovation of men and women here at Langley Research Center, America caught up, caught up fast, and has been leading ever since. You know, it's easy to forget that in 1917, when Langley was actually founded, the Wright Brothers had launched the aviation age on Kitty Hawk just 14 years before. But at that time, I'm told England, Germany, and Russia had more than 1,000 airplanes, while the United States only had 30. By the end of World War II, though, thanks to the groundbreaking research conducted at Langley's state-of-the-art wind tunnels, not only were American aircraft the gold standard of aviation design, but in a few short years, we would fly faster than the very speed of sound. And, in fact, the man who broke the sound barrier just turned 98 [97] years young last week. Let's hear it for General Chuck Yeager , (applause) , and for all of you who designed the aircraft that went Mach 1 and beyond. There was another moment in history too , it was 1957, a couple years before I was born. The eyes of the nation again turned to Langley, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik into orbit. The space race was on, and America was hurrying to catch up. Soon, the truth was the Soviets would widen their lead by sending the first man into space. But the men and women of Langley were up to the challenge. They took President Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s personally. In fact, it was your own engineer, John Houbolt, who perfected the idea of just how to land on the lunar surface, and all of the Apollo astronauts actually trained in these facilities. It's amazing to think that, and it's an incredible legacy. In fact, I'm told that it was in the docking simulator in this very hangar that Neil Armstrong learned how to land on the Moon. It gives me chills to think about it. You know, and it was a testament to the preparation he received here that when he was asked what it was like to walk on the lunar surface, Neil Armstrong said, ""[Just] like Langley."" (Applause.) That's impressive. In the years that followed, you all continued to excel, continued to push our nation further into the new frontier , landing a spacecraft on Mars in 1976; developing the space shuttle; helping to build the International Space Station, where American astronauts have now served for more than two decades. Here at Langley Research Center, literally, you've led the nation , and, frankly, led the world , in the advance of science and technology. And I'd be , I'd be remiss if I didn't another may , another way that you all have pushed forward , for in your eagle-eyed mission and your focus, you not only broke the sound barrier and inspired the nation, here at Langley Research Center, you broke the color barrier as well, and all of America celebrates. (Applause.) It's true. You all know we're standing in the home of the legendary ""Hidden Figures"" , African American women, also known as ""human computers,"" who, despite the injustice of working in a segregated facility, lent our nation their incredible intellects and talents and helped us not only win the space race but also , also become a more perfect union. Like one of the first African American women to work for NASA: She was born in West Virginia in 1918. She had a love for numbers even at an early age, I'm told. She counted everything: the number of steps to the road, the number of steps to church, the number of dishes or silverware she washed every evening. Everything she counted. By 13, I'm told she was going to high school on the campus of West Virginia State College. By 18 years of age, she actually graduated from that college. In fact, a couple of her family members just told me that she , she addressed the graduation at that college not too long ago. After graduation, she then left her job as a schoolteacher to settle down to a quiet life as a homemaker until history came knocking on her door. She heard about an opening, I'm told, at the West Area Computing section here at Langley. Led by her fellow West Virginian Dorothy Vaughan, she decided to apply. She was hired in 1953, and it didn't take long for her colleagues to recognize her intellect and her ability. And I'm told her big moment came in 1962. NASA was preparing to make John Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth, but the mission hit a snag. Although the engineers had used the best automatic computers available to calculate the exact trajectory of Glenn's space capsule, I read that he wanted to be absolutely certain the machines' calculations were right. And John Glenn, history records, told them, ""Get the girl"" and have her check the calculations, by hand, with her desktop calculating machine. And once she was finished, John Glenn was reassured. And he said, ""If she says they're good, then I'm ready to go."" (Applause.) And he was. In fact, tomorrow marks 58 years since John Glenn's historic orbit. And what a debt this nation owes to him and just as much to that woman who helped make it happen. At 101 years young, she is still with us, thank God. In 2015, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Today, her name graces the Computational Research Facility on this campus. And we all remember the extraordinary motion picture that inspired the nation just a few short years ago. So let me say, in honor of African American History Month, join me in recognizing a truly great American pioneer, Katherine G. Johnson. (Applause.) And join me in thanking her two incredible daughters, Joylette Hylick and Kathy Moore. Would you all please stand? These are two great ambassadors of their mom's achievements and of everything great about the American space program. Join me in thanking this incredible family. (Applause.) Thank you, ladies. Thank you so much. You know, we all owe a debt to many of the women of the ""Hidden Figures"" era, like Katherine, who broke down racial barriers while she pushed the frontier of human knowledge; like another one , an engineer from Monroe, North Carolina. When she was a little girl, I'm told, instead of playing with her dolls, she'd take them apart and put them back together, or she'd help her father work on his car , anything to learn how things worked. After graduating from Hampton University with a degree in mathematics, she heard about the opportunity to work here at Langley, become one of those human computers , brilliant people gathered here. And NASA snatched her up. But she wasn't done yet. In 1975, after crunching data for eight years, she decided it was time to start creating data. She asked her supervisor why men with a similar education to hers were being hired as engineers, while women were not. Stumped, her supervisor transferred her to the engineering section, to our great benefit, where she became one of the first woman aerospace engineers in NASA history. And during her 40-year career, she became, frankly, one of the world's leading experts on supersonic flight, which she continues to offer her insights today. For her life, for her contributions , past, present, and future , to American leadership in aeronautics and in space, join me in recognizing Dr. Christine Darden. (Applause.) Dr. Darden, thank you for your leadership, for your example, for all you've done for America and for the space program. (Applause.) It's such an honor to be with you today. Thank you. Thank you so much. You know, ever since Katherine and Christine came to NASA, all of you here at Langley have continued that proud tradition of empowering Americans from all walks of life and every background to take part in the extraordinary experience of human exploration and discovery. And for all that you've accomplished here at Langley Research Center, it's , it's how you have done it, bringing all of the best of America together to do it. It's really a way that Langley Research Center has inspired the nation in two ways , not just for what you've done but for who you are. I mean, ""Hidden Figures"" , ""Hidden Figures"" inspire us about your great contributions to the life of this nation today. But the really good news is that ""Hidden Figures"" have given way to the ""Modern Figures,"" many of whom are with us here today. Am I right? (Applause.) In fact, a couple of them I wanted to mention. Join me in recognizing the first African American Deputy Director of Johnson Space Center. She is with us here today and is truly an amazing American and , Vanessa Wyche. Where are you, Vanessa? I knew I'd written it down. Vanessa, stand up. Come on. She's here from Johnson Space Center. (Applause.) And then join me in recognizing an incredible American astronaut, Stephanie Wilson, who is with us today. Stephanie, thank you , (applause) , for your courageous contributions to the space program. And I've mentioned him before, but he just also happens to be the first African American Director of Langley Research Center. Clayton Turner, thank you. Thank you for your leadership and your example. (Applause.) You're all great Americans. The truth is, people here at Langley have led our nation to dominance in the skies and in space. You've led us to important milestones and toward a more perfect union. And now the eyes of the nation are turning on Langley once again. And I'm here today, on behalf of the President of the United States, to encourage you to bring your renewed energies to our new mission, maybe the most ambition , ambitious mission of all in the history of Langley. You know, in our first year in office, President Trump signed what came to be known as Space Policy Directive-1. We made it the policy of the United States of America to return to the Moon and prioritize crewed missions to the lunar surface. And ever since his signature dried on that document, I know all of NASA and Langley Research Center have been busy at work. I was inspired to get an update on that today. I'm pleased to report to you as well that thanks to the efforts of so many of you here, before we even get to the summer, with the strong support of all of you, the United States will return American astronauts to space on American rockets, from American soil. We're going back. (Applause.) And we're going back from the USA. It's amazing to think , it's amazing to think , because Stephanie and I were talking about it, this courageous astronaut , it's been about 10 years since we grounded the American shuttle program. And since that time, we've been catching a ride from other nations up to the International Space Station. But those days are over. And the NASA Administrator will testify I only call him about once a week to make sure that we're still on track. And I know the imagination of the American people is going to be fired , it's going to be fired anew as they see courageous men and women once again take that long walk, ride the elevator up, and climb into the capsule and return to space on American rockets. But as we renew our commitment to human space exploration, the President also made it the policy of the United States to return to the Moon in a set period of time, within the next five years. And the Director and I were talking about the fact, and I was inspired to hear, that when the President gave me the privilege in Huntsville of announcing our intention to return to the Moon within the next five years, he said there was someone who was planning to retire who said, ""You know what? I'm going to put off my retirement because I want to be here at Langley Research Center when we get back to the Moon."" (Applause.) And you've got to thank him for me. Together we're going to ensure that the first woman and next man on the Moon will be American astronauts. As President Trump said, we will ""return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use,"" not only to ""plant our flag and leave our footprint,"" but once we get back to the Moon, as the President said, we're going to ""establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars."" We are going Moon to Mars, and Langley Research Center is going to get us there. (Applause.) I don't have to tell all of you that Langley is going to be absolutely vital to this mission. As I learned again today touring the facilities, I know you're hard at work testing, in the wind tunnels, the SLS Space Launch System. It's the most powerful rocket NASA will have ever built. You've developed the Launch Abort System. You're building the laser radar systems to enable our astronauts to land precisely on the Moon. Near the water, they'll need to sustain a long-term presence. You're testing new heat-shield designs to help our astronauts navigate the treacherous Martian atmosphere when we get there. And I'm also told you're working with industry partners to develop the robotic space assembly and construction technology we need to land on Mars. I was actually very impressed with all the robotics that we just saw that would be actually building the structures on the surface of the Moon while our astronauts are doing the exploration work. It's really impressive. And to actually see that young engineer using an Xbox controller while he ran the whole thing was even more impressive. (Laughter.) We're capturing the enthusiasm of a new generation of American pioneers, and we're bringing all of the best technology , and you here at Langley are making it happen. So I really came by today just to say thank you. Thank you for what all of you are doing in this renewed mission for American leadership in space. And I want to assure you, under President Trump's leadership, we're not only going to have the will, we're not only going to have the goal, but we are going to make sure that NASA and Langley have the budget to get the job done. (Applause.) We're going to do it. In fact, President Trump has already signed into law the largest budget ever for NASA in the modern era. And just last week, the President unveiled this year's budget for NASA, which calls for a NASA budget of more than $25 billion. It's a 12 percent increase. And let me just say, I can assure you that the support for NASA is strong and broad in Washington, D.C., and it is truly bipartisan. And I do want to thank Congresswoman Elaine Luria for your strong support not just of Langley, but of NASA. And thank you for being here today as well. (Applause.) Now, of that amount, you'll be glad to know, of the $25 billion in our budget, more than $12 billion is dedicated to making the Moon to Mars mission a reality. We are putting the resources of the American people behind the goals that President Trump has set and that you all are going to be tasked to make happen. But we all know that we won't get to the Moon , or Mars, for that matter , by relying on government efforts alone. This is a nationwide effort, as, frankly, our space program has always been. Isn't that right? We need all hands on deck. And we're not going back to the Moon by ourselves. We're going to be going with your support, with the great support of all of the civilian leadership here at Langley and the around the country, and we're going to be leading with new commercial partners and freedom-loving international partners as we pave the way back to the Moon and Mars. That's why, frankly, under the President's leadership, we've taken decisive action to unleash private sector space exploration like never before. You know, the President puts it very succinctly: He wanted us to clear out the regulatory hurdles to private space exploration because, as the President said, rich guys love rockets, and we want to let them build them and carry us back into space. Right? (Applause.) We want to see , we want to see that entrepreneurial spirit continue to develop, and it is. I don't have to tell you here at Langley about the incredible entrepreneurial energy behind the space enterprise in the United States. You all are going to continue to be partners with all those private sector companies to make that happen. And I want you to know our administration is absolutely committed to making it possible for men and women in American businesses to meet our low-Earth orbit needs, to provide for space tourism and to provide for the basics of space exploration and travel so that we can focus our energy on going farther and faster and beyond , getting back to the Moon and then on to Mars, and leading mankind in human space exploration. It'll be the people here at Langley and NASA centers nationwide that are going to be partnering with all those private sector firms and organizations. And I encourage you to do so. We've been hard at work streamlining licensing regimes that oversee commercial launch, re-entry, and remote sensing operations. You know, it's amazing , the Director and I were talking about some of this before , but it's amazing that people that were looking to get a license to launch a rocket on the West Coast had to get a different license to launch a rocket on the East Coast. And so we've standardized all of it, we've worked on a space traffic management, and we're removing outdated regulations that increase costs and, frankly, stifle innovation. We've also encouraged a more stable space environment by developing that traffic management system. And, today, NASA is leading commercial-friendly efforts to plan the orbital platforms that will eventually succeed the International Space Station, as well as lunar landers that'll carry us once we're back on the Moon. So I want to assure all of you that not only do you have the support of this President, this Vice President, but I have every confidence that you have the support and the admiration of the American people. Stephanie and I were just talking about this, and she agreed with me, so I must be right. (Laughter.) That once we have American astronauts on American rockets being launched from American soil, the American people are going to know we're serious, right? And I think it's going to continue to fire the imagination of the people of this country. The broad, bipartisan support that we have on Capitol Hill, I think, is a reflection of the fact that America is ready to go again. We're ready to lead again. We're, in so many ways, a nation of pioneers. And you all , some of you here, literally , and your families and all of you individually are part of that pioneering generation. So get ready to get busy. The President has directed NASA and the Administrator to accomplish our goal to return to the Moon and then on to Mars not only within five years, but let me be clear: The President has made it clear that we're going to accomplish this goal by any means necessary. In order to succeed, we are going to continue to focus on the mission over the means. We want to challenge each one of you here at Langley: Consider every available option and platform to meet our goals, including industry, government, and the entire American space enterprise. It's the reason why we're cutting out the underbrush of needless regulations and barriers to innovation, because we want you all to be able to reach, to engage, and to draw on the best ideas in America to get us where we're going by the time we set ourselves to get there. Our administration is absolutely committed to this goal and we want you all to have the same determination and resolve to get there. And this President and this administration and the American people are committed to achieving this goal through NASA and through the Langley Research Center. (Applause.) So let me at least give you one word of admonition on behalf of your President and on behalf of the entire National Space Council: More than ever before, we want you to engage your imaginations, your creativity. Challenge one another. You know, there's that old proverb that says, ""Iron sharpens iron."" So I encourage you to come in every day with that same impatience and energy that, frankly, I heard in the voices of everybody that Director Turner introduced me to today. The enthusiasm as we walked through the Center, the fire in their eyes , just let that be in your eyes. And as I said before: Engage with the private sector. Demand that they bring their best into this effort as we , as we lead America and America leads in human space exploration again. The truth is, I know I'm standing before some of the most brilliant people in this country or in the world. But there's also many in the private sector who are going to benefit. They're going to benefit from your knowledge, from your collaboration. And we encourage you to reach out, to engage them in every appropriate way to help us achieve our mission. Keep building on the partnership that the American space program has always been in this country. You know, it's never been enough, here at Langley Research Center, to sit behind a desk and perfect theories. Theories are meant to be tested. And each one of you are men and women who understand that you're in the testing business. You develop the theories here and then you've made sure, through the generations, that they've worked. So I want to challenge you to continue to bring your renewed energies to that. And challenge our partners in the private sector to do the same, to give us new perspectives and know-how , how to make the ideas and the goals of the American people a reality. Innovation never happens in a vacuum. Langley has been proving that now for a century. So we encourage you to bring , bring it all together. Bring the team together. Challenge one another and challenge our partners around the country to join us. And the best ideas come from debate, they come from testing, they come from conflict. So I just encourage you to get out of the office, keep working hand in hand with all of our partners around the country, and know that we're going to have your back every step of the way. And in the midst of all of that, I just encourage you to have faith. Have faith in one another. I mean, you all are , you all are 100 years into an extraordinary enterprise here at Langley Research Center. It's humbling to think of all the history that's passed through this place. And here at Langley, you have a tradition of excellence, of open-mindedness, of partnership, of collaboration, innovation. Now more than ever, we need you. We need you to continue that tradition as America renews our leadership in space. But just believe in one another, in the limitless capacity of the American people to accomplish any mission once we set our minds to it. It's what we proved when I was a little boy, when a President gave a speech and said we would land a man on the Moon by the end of a decade. And I had an astronaut tell me not long ago what was remarkable about that is we didn't know how to do it, we didn't have the equipment to do it, we didn't have the people trained to do it, but America did it. And we're going to do it again. (Applause.) So I leave here today with renewed confidence. I have to tell you , Administrator Bridenstine knows , I just , I talked to some of those people over at the last facility and I just said we need to get these people on the road. The enthusiasm here is contagious. And I have every confidence , I have faith in each and every one of you that you're going to live up to the incredible legacy of which you are a part here at Langley Research Center. You're going to continue to innovate, you're going to continue to develop the ideas of the future to achieve all of our goals. And I have to tell you, I also have faith in this new generation of astronauts. We just graduated the new class of astronauts down in Houston, didn't we? I was there two years ago when they started their training. And I told a story then that, back in Indiana, we have a saying that, when you see a box turtle on a fence post, one thing you know for sure is he didn't get there on his own. And the astronaut class went on to name themselves ""The Turtles."" (Laughter.) And it's an incredible group of men and women. I mean, the technologies and the theories that you are developing here at Langley Research Center are going to carry aloft an incredible group of men and women that are going to create all new history for America and for mankind, on the Moon and Mars, and beyond. And when it happens, just like it happened before, there'll be heroes that we'll celebrate who will have ticker tape parades and meetings at the White House. But I want you to know your President and your Vice President knows that every bit as much credit will go to each and every one of you here at Langley Research Center. You made it happen before, and we know you'll make it happen again. And we know, as you do all of your work, you'll make sure that all those courageous Americans are to go into space as safe and secure as our abilities will allow them to go. And I also know that, for millions of Americans, as we renew our commitment to human space exploration, we'll , we'll say that old prayer that Americans have prayed throughout our history for our explorers and all those who go into harm's way in the name of America, in the name of freedom: That those who rise on the wings of the dawn, who settle on the far side of the sea, even those who go up to the heavens will know that even there, His hand will guide them and His right hand will hold them fast. That will be our prayer. The strong leadership of America in space made possible by our heroes and made possible by Langley Research Center. So keep up the great work. We're going, Langley, and we're counting on all of you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. God bless you and God bless America. (Applause.) END 1:19 P.M.

VSMP192202033	Mike Pence	2020-02-19	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Proton Therapy Institute Roundtable	speech	"Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Harvey. And it is really an honor to be here at the Proton Therapy Institute, but a greater honor to be with you and with this wonderful team and wonderful students from Hampton University. This is an extraordinary institution. And as we celebrate African American History Month , we just came from Langley Research Center where we talked about ""Hidden Figures"" and the tremendous progress that our researchers have made there, not only in advancing scientific understanding, but advancing a more perfect union. And Hampton University, I know, has been there every step of the way, making history and making a difference as a historically black college in this country. But let me also say, Hampton University and the Proton Therapy Institute are just an incredible asset for Virginia and for the United States of America. This is an educational institution of a tremendous reputation. And let me say to you, Dr. Harvey, I know you have the respect of all of the alumni of this school , generations who have gone through here under your leadership. And let me invite everybody to show our appreciation to Dr. Harvey for his incredible (inaudible). (Applause.) I want to extend greetings from our mutual friend, the President of the United States, who has come to appreciate Hampton University but also to appreciate your leadership with no small amount of effort on your part. We couldn't be more proud, under this administration and President Trump's leadership, to see the renewed investment in HBCUs. And as I said to you privately, I'll say with cameras in the room: Dr. Harvey, you played a leading role, including, very recently, when the President of the United States signed a measure to make federal funding for HBCUs permanent in this country. And the increases, the investment, all are a reflection of the quality of education but the importance of this educational tradition in our country. But I want to make sure people around the table know the role that you've played in all of that and how grateful the President and I are. It is remarkable to think , I know I won't have an opportunity to see the Emancipation Oak today, but I saw its offspring. (Laughter.) And to think of the history here is very humbling for me , that 20 students, 1861. And today, you're a world-class university with more than 4,000 students, 40 states, 28 countries. It's an incredible legacy. You have understood, since your founding, what Frederick Douglass says: that ""education means emancipation."" And Hampton University has been there creating educational opportunities and excellence that's , that has generations of leadership in your wake. And we admire you greatly. I was , I was moved to learn that one of your most famous alumni was one of my heroes, Booker T. Washington, who , we had , we had a brush with part of his legacy when President Trump, at the State of the Union Address, just a few short days ago, recognized General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen. And it would be Booker T. Washington that started the Tuskegee Institute and began that great tradition. And my son is a Marine Corps aviator. My son-in-law is a Navy pilot. So we're pretty partial to pilots in our family. (Laughter.) And I think I was the first person to congratulate General McGee after the President promoted him to general. He walked in the White House as a colonel at the , at the youthful age of 100 years, and he left as a general. And it's well-deserved. And we honor him as we honor that great legacy emerging from one of your great alums. Hampton University's , continues to pioneer in a broad range of fields. But let me say, as I close: To be here at the Proton Therapy Institute, to see firsthand the difference that you all have made in such a short period of time, it is , it's remarkable to think about the thousands of patients who have come in here, some of whom I met today, who have literally received lifesaving innovative proton treatment for cancer. And it was scarcely 10 years ago, Dr. Harvey, that this was a brain child of yours and of Hampton University. And thanks to your leadership and the generosity of people around the country and the excellent team you have here, you're really changing lives. And I'm looking forward to hearing more about how we can be helpful and support not only the mission of Hampton University but specifically about the Proton Therapy Institute. And to that end, I'm very grateful to be joined by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos who has been a great champion of HBCUs in our administration, a great advocate of the progress that we've made for HBCUs since the outset of our administration. And on her behalf and on the President's behalf, thank you for such a warm welcome."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1402539/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-a-proton-therapy-institute-roundtable&speechType=1	Higher Education Science		Hampton, VA	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-proton-therapy-institute-roundtable-hampton-va/
VSMP135202014	Mike Pence	2020-05-13	Readout from the Vice President's Discussion with Higher Education Leaders	statement	Today, Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with higher education leaders from across the country to discuss the all-of-America approach to respond to COVID-19 and drive America's phased economic revival.Vice President Pence, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx discussed best practices to get students back to school in the Fall. They discussed guidance released by President Trump and the CDC which calls upon colleges and universities to develop, implement and maintain a plan to ensure the health and safety of students, faculty and staff. The Vice President thanked everyone on the call for their hard work in accomplishing this goal. President Trump's leadership and the efforts of the American people have saved lives, slowed the spread of the coronavirus and allowed states to begin opening up. These college and university leaders discussed possible options to re-open their campuses for students, faculty and staff safely and responsibly. Many participants on the call discussed working groups they developed on campus to provide data-driven strategies for re-opening. Participants discussed the importance of opening and maintaining research labs to assist with COVID-19 research, testing and tracing. The discussion provided insight into a new chapter of re-opening America, and what colleges and universities are doing to meet their individual needs, aligned with state leadership. The Vice President thanked the group for their commitment to safely re-open their institutions, and indicated he looked forward to additional updates on progress in the near future.Participants on the call:President of Purdue University and the 49th governor of Indiana Mitch Daniels, Jr.President of University of Texas- El Paso and the 24th Secretary of Air Force Dr. Heather WilsonPresident of Hillsdale College Dr. Larry ArnnPresident of Marquette University Dr. Michael LovellPresident of the University of Virginia James E.

VSMP305202013	Mike Pence	2020-05-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Kennedy Space Center	statement	"Well, hello, NASA! (Applause.) Hello, SpaceX! (Applause.) And hello, America's future in space! (Applause.) To the Governor, to Leader McCarthy, to members of the House and Senate, members of the Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs, to Jim Bridenstine and the incredible men and women of NASA and SpaceX, it's an honor and a joy for me to be here with the President of United States at Kennedy Space Center on the day we made history , (applause) , on the day American astronauts returned to space on an American rocket from American soil for the first time in nearly 10 years. You did it. (Applause.) You know, for too long, the American space program was neglected and ignored. Those days are over. Under President Donald Trump, NASA is back and America is leading in space once again. (Applause.) You know, it's been more than 50 years since our nation first set out to leave this planet and land American astronauts on the Moon. Today, under this President, we begin a new mission: to return to the Moon and ultimately land American astronauts on the face of Mars. (Applause.) You know, when the Apollo rockets leaped into the skies in the 1960s, they rose above the tumult and the clamor of their times. They were a symbol of national strength and unity. And today, as states across the nation take their first steps to reopen and recover from an unprecedented pandemic and as our nation reels from the tragic death of George Floyd and violent protests of the past few days, I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s. (Applause.) In America, every life matters. There's no tolerance for racism or violence in the streets of this country. As the President has made clear, we will honor the memory of George Floyd, justice will be served, we will have law and order in our streets, and we will heal our land. And as the people of this country did so long ago, we will prove again that even in the most challenging times, Americans rise above. We always move forward, we overcome every obstacle, we reach new heights, and we reach them together. (Applause.) It's true. And in that spirit, today we begin a new era of human space exploration. And the credit goes to dedicated men and women all across this country, to the ingenuity and the hard work of the entire NASA team. America is proud of the men and women of NASA. (Applause.) But for the first time in our history, our astronauts have taken to the skies on a commercial rocket built by America's private sector. So join me in a vigorous round of applause for Elon Musk and the dedicated men and women of SpaceX. Job well done. (Applause.) That's great. Well deserved. (Applause.) Thanks, Elon. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the personal courage and the unflinching skill of two American astronauts. One of them is an active duty colonel in the Air Force. He, like his crewmate, was accepted in the NASA Astronaut Corps in 2000; he served on several shuttle missions. The other was the first Marine pilot to fly the Super Hornet, and he's logged hours in more than 25 aircraft. In fact, his second flight was the very last space shuttle from American soil in July 2011. So would you join me in giving a vigorous round of applause to Commander Bob Behnken and Commander Doug Hurley? We are proud of our American astronauts. (Applause.) Because of their courage and your hard work, America is leading in space again. Today is the culmination of three and a half years of renewed leadership in space. It's a tribute to our astronauts. It's a tribute to ingenuity of the men and women of SpaceX and NASA. But I'm here to tell you it's also a tribute to the vision and leadership of a President who, from the very first days of this administration, was determined to revive NASA and American leadership in human space exploration. Today is a tribute to the leadership of President Donald Trump. (Applause.) As the President said in his Inaugural Address, ""We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space."" And that's exactly what we're doing. The President revived the National Space Council after it laid dormant for 25 years. He brought together the best minds in and out of government to revive the American space enterprise. We reformed the national space traffic management system. We streamlined regulations for the commercial use of space. And in 2017, President Trump made it the policy of the United States to return to the Moon by 2024 and ensure that the next man and the first woman to set foot on the Moon would be American astronauts. And we're on our way. (Applause.) And at the President's direction, we won't just go back to the Moon. Mission Artemis is going to take us to the Moon, and then America will make the next ""giant leap,"" and we're going to land American astronauts on Mars. (Applause.) So we're leading again , for our prosperity, for our explorer spirit. But we're also leading for the security of the American people. As nations around the world increase their investment in space, this President also took the decisive step to ensure that America remains as dominant in space as we are in land and air and sea when he created the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years: the United States Space Force. (Applause.) So the American people can be confident, after today's history-making launch, that we're just getting started. And under this President's leadership, with the courage of our astronauts, the ingenuity of NASA and private partners like SpaceX, the support of the American people, and God's grace, we will never stop pushing to reach new heights, to go farther and faster and higher than ever before. We will inspire the world as America leads humanity into the vast expanse of space for generations to come. And now it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the man whose vision and relentless leadership brought us to this historic day: the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump.

VSMP36202012	Mike Pence	2020-06-03	Readout from the Vice President's Governors Briefing on COVID-19 Response & Recovery	statement	Today, Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 States, territories, and the city of Washington, DC, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to update our Nation's governors on local, State, and Federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. To open up the meeting, Chaplain of the United States Senate, Rear Admiral Barry Black led the group in prayer. The Vice President assured the Governors that the Administration would honor the memory of George Floyd, justice would be done, and at a time of civil unrest we would continue to protect the rights, property, and lives of all our people. As President Trump has said, the American people expect law and order, and Vice President Pence thanked those governors who have provided adequate resources to keep America's communities safe. The briefing focused on protecting our most vulnerable Americans including nursing home residents and Americans with underlying health conditions, including those in African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities. Vice President Pence led a discussion of best practices from our Nation's governors on re-opening their States and communities in a phased-approach while expanding testing, protecting and supporting our most vulnerable Americans including nursing home residents and expanding healthcare capacity. Protecting vulnerable seniors in nursing homes is a top priority for the Trump Administration , in fact it was the first ask that the Vice President made to our Nation's governors on March 2. Administrator Seema Verma of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) discussed the recently released information to States on survey activities, CARES Act funding, and enhanced enforcement for infection control deficiencies in nursing homes. The Vice President and other Federal leaders asked governors and their teams to redouble their efforts to prioritize the protection of Americans in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Our Nation's governors also discussed the unprecedented support President Trump has provided for the National Guard by extending Title 32 Status for 49 States to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery through August 21, 2020 and continuing the 100% Federal cost share. Best practices from governors highlighted on today's briefing included (full listhere): Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida highlighted efforts to distribute personal protective equipment to nursing homes early on, increasing reimbursement in nursing homes to serve COVID-19 patients, and deploying a mobile RV unit to test nursing home residents and workers.Governor Greg Abbott of Texas highlighted efforts to inspect over 90% of nursing homes' infectious disease protocols and utilizing the Texas National Guard personnel in support of nursing facilities disinfection.Governor Jared Polis of Colorado highlighted efforts by his Care Facility Task Force that has completed 747 out of 747 infection control surveys nursing homes across Colorado.Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has led nearly 300 briefings , including 22 governors' briefings , with over 123,000 State, local, and Tribal participants.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1428846/readout-from-the-vice-presidents-governors-briefing-on-covid-19-response-recovery&speechType=6	Health and Health Care			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/readout-vice-presidents-governors-briefing-covid-19-response-recovery/
VSMP126202010	Mike Pence	2020-06-12	Remarks by Vice President Pence in a Listening Session with Faith and Community Leaders	statement	"Well, Bishop Garlington, thank you for those inspiring words. Thank you to Covenant Church, to the judge, and to the pastors and friends who are here. As Bishop Garlington just said, I'm here to listen. And I'm looking forward, as I know Senator Toomey is, to gaining your insights about how we , we continue to move our nation forward in the aftermath of the tragic death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. I mean, there was no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. And President Trump has made it clear that justice will be served. I know I speak for people across this country when I say there's also no excuse for the violence and the rioting and the looting that took place here in the Pittsburgh area and all across the country. And we commend the leadership at the national level and state and local level and our law enforcement community that quelled that violence and allowed the peaceful protests to continue. As I said, the death of George Floyd was a national tragedy. And it's brought us to a moment where the President and I are intent on listening and learning, not just how we might equip people that serve in law enforcement with more tools and more training in the days ahead, but how we also might deal with some of the historic underlying inequities that have beset minority communities, particularly the African American community, for generations in our major cities. And let me say, you know, one thing that we will not do is we're not going to defund the police. My uncle was a police officer in Chicago, Illinois, for his entire career. And, Bishop, I know I speak for millions of Americans when I say we know that most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement in this country are the best of us. They walk out of their homes every day, leave their families behind. They risk their lives to protect and serve our families, and they have our thanks. But I'm pleased to report to you: In recent days, the President and I have been sitting down with law enforcement leaders in Washington, D.C. and from around the country to hear about ways that that we might assist law enforcement in raising standards, particularly with regard to the use of force, providing additional training resources. And the President, in Dallas yesterday, announced that he'd be signing an executive order in the days ahead that would support efforts by police departments around the country to meet the very highest standards and to be trained in de-escalation efforts. And so we'll work with law enforcement, respecting the extraordinary role and sacrifices that men and women on the Thin Blue Line make every day. We'll work with them and work with community leaders to identify ways that we can improve. But let me also say that we're not going to stop there. The President yesterday spoke about the progress we have made over the last three years. I'm proud to have been part of an administration that saw the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African Americans. My friend and colleague from the White House, Scott Turner, was tapped by President Trump to lead our effort to create Opportunity Zones in cities around the country , now more than 4,000 Opportunity Zones that are , that have attracted literally billions of dollars in investment to create jobs. I want to thank Senator Toomey for his strong support and work with Senator Tim Scott in bringing those reforms about. As the President said, we're going to work on building on that record of success. We're going to , we're going to look for ways that we can , we can give African American businesses greater access to capital to create jobs and opportunities in communities that, for too long, were left behind, even in times of economic growth. The President also spoke yesterday of our continued determination to expand educational choice in this country. The truth is the African American community has been years ahead of the broader population in understanding the justice behind allowing parents to choose where their children go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial, or religious school. The African American community has led in this cause, and President Trump and I have been proud to oversee a doubling of the school choice program in the District of Columbia, and we're going to work to expand educational choice opportunities for minority families, African American families, in the days ahead. And finally, in my role as lead of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, all of us, with real heartbreak, have observed the consequences of historic disparities in healthcare between African Americans and other minorities and in the broader population, and we're going to address that. We're going to address it with the kind of reforms that expand the kind of choices and access to healthcare that our minority communities have. And so, Bishop, I'm , I'm grateful. I'm grateful for your hospitality today. My prayer coming into today was just to have ears to hear, and eyes to see, how we might work together. But I want to , I want to assure you, on behalf of the President of the United States, that for the progress that we've made in expanding prosperity and respecting religious liberty and respecting the values that we cherish in churches just like this one around the country, we're , we're going to do our level best to seize this moment, not just to ensure law and order and make sure that we have , we have justice for every American and that our law enforcement community has the resources they need to do their job, improve in the way they do their job every day, but we're also going to look , we're also going to look to seize on this moment, as you said from that movie, ""Equalizer 2,"" which I , (laughs) , there's , you're the first pastor I've met that said that was his favorite movie. (Laughter.) But if you haven't seen it, I wouldn't be surprised. There's a lot of , a lot of truth in that movie. And we're going to try and seize this as , as you said, as an opportunity. The President and I are absolutely determined justice is served, we have law and order, we support law enforcement, we look for ways to improve. But we are absolutely determined to work with you, the great leaders that are gathered around here and people around the country, to find ways in the long term that we can make progress on some historic inequities, particularly impacting our African American communities and our cities, in jobs, in opportunity, in education, and in healthcare. And I thank you for the opportunity to come and to hear how we can best do that together.

VSMP126202011	Mike Pence	2020-06-12	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Oberg Industries employees on Opening up America Again	statement	Well, thank you all for that very warm welcome, and hello, Pennsylvania! (Applause.) It is great to be back in the Keystone State. And I'm very humbled by the words of Administrator Verma. She is an incredible public servant. And as we as we walked through this amazing factory, saw your craftsmanship in high relief, I can tell you that Seema Verma, leading the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Service, knows the quality of the work that you do and is making those products available to people all across America. Would you join me in thanking Seema Verma for her outstanding service to America? (Applause.) And it's great to be here with all of you. Thank you for coming out today. Thank you for making some time. More importantly, thank you for being a great American company , a company that is supporting our military; supplying our healthcare professionals; and a company that, through one of the most challenging times in my lifetime, you kept the work going, you operated as an essential service. Join me in thanking a great American manufacturing company, Oberg Industry, and your great leader, Cliff Forrest. Thank you so much. (Applause.) It really is inspiring to be in this impressive plant and know that each and every day, as our nation passed through these challenging days, you came to work and provided excellent, excellent resources and products at the point of the need. So I want to thank you. I want to thank you on our behalf, but let me also extend thanks and greetings from a friend of mine , a man who loves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I told him this morning that I was headed to the Keystone State, and, to be honest with you, I thought he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it really is a privilege to be here on the President's behalf today, not just to say thank you, but to be out among people across the Pittsburgh area today. I'd even stopped at David's Diner for maybe the best Reuben I've ever had in my life. But I'm here to tell you, Pennsylvania: A great American comeback has begun, and you're leading the way. (Applause.) As I stand before you today, every state in America has already begun to reopen for business, and nearly three quarters of America's small businesses have also begun to reopen. Building on a strong foundation that this President laid over the last three years that saw the creation of more than 7 million jobs, following our efforts to cut taxes, roll back regulation, fight for free and fair trade, and unleash American energy, I'm proud to report to you that, on this day one week ago, the President and I stood in the Rose Garden, and we're proud to announce that in the month of May, thanks to hardworking Americans like all of you, our nation saw the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history. (Applause.) It's true. You know, I got to tell you, I was , I was preparing to be on television that morning, and I was hearing what all the economists were predicting. They were all talking about the fact that they thought we might lose 8 million more jobs in these challenging times and that the unemployment rate might go up to 20 percent. But the American people proved them wrong, and businesses large and small created more than 3 million jobs by the middle of May alone. (Applause.) And we're going to continue to move forward. I was talking to some economic experts over the last week, and they said that at the time that that jobs report came out, that, Cliff, only about 50 percent of small businesses in those first few weeks of May had begun to reopen. And now, according to the U.S. Chamber, we estimate that more than 80 percent of small businesses are open to one degree or another. And so, for all the encouragement of those numbers , a great testament to the resilience and faith and hard work of the American people , we're very confident that it's just the beginning, and this American comeback has just begun. It's true. (Applause.) And we're going to do all the things that made this economy great over the last three and a half years , created millions of jobs. And let me also say from my heart, we're going to make law and order a centerpiece of the great American comeback. (Applause.) Let me say from my heart: What happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis was a tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation. And President Trump has made it clear: Justice will be served. (Applause.) There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. And there's also no excuse for rioting and looting and the violence that ensued here in Pittsburgh and around the country. Now, every American cherishes our First Amendment rights. And we respect the concerns and freedoms of peaceful protesters. And I want to promise each one of you that we're , as we did today at a church in the Pittsburgh area, as the President did yesterday in Dallas , we're going to continue to listen. We're going to have ears to hear, we're going to learn, and we're going to lead. But we're not going to defund the police. (Applause.) I think all of you know: Most of the men and women who serve in law enforcement every single day who put on the uniform, who stand on the Thin Blue Line are really the best of us. I grew up , one of the heroes of my youth was my uncle, who was a Chicago police officer for 25 years. So we're working today, in the aftermath of that , that tragic death of George Floyd. We're sitting down with law enforcement leaders at every level around the country, and we're working with community leaders, as we did today. As the President announced yesterday, we're in the process of , of drafting executive action that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the highest standards in the use of force, to have more resources for training and de-escalation. But I want to tell you all here in Pennsylvania: We're not going to stop there. I mean, the truth is that many African American families in our major cities, for more than a half a century, have labored under failed policies of liberal Democratic leadership, depriving them of jobs and opportunities and education excellence. That's why, yesterday, President Trump made it clear that we're going to work with law enforcement and community leaders to find ways that we can improve , give them more tools and more resources. But we're going to work , we're going to work to expand jobs and opportunities and education excellence for African American families and all the families of our major cities. (Applause.) As the President has said, we're going to build on the progress we've made. I couldn't be more proud to tell you that, as we saw those 7 million jobs created in the last three and a half years, we have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. And this President actually passed legislation with my friend, Senator Tim Scott, that created more than 4,000 Opportunity Zones that have already attracted more than $100 billion of job-creating investments in our major cities. In fact, with , with some of that foundation at work, in that last jobs report I just mentioned, there were more than 300,000 jobs created in that May report for African Americans alone. We're going to increase African American communities' access to capital, build on the Opportunity Zones, and help them create more jobs. But it's not just about jobs; it's also about making sure that young people coming up have access to the kind of education, including vocational training, that they need to enter jobs in great workplaces like this and to be part of a growing economy. I mean, the truth is that the President and I are going to keep working every single day to give African American families in our cities and every family the right to choose where their children go to school, whether that's a public or private or parochial or religious school. So it's about education innovation. It's about prosperity and jobs. But also, one of the things we learn during Seema and my work on the Coronavirus Task Force was the unique and more severe impact of that virus on African Americans in our country. And it was really a reflection of the fact that we have health disparities for many African American families in our inner cities. So the President also said yesterday that our team is going to be working , we're going to be working to bring free market principles and solutions to allow African American families to have access to the same world-class healthcare that every American deserves. And so it's about , it's about reform, it's about public safety, but it's about prosperity and education and healthcare. And we are not going to rest until we continue the work that we make this a more perfect union. And together, we open America up again for the prosperity of all of our citizens. (Applause.) But I'm here to talk about the great American comeback. And the truth is, it wouldn't be possible today. It wouldn't be possible today without the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, and the cooperation and compassion of the American people, or the ingenuity and hard work of all the companies like this one that kept food on the table, kept important medical devices headed to our healthcare system, and you kept America moving in the most challenging times. But it was the President's leadership early on , I can tell you, as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force , that bought us invaluable time. It was not even before the month of January was over that President Trump suspended all travel from China. He put the health of America first. It's true. (Applause.) He stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force. We worked with companies, just like this one, at an unprecedented level. You know, when the President asked me to do this work at the end of February, he said to me that he wanted a whole-of-government approach, but it was very clear to me early on what he really wanted was a whole-of-America approach. The President brought in major industries, pharmaceutical industries to begin the research on new medicines and vaccines. He brought in , he brought in industries that would be in the process of creating medical equipment and supplies. I mean, with what we stood up, at an unprecedented level, almost on a wartime footing in this country, was extraordinary to watch. In fact, I'm proud to report to you that just in Pennsylvania alone, at the President's direction, we were able to deliver more than 660 million masks and gowns and face shields and other personal protective equipment for our outstanding healthcare workers. (Applause.) And maybe , maybe most meaningful to us all is as we , as we looked overseas where the coronavirus was impacting countries, particularly in Europe, we saw hospitals being overwhelmed. We saw people being denied access to equipment, like ventilators. But because of the energetic efforts that the President deployed and because of American industry, I'm proud to report to you that no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. That's a national accomplishment. (Applause.) We made sure our healthcare workers and the people that they were serving and those families had what they needed in the moment, through the most difficult days of this pandemic. And we've also been expanding testing across the board. Again, it was early in the process that the President recognized that the old way of doing testing for this kind of illness was simply not going to scale to the volume that we would need. He brought in these vast commercial laboratories. He challenged them to begin to work together. In fact, when I was tapped at the end of February to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, between the CDC and state public health labs, we'd only done about 8,000 coronavirus tests. As of this morning, more than 22 million tests have been performed all across the United States of America. It's an extraordinary expansion of access to testing. From the outset of this pandemic, the American people have responded, have stepped up, made great personal sacrifices , each of us did, in our own families. I mean, it's worked a great hardship on our people, but it was an example of the American people's willingness to put the health of others first, of family members, of neighbors, of coworkers, and even people that they had never met. So all of the American people did what needed to be done through those 45 days. And chief among them were the people that use the products that you make here at this great company. And I want to tell you, you've , you've been on your feet once, but would you mind getting on your feet for all the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, and first responders who took care of our families as if they were their own, under the most challenging circumstances imaginable. (Applause.) It's just truly astonishing to see the way healthcare workers across this country stepped up. They and millions of Americans did what needed to be done, whether it was work from home, school your kids at home, or give some space to seniors in your family or in your neighborhood that would be most vulnerable to the worst outcomes. Some closed down businesses. I'm , I'm proud to say that that we were able, over this time, to provide businesses large and small across this country with the resources that , that they needed to get through this difficult time. The Paycheck Protection Program that the President just extended one week ago has made it possible for many small businesses to keep people on the payroll and avoid losing vital momentum in their companies and in their workers. The truth is, because of what we all did together as a nation, we slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives. And every single day we're one day closer to putting this coronavirus in the past. Now, for all that we've accomplished there are some great partners all along the way. Seema mentioned that we forged a partnership with governors all across this nation. We speak to them every single week , don't we? , on an ongoing basis about our national response. But I must tell you that the relief efforts that the Congress of the United States forged in a bipartisan manner were in the highest keeping of public service. The President said early on: We want people to have access to family leave; we wanted to make sure there was direct payments for families that were impacted by the coronavirus; support for businesses large and small, critical industries, healthcare workers, and first responders. And leaders in Congress responded. And three of them are with us here today, and I'd like you to give a vigorous round of applause to three great friends of mine, great friends of the President, and great partners in the progress that we have made: Congressman G.T. Thompson, Congressman Mike Kelly, and Congressman Guy Reschenthaler. (Applause.) Thank you so much for what you did for Pennsylvania and for America. (Applause.) Great job. Because of what they've done, because of what you've done, because of the leadership the President provided, as I said at the outset, now all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible manner, even while continuing practices that keep our families and communities safe, practicing good hygiene. We're going back to work. We're going back to worship. We're getting out to stores, to restaurants , like the one I dined at today , and we're enjoying the great outdoors, after going without what we once took for granted for so long. We're also putting American manufacturing back to work. You know, the truth is, from the earliest days of our administration, this President has fought for manufacturing workers and companies just like this one, like the 700 employees at Oberg Industries here in Pennsylvania. You know, and this is a , this company is emblematic of a great community, but a great manufacturing tradition. You know, I come from the state of Indiana, and Pennsylvania is an awful lot like Indiana in a certain respect. I always used to say we do two things well out this way: We make things, and we grow things. And this is a great example of a great company that proves that every single day. And the truth is, under the President's policies of the last three and a half years, manufacturing is doing better than ever before, including this great company. I'm actually told, in 2018, when Cliff bought this company, he set a new record for sales. And then, in 2019, they broke the record again. Congratulations, Oberg Industries. That's an impressive record of success , (applause) , and I think they're going to break it again. I mean, and the work you do here is impressive. Walking around the plant floor, I was incredibly inspired by the skill and the craftsmanship and the enthusiasm of every one of the employees here that I met. This company plays a critical role in supporting the health of our nation and the security of our country. You make the tooling for aluminum cans that have protected the food supply all throughout this pandemic. You make parts that are critical for knee replacements, hip replacements, neck and back surgeries that Center for Medicaid Medicare Services makes available to Americans every single day. And I'm also told that Oberg's Pennsylvania workers make parts that are used in ammunition for our troops, for the Abrams A1 tank, the Ohio-class nuclear submarines, and the F-15. Thanks for helping to provide for the common defense, Oberg. (Applause.) And I'm a little bit partial, Cliff, to people that help out with aircraft. I'm proud to say that I am the proud father of a Marine Corps aviator and the proud father-in-law of a Navy pilot. And so we appreciate your professionalism. (Applause.) And speaking of great people in uniform, I just had lunch at David's Diner with another one, a good friend of mine and a great friend of the people of Pennsylvania, and a great citizen of this state. He's a veteran of the 10th Mountain Division. He earned two Bronze Stars. He received a Purple Heart for wounds suffered in combat in Afghanistan. He's a proud son of Pittsburgh, and he has become one of the most prominent advocates for veterans in the United States of America today. So would you join me in recognizing and appreciating a lifetime of service of Sean Parnell? Sean, thank you for being here. (Applause.) Sean, thank you for your leadership , past, present, and future. You know, Oberg Industries has been supporting our troops not just with your products, but also through your extraordinary apprenticeship program. I was hearing about it from one of your employees , a bright, young man. More than 40 percent of Oberg's Pennsylvania employees are graduates of that apprenticeship program. And I hope you know that our administration has been working to expand access to apprenticeships and vocational education from day one. It's such a great program that one of your toolmaking apprentices actually stayed with the company, I'm told, for more than 28 years and worked his way up to be the CEO. Would you join me in giving a round of applause for Mark Paolillo. Where are you, Mark? (Applause.) He's hiding out. I'm told we're actually joined today by some 60 apprentices of this company, including a Marine Corporal by the name of Caleb Baum and an Army Corporal named Ron Cooper Junior. Give them a round of applause, will you? (Applause.) Where are you guys? Take a bow, men. Stand up. Thank you for your service. And congratulations, men. I mean, we're also honored to be joined by a former apprentice here at Oberg Industries, Ron's dad, who's a former Air Force sergeant. Where is Ron Cooper Senior? I want to , hey, Dad. What a great family. These are great Americans , part of a great American company. And we're grateful for your work here and even more grateful for your service in the uniform of the United States of America. Now, there's going to be a lot more apprentices, I'm told, working here in Pennsylvania, because just yesterday, I was informed that Mark decided to join in with our national effort, the Pledge to America's Workers. And they pledge to create another 225 new jobs and apprenticeships in the next five years. So, thank you, Mark. (Applause.) Thank you, Oberg Industries. So we're rolling. We're moving forward. And as this comeback continues, we have every confidence that the best days for Oberg Industries and the best days for Pennsylvania and America are yet to come. And to help create more jobs and prosperity, I'm proud to report to you the President has also gone to work to help our economy out of this difficult time. The President signed executive action ordering every federal agency to find even more ways to provide regulatory relief, particularly for manufacturing all across this country. And we're going to continue to stand for energy independence for the American people. We're going to oppose efforts to ban fracking. And the war on coal is over. (Applause.) Here in Western Pennsylvania and everywhere, we're going to continue to fight every day to advance American energy independence. But it's great to be with you today. I hope to have a chance to come down and at least greet some of you before I slip back to Washington, D.C. But I had to come out today to talk about a great American comeback but also just to thank all of you , all of you good people , that have kept this vital, essential company rolling during some of the most challenging times in the life for our nation. And now, other businesses large and small are joining you as we reopen America. It seems like we've passed through a very challenging time over the last few months and weeks. And I know, at times, it may seem like there's more that divides us in this nation than any time in my lifetime, but I must tell you , and I saw this at a church in Pittsburgh today , I'll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in this great country than could ever divide us, and chief among those things is faith. (Applause.) And so, as I close, I would just say to each one of you that, if you're of a mind to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I'd encourage you to do it. Pray for the more than 110,000 families that have lost loved ones, and maybe some are sitting are among us today. You'll always be on our hearts and in our prayers. Pray for all of the people of this country who have suffered hardship over the last several months. And pray , pray that as we listen to one another, that as we look for ways to improve the prosperity and wellbeing and opportunities for every American regardless of race, or creed, or color, that we would continue to bring our nation together on that foundation. I heard it from pastors today at the Covenant Church, one after another, who said: During these challenging times, we need to , we need to reach out to that wellspring of American strength that's seen us through much more challenging times, even than those that we passed through this year. We can claim that promise that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like he's always done for the long and storied history of this nation: He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. So let's pray for America as we open up America, because the best is yet to come. Thank you all very much. God bless you. (Applause.) God bless Pennsylvania and God bless America.

VSMP16620209	Mike Pence	2020-06-16	Remarks by Vice President Pence to Winnebago Industries Employees	statement	"Well, hello, Iowa! (Applause.) It is great to be in Iowa on this beautiful June day, to see all of you out in the sunshine. Would you join me in just thanking Governor Kim Reynolds and her husband, Kevin, for the incredible work that they do for the people of Iowa every day? (Applause.) That's a great leader. To Governor Reynolds, to Mayor Barney Ruiter, and to the first woman ever elected to the Iowa House of Representatives, Speaker Linda Upmeyer , (applause) , it is great to be back in the Hawkeye State as this state and America make a transition to greatness! (Applause.) And I really appreciate you all being here. I appreciate the warm welcome , the especially warm welcome. I really do. And I appreciate your inspiring example at this great company. More on that in a minute. I mean, to be here at an American company that, for 60 years, has kept America on the move is incredibly inspiring. I know you had to shut down, but you opened right back up. You put people back to work, and you got America back on the road. Let's hear it for Mike Happe and all the men and women of Winnebago, Iowa. (Applause.) And before I begin, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine , a man who loves the state of Iowa, who's actually the best friend of American manufacturing has ever had. And he even said the other day that he and Melania might just buy an RV real soon. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump! (Applause.) It really is a joy to be here on the President's behalf today, as we begin this transition to greatness. You know, as I stand before you today, I'm proud to report that, after the difficult times through which we have passed as a nation, that today, every state in this country and nearly three-quarters of America's small businesses have already begun to reopen. (Applause.) We're opening up America again, and you're part of that story. And we're building on the strong foundation of the first three years of this administration. After we cut taxes, rolled back regulations, fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, supported American ethanol, we saw 7 million jobs created by businesses large and small. And on that foundation, once we started to open up America , you might have seen it a little more than a week ago , in the month of May, the people of America saw the largest one-month increase in job creation in American history , 2.5 million jobs added to our economy. (Applause.) I mean, I can't think of a greater example of America's resilience and strength than those numbers. I mean, the expert economists were all telling us that, in that report, that we would likely lose up to 8 million jobs. And they said that unemployment, Governor, was likely going to go from 14 percent, maybe up to 20 percent. But the American people proved them wrong. And businesses large and small created two and a half million jobs. And I don't know if you heard about it yet, but just this morning, after economists predicted that retail sales would increase by maybe 8 percent for the month of May, the American people shattered expectations again. Retail sales in America soared to 17.7 percent , the largest monthly increase ever recorded. (Applause.) America is going back to work! (Applause.) The recovery is on, and we're going to make our economy strong again , I promise you , on the same agenda that created millions of jobs over the past three years. And while I'm here in Iowa, I ought to take the opportunity to say thank you for two stalwart leaders who stood with President Trump and I every step of the way when we were rolling back regulations, when we were standing up for American farmers, when we were cutting taxes, supporting our military. I mean, this state is so well served by the principled conservative leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Joni Ernst. Would you mind showing your appreciation for these two outstanding leaders? (Applause.) They supported our agenda every step of the way of less taxes, less regulation, and strong support every day for the American farmer. I mean, you all saw the effects of the agenda that we've advanced right here at Winnebago. I'm told, after the President signed that tax cut a couple of years ago, Winnebago actually donated a million dollars to charity and gave thousands of you employees a well-deserved bonus. It was great corporate leadership. And on that foundation of growth , that generosity, that compassion, that ingenuity , we're driving a great American comeback. And as I stand before you today, I promise you: A centerpiece of our transition to greatness is going to be law and order. (Applause.) Let me say from my heart: What happened to George Floyd was a tragedy and a disgrace. It should have never happened. It shocked the conscience of our nation. There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that has ensued. (Applause.) Like every American, we cherish our First Amendment. We respect the concerns of peaceful protesters. And we're going to listen, we're going to learn, and we're going to lead. But we're not going to defund the police. (Applause.) I mean, you all here at Winnebago know, and people in Iowa know: Most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best of us. They're the best this country has to offer. But over the past several weeks, President Trump and I have been taking time, in this challenging national moment, to listen. We sat down with leaders in law enforcement. We've sat down with leaders in the African American community. As the President said today from the Rose Garden, we are one nation. We grieve together and we heal together. And today, after listening and learning, President Trump signed an executive order that will make immediate resources and training available to police departments across America to improve standards for the use of force, de-escalation, and accountability. (Applause.) We're going to help our police improve. And I know Governor Kim Reynolds brought about a unanimously passed piece of legislation she signed on the steps of your state capitol just last Friday, creating more oversight and more accountability. And I want to thank you, Governor, for your compassionate leadership, your support for law enforcement, and for bringing Iowa together. (Applause.) But I can tell you: We're going to support law enforcement, and we're going to support our African American communities with resources and reform. But we're not going to stop there. As President Trump said in Dallas, we're going to move an agenda that promotes public safety, but we're also going to keep moving an agenda that promotes jobs, prosperity, and greater educational opportunities for all our minority communities in cities across this country , (applause) , just like we did over the last three years, which saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans; that saw this President create more than 8,000 Opportunity Zones in communities across the country, attracting billions of dollars of investment. We're going to work to bring jobs and investment to underserved communities. We're going to address the healthcare disparities that we learned especially about during the coronavirus pandemic. We're going to bring market solutions to give our minority communities more choices in their healthcare. And we're going to keep fighting every single day to give our African American families and every family the right to choose where their children go to school , a public, private, or parochial school. It'll be the parents' choice. (Applause.) And I'm very confident, even in these challenging times, that we'll do what Americans have always done: We'll form a more perfect union. And together, we'll move our nation forward. Together, we'll put Americans back to work. And together, we were , we will open up America again. It's happening before our eyes. (Applause.) You know, the comeback that we celebrate today would not have been possible without your hard work and determination. But let me also say, it would not have been possible without the leadership of President Donald Trump in partnership with governors and with the American people. You know, before we had a single coronavirus case in this country, this President shut down all travel from China. It bought us invaluable time to stand up our national response. You know, it's remarkable to think, at the end of February, when he asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd actually performed less than 8,000 coronavirus tests in the entire country. But today, we're testing roughly 60 times that number every single day. We've performed more than 23 million tests , more than anywhere in the world. That's American ingenuity at work. (Applause.) And let me take this opportunity to also commend your governor. Governor Kim Reynolds has already tested nearly a quarter of a million people through the Test Iowa program. In her tireless efforts, she's put the health of Iowans first. And Iowa has been setting the pace , setting the pace in the progress that we've made in this pandemic and opening up this great state again. Governor, thank you again for your leadership and your example. (Applause.) In addition to testing, we've been giving states what they need when they need it. That included more than 158 million masks and gowns and face shields and personal protective equipment here in Iowa alone. And thanks to that same ingenuity and hard work of American manufacturing, I'm proud to tell you: No American with coronavirus who ever needed a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. That's a national accomplishment. (Applause.) And from the outset of this pandemic, the American people made great personal sacrifices to protect the health of their family, their neighbors, and people that they never knew. And our doctors and nurses and healthcare workers and first responders rendered care to our families as if they were their own. Why don't we give them a round of applause? We've got heroes. We've got heroes in our hospitals and heroes in our first responders. (Applause.) But it was millions of Americans , you all made the sacrifices as well , stayed home from work, home from school, away from places of worship so cherished. Some closed down businesses that took a lifetime to build. And here at Winnebago, you did more than your part. Volunteers from this company, I'm told, made 36,000 masks that were manufactured for hospitals in Iowa. And you've also created face shields at this plant and distributed them to healthcare workers and first responders all across the state. Give yourselves a round of applause. That is , that's America. (Applause.) And I want to recognize, particularly, a craftsman here I'm told has worked at Winnebago, Iowa, for 25 years. He's created wooden cabinetry that vehicles are known for, even building prototype designs. But he's the one who worked with a team of manufacturers. He used, I'm told, a 3D printing machine to make face shields, donated them to local hospitals. So would you all join me in thanking somebody who volunteered his energy, his creativity, and made a difference in the lives of the people of this state? Where are you, Rod White? Let's hear it for Rod White. (Applause.) Stand up, Rod. Great job. Great job, Rod. Thank you, Rod. Thanks for bringing your talents to this moment, and thank you all for responding. You know, because of the hard work , because of the hard work of people like Rod and because of all of you, we met this moment. We met this moment, not just with the whole-of-Amer, whole-of-government response, but we met it with a whole-of-America response. The American people stepped forward, just like you all did. And it's a demonstration of the resilience and the faith and the resolve of our people. You know, thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Governor Kim Reynolds and all the good people of the Hawkeye State, I'm proud to report to you, here and across America, we slowed the spread. We flattened the curve. We saved lives. And that's why we're opening up America again. You did it. (Applause.) And as I said at the start, now all 50 states have begun to reopen in a safe and responsible way. You know, even before we got through those 45 Days to Slow the Spread, the President had us issue guidelines to give counsel to governors like yours about how a phased reopening could work, to strengthen the economy while protecting the health of our families and while continuing the practices that keep our families and communities safe. People are going back to work. They're going back to worship. We're getting back to our , to our lives. And the American people should be proud. We're going back to stores, going back to restaurants. And with the help from the men and women of Winnebago, we're also enjoying the great outdoors, I'm told, like almost never before. We're putting American manufacturing back to work. I know since May 4th, you all have been working hard, you've been maintaining your social distancing, doing your daily health checks. You've been taking care of your neighbors and your coworkers, you've been putting the healthier neighbors first. And it's a remarkable example that you've set here , remarkable example: 5,500 strong men and women of Winnebago are emblematic of manufacturing workers all across America who are the backbone of this economy. Like a senior machine setup operator who, I'm told, started working here right out of high school so he could save up for trade school. But he realized he liked working here so much he changed his plans and just decided to stay. I'm told his brother, Mark, works here too; so does his wife Carla. And on September 8th, he'll celebrate 50 years with this incredible company. Would you join me in showing our thanks and admiration to Glen Blazer and his whole family? (Applause.) Where are you, Glen? Stand up. Take a bow, Glen. Fifty years. (Applause.) Congratulations, Glen. Awesome. I did the math. You know, Glen must have started here after this place has been going about 10 years, and you've been here ever since. You made an incredible difference. And you helped set the pace for a company that's making a great difference, not only in this community, not only in this state, but all across the nation. You know, I was just told by some of the leadership here at the company that Americans are buying RVs at a pretty rapid pace. In fact, usually, I think we heard that roughly about a third of buyers every year are first-time buyers; it's pushing more like 50 percent. America is hitting the road in American-made RVs , (applause) , and you all should be proud that you made it happen. I mean, think about it: This President has said gas prices are low, summer is almost here. What better time to go see America in a great RV? You know, so it's great to be back in the Hawkeye State to be able to talk about this great American comeback, but also to just say thank you , and not just on behalf of the President of the United States, but just on behalf of a grateful nation. It's men and women like you, and companies like this, that are keeping America rolling, are getting America rolling again. I mean, it was , it was companies in essential industries that literally never stopped, and companies like this one , like Rod did , who transformed themselves to be a part of the solution for our healthcare workers and for our families. In one of the most challenging times in the life of our nation, it was the people who make things and the people who grow things who stepped up. And so I'm proud to be able to be here to pay a debt of gratitude to each and every one of you, just to say thank you for what you've done. You know, it seems like, these days, you turn on the television that it seems like there's more that divides us these days than has ever been true in my lifetime. But, you know, I actually think otherwise. I think there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than could ever divide us, and chief among those virtues is a love of freedom and the faith of the American people. (Applause.) I mean, the way that the people of Iowa and people across this country have stepped up, kept doing the right things , practicing hygiene and social distancing but getting back to work, getting back to their lives, getting back out and supporting all those great, local businesses , affirms my belief that this is a freedom-loving nation. We love our freedom, and we know how to use it with commonsense and care for others. But I also know, as the President often says, that this is a nation of faith. I hear it everywhere I go. I was at Sally's Restaurant , try the hamburger. (Laughter.) She opened up today for the first time since the pandemic struck. (Applause.) You know, as I walked around Sally's Restaurant, I had more than a few people say those words that I hear just about everywhere I go in America, and that is: When people look at you and they lower their voice a little bit and they just say, ""I'm praying for you."" And you always know when people mean it, when it comes from their heart. And so let me just say, as I close, that if you're , if you're inclined to bow the head and bend the knee from time to time, I encourage you to do that during these challenging times. (Applause.) And I'm always humbled when people pray for us with those of us that have public responsibilities. But on this one, I , I'd like you to pray for the more than 116,000 families that have lost loved ones. The Bible says, ""The Lord is close to the brokenhearted,"" and I'd just remember them sometime this week in your prayers. Pray for all of those who have labor to provide care month after month, who've looked after our loved ones in hospitals, oftentimes taking the place of family that couldn't be with them because of the strictures of the contagion of the coronavirus. So pray for our healthcare workers and all those that have been alongside. And in these times of national challenge, I just also encourage you to pray for America. Pray for all the people of America and claim those ancient words that if His people, who are called by his name, will humble themselves and pray, you can believe that He'll do like He's always done in much more challenging times: He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Applause.) So thank you, Winnebago. Thank you, Iowa. God bless you for all that you have done at this great company. God bless this state, and God bless America in this great American comeback. (Applause.)

VSMP25620208	Mike Pence	2020-06-25	Remarks by Vice President Pence on Opening Up America Again	statement	"Well, hello, Ohio! That might be the first time I've ever driven up onstage. (Laughter.) And what a beautiful vehicle to do it in. To Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette , he's doing an incredible job for the United States of America. Would you give our Secretary a big round of applause? It's so great that he's here in Voltage Valley. (Applause.) To Mayor Arno Hill, thank you for your warm welcome, for your great local leadership. Legendary coach Jim Tressel. And above all, my seatmate: Steve Burns and the men and women of Lordstown Motors. (Applause.) What a great day in the Buckeye State. (Applause.) You know, it really is an honor to be here, to be able to drive up and help unveil what will soon be the first fully electric pickup truck on the market in the United States of America. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: the Lordstown Endurance. (Applause.) It's beautiful. And I got to tell you: It's a nice ride. (Laughter.) And I'm a truck guy. (Laughter.) I'm currently between trucks right now, but I'm looking. So , but this is , this is just a great day. It's an exciting day. From a time, not too long ago, where we had heartbreaking news, today is a new beginning for Lordstown, and it's a new day of leadership in electric vehicles in the United States. (Applause.) It really is great to be with all of you. And on my way here today, I got a phone call as soon as I landed from a friend of mine. He heard I was headed to Ohio, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) He's a man who loves the State of Ohio, and he has been the best friend that automotive manufacturing has ever had in the Oval Office. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) And we just love the Mahoning Valley. I mean, one of the very first campaign stops I made was at the Canfield Fair in 2016, not too far from here. We had just a few people that came out , that would be tens of thousands of people that came out. It was probably the best-attended country fair I ever attended in my life. But I saw the enthusiasm then. I knew that people , I knew that people all across the Valley knew that in that candidate , a man who would become President of the United States , you'd have someone who would fight for jobs and fight for American workers. And today is one more example of President Trump's commitment to make American manufacturing great again. (Applause.) And I want to thank all the distinguished guests who are here with us today. You know, they , working with Senator Rob Portman; working with your great governor, Governor Mike DeWine; and others, this President went to work. Right after the people of Ohio said yes, three and a half years ago, we cut taxes across the board for working families and for small businesses. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history. We unleashed American energy and the kind of energy innovation that you're going to see in the Valley now for decades to come. We fought for free and fair trade and the values and ideals that have always made this country great. And on every single promise, President Trump delivered for the people of Ohio and the people of America. (Applause.) And, you know, that's especially true when it comes to automotive jobs and to manufacturing. From the first day of our administration, the President said he was going to put free and fair trade , trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first , back at the center of American policy. We put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over. We stood strong for American jobs and American workers against China. And thanks to the President's leadership, in just a few weeks, it'll be official: NAFTA is gone, and the USMCA will soon be the law of the land. (Applause.) And it puts American manufacturing, American workers first. I mean, if you didn't know it, under the USMCA, 75 percent of all automotive parts have to be made here in North America. And 40 percent of automotive parts must be made by workers making an average hourly wage , essentially, the average hourly wage in the United States. That's how we're doing it, folks. That's how we have taken the incentive that was in NAFTA to move jobs south of the border , that's all gone. We're going to keep automotive jobs growing right here in Ohio and right here across the United States. (Applause.) And if you think back on it , the first three years of the administration , the results really speak for themselves. We saw businesses large and small create more than 7 million jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs, of which 48,000 new automotive jobs were created in just three years. It was a manufacturing renaissance that was underway. And really, what was most meaningful to the President and me was not just the jobs were being added, but wages were rising. And what was most exciting to us is wages were rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more. (Applause.) And the American Dream was working. It was working again for every American. The President I couldn't be more proud that in our first three years, we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. The American Dream came roaring back under President Donald Trump. It's true. (Applause.) Our economy was on an incredible roll: the stock market setting records, jobs being created, wages rising. And then, as we all know, then came the worst pandemic in 100 years to strike our country from overseas. But in the midst of that, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I can tell you: Every step of the way President Trump exercised the kind of leadership that every American would want , decisive action. I mean, literally before the month of January was out, he stood up a task force bringing a whole-of-government response prepared. But even before the first coronavirus case was transmitted from one American to another, this President suspended all travel from China into the United States of America. He put the health of America first. (Applause.) And I can tell you firsthand , I can tell you firsthand, the President's decisive action , decisive action on that January day bought us invaluable time to stand up a national response. And in that time, from here in Ohio and all across the country, you saw it. The American people produced and delivered hundreds of millions of medical supplies to our incredible healthcare workers in all 50 states. In fact, can we just hear it for our doctors and our nurses and all of the incredible healthcare workers that are working right up to this moment for those struggling with this disease? God bless you all. (Applause.) And we reinvented testing , literally from a standing start. You know, when I was tapped to lead the Coronavirus Task Force in late February, we were using the old system of testing, where you send samples to a state lab or you send them to the CDC. I mean, we'd only done a few thousand tests by the end of February. But because the President brought together massive commercial labs in this country, challenged them to step forward and meet this moment, we're actually testing more than 500,000 Americans every single day, and we'll soon have tested 30 million Americans all across this country. We met the moment. We met the moment with American innovation. (Applause.) And I have to tell you, American manufacturing stepped up in so many ways to meet that moment for those critical medical supplies, but maybe none more important with the way that we saw many of our greatest manufacturing companies step forward and partner with the federal government to produce ventilators at an unprecedented rate. You know, what we'd heard from some countries overseas early on was that many people were succumbing to the coronavirus because they didn't have the equipment like ventilators to see them through the worst of the disease. Well, we were going to make sure that didn't happen in America. And I couldn't be more proud to tell you that thanks to the President's leadership, thanks just to the way American manufacturing stepped up, no American who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. That's a national accomplishment. (Applause.) And we met this moment , we met this moment, I believe, with compassion and ingenuity. We saw , we saw the people across Ohio and across America put the health of their family and their neighbors first in those ""45 days to Slow the Spread."" And the people of Ohio have continued to practice good common sense and good hygiene in the progress that you've made. And because of the foundation that we laid in this economy in those first three years, I'm proud to report to you: As we stand here today, including Ohio, all 50 states have started to open up our economies again. (Applause.) And while you see in the news over the past week or so we have rising cases and outbreaks in several southern states, I want to assure you that our task force and our entire administration is working continuously with leaders in those states to respond. I'll be traveling to Texas and Arizona in just a few days to meet with the governors and health officials there. But I want you to know that it's a testament , it's a testament to the resilience of the American people that, like here in Ohio and beyond, in some 38 states across the country, cases are stable or even declining. And I want to say: The people of Ohio and your Governor, Mike DeWine, have set a standard for the nation. Thank you for leading, Ohio. (Applause.) And with all the American people are doing, we're putting America back to work, and today is one more example of a great American comeback. And the truth is, because of the foundation that we laid in this economy together over the first three years, even as we began to open up America in the month of May, we actually saw the largest one-month increase in jobs in American history: 3 million jobs created. And that was before more than half of small businesses were even open yet. And a lot of economists actually predicted that we would lose 8 million jobs that month, and the unemployment rate might hit 20 percent. But if you didn't hear about it, not only did we create 3 million jobs last month, but the unemployment rate didn't go up to 20 percent. It actually dropped down from 14 percent to 13 percent, and we're continuing to see unemployment claims steadily decline across the country. America is coming back. (Applause.) And we also know the American consumer is out there rolling and getting this economy going. Retail sales soared just a few days ago by 17.7 percent. That was also the largest monthly increase in sales in history. So the recovery is on, which makes it even more timely and more appropriate to be here at Lordstown Motors, a part of the great American comeback. (Applause.) And all of you gathered here today and all of you with great family histories in this community know that this community is a perfect example of the character and the resilience and the faith that's driving an American comeback after all we've been through. I mean, when you think about the storied history of this community, and even this facility, ""Endurance"" isn't just the name of the pickup truck; endurance describes the character of the people of the Mahoning Valley. Give yourselves a round of applause. (Applause.) I mean, in the Mahoning Valley, for more than 50 years, this historic building was used to literally manufacture millions of cars that were sold and driven all over the world. I'm told they made the '66 Impala, the Cavalier, and the Cruze right here. And when this facility closed in March of 2019, it was heartbreaking for this community. That's why, as you all know, President Donald Trump sprung into action. He reached out to General Motors to see if they could find a way to help bring jobs back to Lordstown. He reached out to business leaders. He reached out to your Governor, Mike DeWine; to Senator Rob Portman; to your members of Congress. And on May 8th, the President was delighted to get the call. He called it ""great news for Ohio"" when Steve Burns bought this building and set into motion the plans to create Lordstown Motors. Thank you, Steve. (Applause.) Can we hear it one more time for Steve Burns? Thanks for stepping up , (applause) , and starting a new chapter of history here in Lordstown. (Applause.) And they were walking me through this place, and it's , it's just incredibly impressive. Many of you have history working here. You see the incredible assets. But they're retooling it. They're retooling this historic facility. I met with a lot of the engineers that designed this vehicle, and I met with the team that's retooling this to manufacture these electric pickup trucks. And soon, you're going to continue that Mahoning Valley tradition of world-class auto manufacturers. American workers are going to turn to American steel, with American trucks made right here in Lordstown. You know, back when I was governor of the state of Indiana, I used to say, ""Out here, in the Heartland, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things."" And thanks to the resilience of this community, thanks to the innovation represented here today, once again, Lordstown is going to be back big time in the ""make things"" business, and you're going to make history right here at Lordstown Motors. I believe it with all my heart. (Applause.) I mean, the truth is you all know what the President and I know: is that manufacturing workers are the backbone of America's economy. And here in the Valley, you have some of the very best in the world. On the way here, I was reading about a few of them, like a man who spent more than 30 years in the auto industry after he spent 14 years in the United States Navy as an electronics technician. He was eight years on a nuclear submarine. And today, he's going to be the Director of Central Maintenance here at Lordstown Motors. Would you join me in thanking him for his service to America and his leadership in this company? John Ritter, thank you so much. (Applause.) Where are you, John? Thanks you, John. And thanks for your service, John. We're truly grateful in the United States Navy. You know, my unworthy son-in-law is a lieutenant in the United States Navy , (laughter) , so we're proud of him and grateful for you. I also heard about a man I met just moments ago, who came to this country as a refugee after he heard a speech by my second favorite president, Ronald Reagan. He spent more than 20 years in the auto industry. He's worked his way up to the top management positions in three major companies. He truly loves this country. He's lived the American Dream. So would you join me in congratulating John Vo for his great, great leadership and his extraordinary contributions to this community? Thank you, John. (Applause.) But I mention John Ritter and John Vo because they're really emblematic of all of you , all of you in this community and all of you who are involved with Lordstown Motors today and will be involved in the years ahead. The truth is you are leading a comeback here in Lordstown. You're leading it on the basis of character and resilience, a reputation for professionalism, and you're leading it on the basis of faith. I mean, you all know and people of the Heartland know that for all that we've been through, that the best days for this community, this state, and this nation lie ahead. And I want to thank you so much for your example in these challenging times. And there is great opportunity ahead. I actually learned this morning that GM and LG announced a new battery plant that's going to be built just across the street. And just a week later, Steve announced that you'll be building your own batteries right here in this building. So Lordstown Motors is just the start, and it's going to continue to grow and expand jobs in this area. And with the help , (quiet applause) , help of , you can applaud that. I think that's really big news. (Applause.) Thank you. And with the help of Coach Jim Tressel, I know you're working with Youngstown State to provide on-the-job training for talented engineers and technicians of tomorrow. Can we hear it for Coach Jim Tressel and that great school? (Applause.) Thanks for partnering. (Applause.) Thank you, Coach. And there's a great promise , we only got one truck here on the stage, but Steve actually told me that they've already pre-sold 14,000 additions of the Lordstown Endurance truck that's ready to be made here and shipped out of here. What a great start. (Applause.) So they got a great team here doing the retooling, doing the engineering. But I know, in the months ahead, they're going to be ramping up production. Steve was telling me by about this time next year, they plan to hire five, six, seven, eight hundred people in this community and turn this factory all the way back on. It really is going to be a transition to greatness back here in Lordstown, after a heartbreaking day in 2019. To see this kind of a comeback I , I hope you see it's a testament to the confidence that the people of this company have and the people of this community. It's a tribute to state leadership, to a governor, and to state officials that we're not going to leave Lordstown behind. It's a tribute to a president who was not shy about letting his feelings be known about the future of Lordstown. Am I right? (Applause.) But, ultimately, it is a tribute. It is a tribute to a half a century , half a century of craftsmanship, a half a century of integrity, a reputation that has now drawn the investment to this community , not just this company, but the other companies and investments that have evolved. So, in a very real sense , in a very real sense, to the people of Lordstown: This day at Lordstown Motor is your day. And so I thank you for letting me share it with you, the beginning of a new chapter in the storied history of this great community and this storied facility. And I know that with your hard work in the days ahead, and with the support of your great governor, Mike DeWine, with people like Senator Rob Portman, with the leadership at your statehouse, and with the support of President Donald Trump, and with God's help, the best days for Lordstown and Ohio and America are yet to come. Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Ohio, and God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP28620207	Mike Pence	2020-06-28	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Celebrate Freedom Rally	statement	"It's good to be back in church. (Applause.) Pastor Jeffress, thank you for that overly generous introduction. Thank you for your ministry. To Governor Abbott, Secretary Carson, Senator Cornyn, Attorney General Paxton, my fellow Americans: It is a special joy to be with you today to celebrate freedom on this Sunday in this special place. (Applause.) You know, the Bible tells us it was for freedom that Christ set us free. And I cannot think of a better place to celebrate freedom than here at First Baptist Dallas with all of you and with a man who just spoke, and who has become so precious to your President, to your Vice President, and to all who serve our nation in the White House. Would you join me in just showing your appreciation , (applause) , for Pastor Robert Jeffress for his voice , for his ministry, for his courage, and for his faith. (Applause.) Thank you. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. I heard he tweeted I was going to be here this morning. (Laughter and applause.) He has been a great champion of everything we will celebrate this morning. And he's been a great champion of people of faith and all the freedoms that we cherish. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Just a few days ago, the President said these words. He said, ""We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as Americans."" We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, is the true way of life. And the President concluded by saying, ""We live by the words of our national motto: In God we trust."" (Applause.) And so it can be said of First Baptist Dallas. Since 1890, when a small group of believers laid the cornerstone of this church, this congregation has understood that the foundation of America is freedom, and the foundation of freedom is faith. (Applause.) Which makes it altogether fitting that we gather in this place and that we will gather, in the days ahead, in houses of worship all across America to celebrate freedom. So how do we celebrate freedom? On the occasion of the approval of the Declaration of Independence, our first Vice President said that he was, quote, ""apt to believe that [the day would] be celebrated by succeeding generations as a great anniversary commemorated as a day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God solemnized with pomp and parade, with games and sports and guns and bells and bonfires and illuminations from one end of the continent to the other."" And so it has , (laughter) , especially here in Texas. (Applause.) And even in these challenging times, Americans will find ways, in the days ahead, as we approach our Independence Day, to celebrate just as John Adams described. But those of us who cherish freedom know that we do well to celebrate freedom every day, and to remember, as President Reagan said, that ""Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It's to be fought for, protected, and handed down to them to do the same."" And I'm proud to report to you, as your Vice President, that from the first days of this administration, that's exactly what President Donald Trump has been doing: protecting, defending, and celebrating freedom of every American of every race and creed and color. (Applause.) And to celebrate freedom means many things. To celebrate freedom means building an economy where every American of every walk of life can live the American Dream. And under this President, we've allowed Americans to keep more of what they earn. We've rolled back the heavy hand of federal red tape at a historic pace. We've unleashed the vast natural resources of this land. And with that renewed freedom, before the pandemic struck, American businesses, large and small, had created more than 7 million jobs in our first three years. (Applause.) As we work now to safely reopen this state and this nation to put Americans back to work and to worship, let me take this opportunity to commend Governor Greg Abbott for his courageous and compassionate leadership for the people of Texas during this challenging time. (Applause.) Thank you, Governor Abbott. Working with your governor, we will put the health of the people of the Lone Star State first. And every single day, we'll continue to reclaim our freedom and our way of life , as each day, we are one day closer to the day we put this pandemic in the past. And when we do, with this governor and this President, we'll bring Texas and America back bigger and better than ever before. (Applause.) And as we did this morning, to celebrate freedom also means standing up for and standing with those who defend our freedom at home and abroad. The Armed Forces of the United States are the greatest force for good the world has ever known. (Applause.) And under President Trump's leadership, I'm proud to report to you, after years of budget cutbacks that literally saw a , a significant portion of our Air Force aircraft on the ground being used as spare parts to keep other aircraft in the air, we've rebuilt our military. We've restored the arsenal of democracy. (Applause.) And as the proud father of a United States Marine and the father-in-law of a Navy pilot, I couldn't be more happy to report to you that we're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support they need to accomplish their mission and come home safe. (Applause.) That's how we celebrate freedom as we stand with those who defend our freedom. (Applause.) And to celebrate freedom also means standing with our allies, with freedom-loving people around the world. And under President Donald Trump, if the world knows nothing else, the world knows this: America stands with Israel. (Applause.) To celebrate freedom also means standing up for persecuted people of faith all over the world. And under this President, we've worked tirelessly to stand with persecuted communities, whether it be in the Nineveh Plain of northern Iraq, where we've invested millions to help rebuild Christian and Yazidi communities; or whether it be working, as our President has, to release Americans facing persecution and captivity in places like Egypt and Venezuela. And Pastor Andrew Brunson is home. (Applause.) I'll never forget the day we were on the tarmac when three men who had been held in captivity in North Korea arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. They came down the stairs, and with the Secretary of State at my side, they handed each one of us a three-by-five card that's now framed in my office. On one side was a word of thanks to us and to the President. And on the other side was a Bible verse, as they were praising the Lord for being freed from captivity. They were men of faith and they are free today. (Applause.) And to celebrate freedom also means honoring and respecting the incredible men and women who serve in law enforcement at every level, every day. (Applause.) The American people know most of those who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They walk out the door every morning; they risk their lives to protect us and our families. But we all know the tragic events of recent days. And let me say: There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd, and justice will be served. (Applause.) But there's also no excuse for the rioting, looting, and violence that ensued. (Applause.) Burning churches is not protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech. There will be no tolerance for vandalism or violence in the United States, and we will prosecute those who do it to the fullest extent of the law. (Applause.) That's how we defend freedom. Finally, celebrating freedom means standing up for the values and liberties that we hold dear. As Dr. Jeffress said, that includes appointing now 200 judges to our federal courts who will all uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) And none of it would've been possible without the strong support of the two senators from Texas who have stood with this President every step of the way. We want to thank Senator Ted Cruz. And join me now in thanking Senator John Cornyn for his principled, conservative leadership for our judiciary and our nation. (Applause.) And with the steady counsel of Pastor Robert Jeffress, our President has also defended religious liberty from the first day of this administration. We restored enforcement of the nation's conscience laws. We ended enforcement of the Johnson Amendment so the freedom of speech does not end at the front door of houses of worship in America. (Applause.) And like no other President in American history, President Donald Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) This President and our administration celebrate freedom every day by upholding the ideals on which this nation was founded and defending them in each and every action. And now we find ourselves in a challenging time in our nation's history. We've gone through one of the worst pandemics in the history of this country, an economic downturn none of us expected, and, for a time, we saw chaos engulf the streets of many of our major cities. We've seen statues of some of our nation's greatest heroes being torn down. And one can't help but wonder that ancient question , that if the foundations crumble, how can the righteous stand? And yet, in the midst of such trials, American Christians have hope. We remember the countless triumphs we've won, even in our darkest hours: victories against empires, against injustice, against diabolical tyrannies across the world. During these times, we do well to remember that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. (Applause.) Our first President, George Washington, said, ""Religion and morality are the essential pillars of civil society."" And in his farewell address, he warned: ""In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens "" He added, ""Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in the exclusion of religious principle."" During the tumultuous days of the Revolution, John Adams wrote to a friend that, quote, ""It is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand."" And when he became President, he said,""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other."" It is the faith of the American people that has sustained us through every dark hour of this nation's history. And it is the faith of the American people that will sustain us through these days. (Applause.) It's that faith that has seen us through even greater challenges, guiding us in our relentless drive for a more perfect union, for liberty and justice for all. As Abraham Lincoln said while visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1861, speaking of our founding, he said, quote, there was ""something in that Declaration giving liberty, not only to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time."" He added, ""It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance."" (Applause.) And it happened. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said of the same founding documents that they were a ""promissory note"" of America , the promise that was made that all are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. And in the fires of a civil war, in the midst of civil rights movement, it was the faith of the American people that drove us toward a more perfect union, and the faith of the American people will continue to perfect our nation for generations to come. (Applause.) The foundation of America is freedom. The foundation of freedom is faith. And as President Lincoln reminded us in words that, perhaps providentially, have already been on the wall of this church this morning. In a Thanksgiving message, our 16th President said, ""It is the duty of nations as well as of men to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord."" (Applause.) So in these challenging times, let's , let's hold fast to freedom. But let's also hold fast to that faith. (Applause.) Let's take to heart the title of Pastor Jeffress's latest book, and let's start ""Praying for America"" again. (Applause.) We're told , we're told that ""the prayer the upright pleases Him"" and that prayer reaches heaven, His holy dwelling place. And in these times of great anxiety for many, the Bible tells us, ""Don't be anxious about anything, but in every form of prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God, with the promise that the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."" (Applause.) As our nation faces these difficult days, I believe more than ever that we stand in the need of prayer. In coming here today, I , I thought I , I wanted to encourage you: As you celebrate freedom in this coming week, practice prayer in a renewed way. As we think about the challenges , the loss of more than 125,000 of our countrymen; when we think of the grief of those families; we think of those that are still struggling with this disease today; those who've endured economic hardship in the midst of the challenges we face , let's claim that ancient promise that if His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, He'll do like he's always done through the long and storied history of this nation. He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land. (Applause.) He will. He will. So thank you for letting me join you for this Celebrate Freedom Sunday here at First Baptist Dallas. I would have just come just to sit in the pew , (laughter) , because it has been good for my heart to worship with you all this morning. And let me also say: It's a greatest honor of my life to be your Vice President, and I thank you for myself and for my family. (Applause.) I had a pastor tell me once that everybody is under-encouraged. You have encouraged your Vice President and, I know, all of those in our delegation who are with us today, and we thank you. And I leave here today that , God is at work. And I had occasion to be reminded that, even when it doesn't seem that way, God is still working a little bit earlier this week. You see, I received a letter from a pastor who leads a church not far from Jacksonville, Florida. He told me of a time that he and his new bride were attending Asbury Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky, in 1977. It was a place where they held, in the spring, every year, a Christian music festival. They'd present the gospel with preachers. They'd present what was then the early versions of contemporary Christian music , have young people attend from all over the Midwest. But he wrote to me that, in 1977, they had decided at the seminary to discontinue the event. But he and his new bride felt called to do the work. He wrote to me and said that, ""Several friends told us that it would be very hard on our new marriage, and that we shouldn't do it."" But he said, ""We answered the call. We gathered a few other seminarians to help us,"" and they worked a whole year to arrange the event in the spring in 1978. And then he said, then the night came , the culminating evening on Saturday night, where he and his new bride were walking through the camp area. It was raining, and they were disappointed. They thought it all had been for naught. And then he said, ""And that's because I didn't know that that night a future Vice President of the United States of America would be giving his life to Jesus Christ."" (Applause.) He wrote to me, ""I cannot write this without tears,"" and I could not read it without tears. Because I remember that night: Sitting on a hillside, it was raining, and it was like I , I heard the words for the first time that God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten son, that whoever might believe in Him might not perish but have eternal life. Then I stood up, and I walked down that night , not out of a sense of intellectual assent, but because my heart was broken with gratitude for what had been done for me on the cross. I'm working on a letter to that pastor , (laughter) , which I will not be able to write without tears, and I'm simply going to say, to him and his wife, ""Now I know who else to thank for that night so many years ago."" The lesson in his letter was: Even when things don't seem like they're going the way we expected, they're going away He expected. (Applause.) And we can claim those other ancient words that have been over the fireplace in our home in Indiana, in the Governor's Residence, in the Vice President's Residence today. They read, ""For I know the plans I have for you , plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future."" And I believe with all my heart, on this Celebrate Freedom Sunday and every day, that if we will but hold fast to Him, we'll see our way through these challenging times, we will restore our nation's health, we will renew our freedom, and we will inspire people across this land with our witness of the love and compassion and strength that comes in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Thank you for letting me join you today. God bless you. And God bless America. (Applause.)

VSMP29620206	Mike Pence	2020-06-29	Readout from the Vice President's Governors Briefing on COVID-19 Response & Recovery	statement	"Today, Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of approximately 50 States, territories, and the city of Washington, DC, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss local, State, and Federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. Vice President Pence began the conversation by highlighting his recent visit to Dallas, Texas, where he and Dr. Deborah Birx met with Governor Greg Abbott, State health and emergency officials, and healthcare system executives, and received a ground report on recent cases. During the ground report, Texas officials stressed that existing hospital capacity was higher than reported and emphasized their ability to ""flex"" capacity, if needed. The meeting reinforced the locally-executed, State-managed, and Federally-supported response effort, and how lessons learned from March, April, and May, are being applied now. Vice President Pence informed the governors that he intended to travel to Arizona and Florida this week with the goal of receiving similar updates from those governors. Additionally, Vice President Pence discussed best practices with our Nation's governors on limiting the COVID-19 spread while keeping America open, including encouraging Americans to adhere to state and local guidelines and to wear face coverings when social distancing cannot be maintained. They also discussed efforts to expand testing, support long-term care residents, and maintain necessary healthcare capacity. The Vice President also thanked our Nation's governors for their support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and highlighted the exciting July 1, 2020, implementation milestone for America's farmers, manufacturers, workers, and small businesses. Dr. Birx, who joined the call in New Mexico with Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, discussed testing and trends, including enabling local decision-making for the subset of counties and cities experiencing increasing cases, implementing tailored adjustments to reopening plans based on data, ensuring adequate hospital surge capacity, protecting the most vulnerable especially nursing home residents, deploying increased testing and resources to hot spots, and encouraging citizens follow social distancing guidelines. Dr. Anthony Fauci stressed to governors that public health measures should not be an all or nothing approach, and that those measures should not get in the way of the freedoms Americans enjoy. Secretary Alex Azar urged governors to encourage previous COVID-19 patients to donate convalescent plasma. Secretary Azar also highlighted today's announcement that HHS secured large supplies of the therapeutic, remdesivir, through an agreement with Gilead Sciences, and discussed the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) support for State and local governments. HHS Admiral Brett Giroir provided an update on community-based testing and testing support. Rear Admiral John Polowczyk provided a logistics update on the expansion of domestic production of key resources (including N95s), restocking the National Stockpile and coordinating with States on their warehousing efforts, delivering PPE to nursing homes, building ventilators on-hand in the National Stockpile to over 50,000 by the end of next week. Notably, Admiral Polowczyk updated the group on States' efforts to build their own stockpiles, reporting that 60-70% of States have a 30-60 day supply of PPE. Several governors discussed leading practices to control the spread of COVID-19. Participants from the White House Coronavirus Task Force: The Vice PresidentAmbassador Deborah Birx, M.D., White House Coronavirus Task Force CoordinatorSecretary Alex Azar, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS)Larry Kudlow, Assistant to the President & Director, National Economic Council (NEC)Admiral Brett Giroir, M.D. Assistant Secretary for Health, (HHS)Dr. Tony Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, (HHS)Rear Admiral John Polowczyk, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Department of Defense (DOD)Eric Heighberger, Chief of Staff, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has led over 320 briefings , including 27 governors' briefings , with over 147,000 State, local, and Tribal participants."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1440325/readout-from-the-vice-presidents-governors-briefing-on-covid-19-response-recovery&speechType=6	Health and Health Care			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/readout-vice-presidents-governors-briefing-covid-19-response-recovery-3/
VSMP17720205	Mike Pence	2020-07-17	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the Dangers of Socialism	statement	"Well, hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) Thank you for that warm welcome. To Congressman Glenn Grothman, Congressman Bryan Steil, to state senators, members of the state legislature, honored guests, my fellow Americans: It is good to be here in Ripon, Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party. (Applause.) And it is great to be back in the Badger State with so many great Americans. (Applause.)I thank you all for being here today. But allow me to begin by bringing greetings from another great fan of the Badger State. He's a man who loves the state of Wisconsin, he's been fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of this state every day for the last three and a half years, and he was in this state just not too long ago. So allow me to bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, in our first three years, President Trump did keep every promise that he made to the people of Wisconsin and people all across this country, and the results were extraordinary. I mean, we rebuilt our military. We cut taxes across the board. We rolled back regulations at a record pace, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade. And in our first three years alone, businesses large and small created more than 7 million new jobs all across this country. (Applause.) Wages rose at their fastest pace in more than 10 years, 2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, and 7 million Americans were lifted out of , out of food stamps. And beyond all of that, we reached the highest median income in the history of the United States. (Applause.) It was an extraordinary three years of progress and renewal: rebuilding our military, reviving our economy. And then the coronavirus pandemic struck our nation. But President Trump took unprecedented action. He put the health and safety of America first from the very earliest days. Before the month of January was over, the President suspended all travel from China, stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In fact, since the days that follows, we , we've not only developed a whole-of-government approach, but a whole-of-America approach. We've marshaled the full resources of America to save lives, protect the vulnerable, and to support the extraordinary work of doctors and nurses across this country. And I'll make you a promise: As we continue to respond to this coronavirus pandemic, we're going to work 24 hours a day to ensure that all of our states impacted, all of our hospitals, and all of those great healthcare workers have the supplies and the resources they need to give every American the same level of care that we would want a member of our family to have. (Applause.) We're meeting this moment with American compassion and American resolve. And we're also opening up America again. It's extraordinary to think: At the height of this pandemic, our economy had lost 22 million jobs. But because of that strong foundation that President Trump laid of less taxes, less regulation, in two short months, May and June saw record-breaking job creation. We've already added 7 million jobs back to the American economy, and we're just getting started. (Applause.) But we all know, my fellow Americans, that we are passing through a time of testing for the American people. But soon, we will come to a time for choosing, which is what brings me here today. In 110 days, the American people have a choice to make. And the choice has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. I came here to the city of Ripon, Wisconsin, where the Republican Party was born, to describe that choice. You know, when that first convention met here in 1854, they wrote that their decision to found a new political party had been, and I quote, ""forced upon us by the slave power, and in the defense of freedom"" they said they would ""cooperate and be known as Republicans."" And so they have ever been. (Applause.) Six years later, they elected the first Republican President, who ushered in the abolition of slavery and the advancement of our highest ideals. And four months from now, I know our party will reelect another Republican President, when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years in the White House. (Applause.) But it's why I'm here today: to talk about what's at stake and to talk about the choice our nation faces. Our economic recovery is on the ballot, but also are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country. You know, it's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or Democrat, more red or blue. It's whether America remains America. It's whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the unalienable right to life and liberty , or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that is fundamentally transformed into something else. Like those first Republicans, we stand at a crossroads of freedom. Before us are two paths: one based on the dignity of every individual, and the other on the growing control of the state. Our road leads to greater freedom and opportunity. Their road leads to socialism and decline. President Trump set our nation on a path to freedom and opportunity from the very first day of this administration. (Applause.) But Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline. America is a blessed and exceptional country, unique among the nations. We've been an asylum of hope for millions around the world ""yearning to breathe free,"" as the words on the Statue of Liberty declare. Many of our greatest citizens have come from the corners of the world ruled by socialist regimes. If you ever doubt whether this country is special and unique, just talk to one of them. Before this pandemic, President Trump set our nation on that path of freedom and opportunity for every American regardless of race or creed or color. America's families enjoyed record-low crime rates, record-high prosperity, the safety and security of a government devoted to law-abiding citizens in this country. But now, all of that is under threat. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a ""transition candidate."" But many were asking across this country: A transition to what? And now we have the answer. Recently, Joe Biden combined forces with the socialist Bernie Sanders and the radical-left wing of the Democratic Party. And we don't need to guess where they're planning to take America. Biden and Sanders recently released a document from their Unity Task Force outlining their agenda for the country. And reading that document , you know, I thought Joe Biden won the Democrat primaries, but looking at their unity agenda, it looks to me like Bernie won. When you look at their agenda, the only thing it ended up unifying was Joe Biden to the radical left. Contrary to their radical agenda, President Trump is rebuilding this economy based on freedom and free markets and the rule of law. And the American people know President Donald Trump did it once before and President Donald Trump will do it again. (Applause.) At the root of the Biden-Sanders agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration , that millions of Americans harbor ill-will toward their neighbors, instead of loving our neighbors as themselves. The radical left believes the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children , and, in the process, deprive our people of freedom, prosperity, and security. Their agenda is based on government control; our agenda is based on freedom. (Applause.) I mean, just look at the contrast between our record and the Biden agenda. President Trump cut taxes by $5.5 trillion , the largest tax cut and reform in American history. (Applause.) Joe Biden plans to increase taxes by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade alone, twice as much as Hillary Clinton ever proposed. President Trump not only cut taxes, but we've , we've rolled back federal red tape at a historic pace. This President has actually repealed more federal regulations than any President in American history, enabling our economy to add nearly 8 million jobs in the last 2 months alone. Joe Biden , Joe Biden would impose an avalanche of regulations on our economy, stifling our recovery, and costing American jobs. And when it comes to protecting American jobs, it was President Donald Trump who said ""the era of economic surrender is over,"" and he stood up to China. (Applause.) We fought for free and fair trade. And just the other day, the President also signed an executive order holding China accountable for its treatment of Hong Kong. And we will continue to stand strong. Joe Biden , well, Joe Biden pretends to be tough on China, but the reality is that Joe Biden has helped China all along the way: obtaining most-favored-nation status in the World Trade Organization. And the Obama administration did nothing, when Joe Biden was Vice President, to prevent the outsourcing of millions of jobs and manufacturing to that communist nation. And President Donald Trump has stood for our highest ideals at home and abroad. It was President Donald Trump who withdrew America from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord and saved thousands of American jobs. (Applause.) Joe Biden wants to join the Paris Climate Accord again, placing a crushing weight on the American businesses and the American economy. I mean, under President Trump, the United States has actually achieved energy independence, no longer relying on the Middle East for oil. And now America is a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years. (Applause.) Joe Biden would destroy our fossil fuel industry, return to the war on coal, prevent the development of America's immense energy reserves, and impose a regime of climate change regulations on literally every new building in the United States , every home, every business , that would drastically increase the cost of living for families , and the cost of business, at the cost of jobs. And where President Trump has increased choices and competition in healthcare and achieved a historic decline in the cost of prescription drugs, Joe Biden supports a government takeover of healthcare that would set us on an inexorable path to socialized medicine. And President Trump believes in a strong border for the United States of America. (Applause.) As our President said many times: If you don't have borders, you don't have a nation. And as we stand here today, I'm proud to report, we've already built more than 200 miles of that border wall on the southern border of the United States. (Applause.) And we've stood without apology for the courageous men and women of Customs and Borders Protection and ICE every day. (Applause.) Joe Biden is for open borders. Their agenda calls for an end to deportations; support for sanctuary cities; and free lawyers and free healthcare for illegal immigrants, all paid for by American taxpayers. It's extraordinary. And closer to home, this President has been a champion for allowing every parent to choose where their children goes to school regardless of their income or area code. President Donald Trump stands for school choice. (Applause.) And here in Wisconsin, the birthplace of the school choice movement in America, you deserve to know , (applause) , Joe Biden would take away the right of parents to choose where their children go to school , public, private, or parochial. So you need to tell your neighbors and friends: Joe Biden wants to end school choice. Those are the facts. But it's not just been about our economy and about defending American jobs and health and educational opportunities. I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) By contrast, Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion, repealing the Hyde Amendment, ending a Mexico City policy that prevents federal funding from supporting abortions around the world. And Joe Biden even supports late-term abortion , allowing innocent, unborn children to be aborted right up to the moment of birth. So it's about our economy, it's about our wellbeing, it's about our values, but it's also about the security of our nation at home. And let me say, and don't ever doubt: President Donald Trump and this administration stand with the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) The President and I know the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best of us. They risk their lives every day. They consider our lives more important than their own. And they have our support. We know that it's a false choice to think that we have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African American neighbors and friends. Under President Donald Trump, we will support law enforcement, improve public safety, and stand with African American families and all our minorities to improve the quality of life in our cities and towns. (Applause.) By contrast, Joe Biden believes America is, in his words, systemically racist. And despite historically low crime rates prior to this pandemic, Joe Biden believes that law enforcement in America has a, quote, ""implicit bias"" against minorities. Just recently, when asked whether he'd support defunding the police, Joe Biden capitulated to the radical left-wing mob. He was asked if he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement, and he replied, and I quote, ""Yes, absolutely."" Joe Biden would weaken the Thin Blue Line that separates order from chaos. Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we will never defend , defund the police. We will defend the police every day. This President and this administration will back the blue. (Applause.) The hard truth is: You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. The radical left's experiment in defunding the police is failing families and cities across this country already. Recently, amid defunding efforts around America, cities are struggling with rising crime rates. Atlanta saw a 19 percent rise in shootings, a 9 percent increase in murders. In Chicago, a 42 percent rise in shootings and a 39 percent increase in murders. And in Philadelphia, a 54 percent rise in shootings and nearly 20 percent increase in murders. As a result of Mayor de Blasio's disbanding of the Anti-Crime Unit in New York City , which is a decision many African American leaders are begging him to reverse , that city has already seen an increase of a staggering 277 percent, and the number of victims have skyrocketed by 253 percent. These are shocking numbers, but not surprising. Right here in Wisconsin, the city of Milwaukee has already seen a 50 percent increase in nonfatal shootings and 100 percent increase in murders from the same time last year. It's on pace to break the record of homicide rate that was set 30 years ago. This is a frightening preview of Joe Biden's agenda in action. After years of plummeting crime rates under President Donald Trump, Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities. When you hear Joe Biden call for defunding the police, remember what's at stake: law and order, safety, and the peace of mind that you, your family, and your children have every right to enjoy as citizens of this country. When you consider Joe Biden's agenda and his embrace of the radical left, it's clear: Joe Biden would be nothing more than an autopen president, a Trojan horse for a radical agenda , so radical, so all-encompassing that it would transform this country into something utterly unrecognizable. It's no wonder that socialist Bernie Sanders said that if Joe Biden was elected, he would, in his words, ""transform the country"" and be, and I quote, ""the most progressive President"" in nearly a century. The Biden-Sanders agenda would set America on the path of socialism and decline. And as our nation endures this time of testing, we'd do well to tell our neighbors and friends that it's also the time for choosing. We need to tell our fellow Americans that we can choose to stay on a path that starts from the belief in the goodness of the American people, that starts from the premise that America is exceptional, is founded on freedom, and always striving for a more perfect union. Just last week, President Trump spoke at a roundtable with a Cuban immigrant by the name of Maximo Alvarez. Maximo escaped communist Cuba when he was 13. He was one of the last kids to flee with a group of nuns whose convent had been taken over by the communist dictator that Bernie Sanders praised in the past. Maximo had a stark warning for our country at that forum. He said, and I quote, ""What's happening in our backyard today, I experienced as an 11-year-old."" Maximo went on to say, ""I remember vividly all the promises that Castro gave. I remember the promises that we hear today about free education, free healthcare, free land."" And then he recalled what his father told him about the glory of being an American. Maximo said that his father told him, ""Don't lose that place, because if you lose that place, you'll have no place to go."" America is a beacon of hope and freedom for all the world. (Applause.) Maximo's admonition reminds us of the words of another Republican President who famously reminded us that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" We didn't pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same or, President Reagan added, ""one day, we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like to live in the United States when men were free."" We have to fight for our freedom again. President Ronald Reagan was right in his time. And I promise you: That fighter in the White House will never stop fighting for freedom. President Donald Trump will continue to fight for the freedom of every American, and so we must fight with him. (Applause.) My fellow Americans, that's the choice we face. We have two paths before us: one of freedom and opportunity, the other of socialism and decline. We can either be true to ourselves and what's made this nation a beacon of hope for all the world, or we can become like the very places that many of our ancestors fled and that many still flee to come here. In pondering the decision that lies before us, I can't help but think of the words of the great American poet Robert Frost , my wife's favorite poet. He wrote, and I quote, ""Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."" The truth is, through the long and storied history of this country, Americans have always chosen the road less traveled by: the road of freedom, individual responsibility. And I know we will do so again. I know this because, like our President, and those who founded the Republican Party so many years ago here in Ripon, I believe in freedom, and I know this is a freedom-loving nation. (Applause.) I know the love of freedom beats in the heart of every American. And I know we will choose well, again, in this November, because I have faith , faith that every time the American people have given the choice between more freedom and less freedom, they stand for freedom, they fight for freedom, and they choose freedom every single time. (Applause.) This is a freedom-loving nation, and it's also a nation of faith. And it's on that hope I stand as well. The Bible says, ""Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" And so millions of Americans believe, as I do, that when we stand up for the God-given freedoms of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the freedoms won and defended throughout our nation's history, we make his work on this Earth our own, and that means freedom always wins. (Applause.) So that's the choice we face, my fellow Americans: between freedom and opportunity or socialism and decline. And I have no doubt, as all of us do all that we can, even in these challenging times between now and November 3rd, we'll see our way through. We'll be there for our neighbors and friends, we will heal our land, and then we will win a great victory for freedom and our very way of life. And with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, we'll make America great again, again. Thank you all very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Wisconsin. And God bless America. END 12:24 P.M.

VSMP18720204	Mike Pence	2020-07-18	Vice President Pence Statement on the Passing of Congressman John Lewis	statement	Congressman John Lewis was a great man whose courage and decades of public service changed America forever, and he will be deeply missed. John Lewis will be remembered as a giant of the civil rights movement whose selflessness and conviction rendered our nation into a more perfect union and his example will inspire generations of Americans. While John Lewis will be rightly remembered as an icon of the civil rights movement, for me he was also a colleague and a friend. Even when we differed, John was always unfailingly kind and my family and I will never forget the privilege of crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge at his side on the 45th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Karen and I and send our prayers and deepest sympathies to his family and friends and all who mourn the passing of this good and great man. May God bless the memory of John Lewis and may his example ever inspire.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1449972/vice-president-pence-statement-on-the-passing-of-congressman-john-lewis&speechType=6	Arts, Entertainment, and History			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-statement-passing-congressman-john-lewis/
VSMP30720203	Mike Pence	2020-07-30	Remarks by Vice President Pence on the Trump Administration's Pro-Growth Economic Policies	statement	"Well, hello, Pennsylvania! (Applause.) Thank you so much to Karen Kelley for all the great work she does; to Guy Berkebile and the great people of Guy Chemical. It is great to be here in Somerset County, where people of the Commonwealth are driving a great American comeback. Thank you so much. (Applause.) I'm really honored to be with you all and I appreciate , I appreciate that warm welcome. It's great to be among so many friends. And while we're getting started, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine. I called him from Air Force Two, told him I was headed to Pennsylvania to be with all you good people, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. (Laughter.) So allow me to bring greetings from a man who loves the Keystone State and has been fighting to keep the promises that he made to the people of Pennsylvania for the last three and a half years. I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it really is great to be back in Somerset County, and, please, you can take a seat. It's great to be back in Somerset County. It's a place of great families; great businesses, just like this one; great family farms; and I know and I say from my heart, having been in Washington, D.C. on that fateful day, now nearly 20 years ago, this is a place where America will forever remember the heroes forged in the skies on Flight 93, and I thank you for this community's devotion to that vital memorial. (Applause.) You know, on a personal level, let me also say Somerset County is pretty special to the Pence family. I was telling some of the team here at Guy Chemical earlier, all my kids , one of whom is a Marine, married; another one who's married to a Navy pilot; another one, who just finished her schooling , all of them spent every summer for 10 years at Summer's Best Two Weeks. And we just love Somerset County and the role that it played on their faith and their upbringing. (Applause.) So thank you all for that. I know so many churches in the region play a critical role in that , that wonderful place, and I hope you'll give them all regards. And it really is great to be here at Guy Chemical. We just got a tour from your CEO. And I'll tell you what: It is entrepreneurs like Guy and companies like Guy Chemical that represent the very best of America. This is a place that believes in hard work, in sacrifice, in loving your neighbor, and you can find it all right here in Somerset County at this great company. (Applause.) Now, it's amazing to think of all we accomplished over the last three and a half years. After fr- , after three years of leadership under President Donald Trump, this economy was booming. And President Trump, as I said, literally kept every promise that he made to the people of Pennsylvania and then some and the results were extraordinary. We cut taxes across the board for working families, businesses, and family farms. This President rolled back more federal regulations already than any President in American history. (Applause.) We fought for free and fair trade. We just signed the new USMCA deal into law, and we fought for American energy. And we're a net exporter of American energy now for the first time in 70 years. (Applause.) And none of that would have been possible without the strong support in our first two years of Republican majorities in the House of Representatives. And I would be remiss today if I didn't take a moment not just to acknowledge, but to thank a strong, conservative leader in the Congress of the United States who was there every step of the way as we brought this economy all the way back in our first three years. Join me in thanking Congressman John Joyce for all the great work that he does for this state and this nation. (Applause.) Thank you, John. What a great guy. With Congressman Joyce's support and President Trump's leadership, the results were amazing. In our first three years alone, businesses large and small created more than 8 million jobs. Wages were rising at their fastest pace in nearly 10 years, and they were rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue- collar Americans. In the first three years of this administration, the forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more. That's what we call promises made and promises kept. (Applause.) Two million Americans were lifted out of poverty. Seven million Americans were lifted off food stamps. And we reached the highest median income in the history of this country. And as I mentioned, America made enormous strides toward energy independence. We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. (Applause.) And I'll make you a promise: This President is going to continue to support policies that allow us to develop all of the resources in this land, and that includes , we're going to support fracking in Pennsylvania and the thousands of jobs that it supports. (Applause.) Now, the people of Pennsylvania deserve to know that if the other side gets their way, the future is going to look very different. It's true. I mean, with Joe Biden and the Democratic Party , instead of cutting taxes, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They want to bury our economy under an avalanche of regulation. And Joe Biden and the Democrats have a $2 trillion plan to abolish fossil fuels, including natural gas. They want to end fracking , destroy those jobs all across this state and all across this nation. You know, whereas Joe Biden and the Democrats propose policies that'll stifle jobs and wages and energy, President Donald Trump and I are going to fight for a growing America. Less government, less taxes, less regulation, and more American energy. (Applause.) You know, it really is amazing , it really is amazing when you think about those first three years. Pennsylvania employed a record number of workers, set a record in history, and gained back nearly 20,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember the last administration? The summer of 2016, the last President said, when he was asked about bringing back manufacturing jobs and they'd lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the last administration , he said , he said, ""What are you going to , what are you going to have, a magic wand? How are you going to bring those jobs back?"" Well, we didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House; 500,000 manufacturing jobs came roaring back in those first three years. (Applause.) Median income rose in this state by $1,400 dollars and we established more than 300 Opportunity Zones in Pennsylvania alone in 289 low-income communities. We're fighting for the opportunities for every American. It's extraordinary. Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians were lifted out of poverty. In all these areas , jobs, wages, Opportunity Zones, median income , America and Pennsylvania were outperforming the last eight years. I mean, the truth is, President Donald Trump achieved more in the last three and a half years then some politicians achieved in the last 30. (Applause.) And then 2020 came, and the coronavirus pandemic struck our nation. And I'm proud to report that even before the first instance of community transmission of the coronavirus in this country, President Trump took unprecedented action to put the health and safety of America first. And the truth is, our nation is going through a time of testing. And let me say from my heart that our prayers and our sympathies are with all of the more than 150,000 families that have lost loved ones in the midst of this pandemic. As we continue to contend with the coronavirus in various places across our country, President Trump and our team, and the task force will continue to marshal the full resources of the federal government and the full power of the American economy to meet this moment and put the health of America first. I promise you. (Applause.) I mean, even before the month of January was out, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China , the second-largest economy in the world. He asked me to lead the Coronavirus Task Force that he also set up before the first month of the year was over. We've reinvented testing from a standing start. As of today, we've done 55 million coronavirus tests , many, many times more than any country in the world. We've manufactured and directed hundreds of millions of medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and we're continuing to do that in hotspots across America today. And working with our great medical companies, I'm proud to report we're distributing medicines and we are well on our way to developing a vaccine for the American people by the end of this year. (Applause.) It's amazing. Only in America could you have seen the whole-of-the-nation response that's been led by President Donald Trump. With the cooperation of all of you and people across this country, we're going to make our way through this challenging time. The truth is, we're actually beginning to see encouraging trends , even across the Sun Belt, where coronavirus cases have risen dramatically over the last three weeks. So we all should remain vigilant. We all should do our part: practice good hygiene, wear a mask whenever it's indicated, protect the vulnerable. And I promise you, we're going to work every day to make sure that every American impacted in this pandemic has the same level of healthcare any one of us would want for a member of our family. We're going to work around the clock to hasten the day that we have a vaccine, and we will put this coronavirus in the past once and for all. (Applause.) But from the onset of this pandemic, President Trump didn't just marshal a response to the health challenges our nation faced, but the President also made it clear that we were going to do whatever it took to get American families and American businesses through these challenging times. We worked with the Congress, leaders in both political parties, to secure resources to make direct payments to every American. We launched what's called the Paycheck Protection Program that allowed businesses just like this one to be able to keep people on the payroll during those early difficult days where businesses were required to shut down. And thanks to the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and this President's leadership, the American people, and great companies like Guy Chemical, every day we are one day closer to putting the coronavirus in the past, and we're already opening up America again. (Applause.) It's amazing to think, at the lowest point in this pandemic, our economy lost 22 million jobs. But thanks to that solid foundation that President Trump laid in our first three years, we've already gained back 8 million jobs just in May and June alone, including 440,000 jobs right here in Pennsylvania. (Applause.) The great American comeback is underway. It's because of that foundation that was poured, but mostly it's because of hardworking people like all of you who have labored through this challenging time, looked after your neighbors and loved ones and friends, and gone right back to work. You know, President Lincoln once said, ""I'm always for the man who wishes to work."" And I promise you, President Donald Trump feels the same way. We are for working Americans and going back to work. (Applause.) This President and I know and believe that hard work is at the very heart of the American Dream, and the American people , the American people love to work hard. That's why we're always going to choose the path of greater freedom and greater opportunity. We're going to continue to advance policies that will make it possible for more businesses around America to do just what Guy Chemical has done, and that is: show resilience and generosity, and open the doors of businesses, and put America back to work. Which brings me to Guy and Guy Chemical. You know, Guy, I not only want to thank you for your hospitality today, but I want to thank you for your leadership. You exemplify what is making this great American comeback happen all over the nation. And we thank you for your leadership, and for your family, and for your devotion to all the great people of this company and this community. (Applause.) I learned all about Guy on my way here. His story shows us at the end of the day, this is a , this is a company that's not just about facts and figures; this is a company, first and foremost, that's about people, families, and the dignity and the importance that comes from hard work. You know, I'm told that, in Guy's first few years, the company lost money and Guy didn't earn a salary for five years.Guy always made sure he paid his employees before he paid himself. He mortgaged his house seven times. And he and his wonderful wife and their family made huge sacrifices during those years. When they were young, Guy's kids, I'm told, would bring their sleeping bags and video game to stay overnight at the plant because somebody had to watch them, and Mom had to work. You hinged your family's future to the success of this company every single day, and it all paid off. Your faith, your determination, your vision, your hard work, and your love for this community and these people , Guy Chemical became, Inc. , an Inc. 500 company. And in 2013, Guy chemical was the SBA Exporter of the Year. (Applause.) Wow. At the beginning in January 2017, you began growing at a rate unequaled in those previous 25 years. He told me, standing in the back , we talked a little bit about faith, family, and then he said to me that, thanks to President Trump's tax cut, Guy Chemical has been able to grow and expand every day since. (Applause.) You bought new equipment; I got to see some of it. And I don't know how it works, but it was very impressive. You bought that new equipment, sales grew by 9 million, and you were able to hire another 29 new people in this community. Washington taxed you less, and you increased the salaries and bonuses for the workers at Guy Chemical. In 2019 alone, you all deserve to know that Guy and Guy chemical raised wages for plant employees by 10 to 15 percent. And since President Trump took office and we got those tax cuts done, this company has grown by 33 percent. That's how America grows. (Applause.) But like every other business in America, when the pandemic hit, Guy Chemical took a hit. But that didn't stop Guy or this great family or this great team. It's really impressive to me that you didn't close. You extended a hand of support to your employees. And thanks to your quick action, you were able to become part of the solution. I'm told that in just one short week, you received FDA approval and Guy Chemicals started producing hand sanitizers and providing them all over the state and all over America. That's what it means to be part of the solution. (Applause.) And you donated thousands of hand sanitizers to businesses and organizations and churches all across the region. You're part of a great American comeback, and it's a comeback that starts right here with heart. It's the heart for your faith in God, which everybody who knows you knows is real. It's your foundation. But it's so heart for your family, it's a heart for all these great people that's driving a great American comeback at this great company , and frankly, all over Pennsylvania and all over America. Hard work, sacrifice, loving your neighbor as yourself , it's what brings Pennsylvania back, and it's going to bring America all the way back. (Applause.) In fact, this company is already making plans. Guy , Guy told me when I got here that, thanks to those tax cuts , the ability to expense , expense the investment in equipment and all the other tax cuts that were put into effect over the last three and a half years , Guy Chemical is announcing today that they're making a $3.5 million investment right here in Somerset County. They're going to hire another 30 people and get this economy rolling again. (Applause.) Thanks for leading the great American comeback. You know, some people believe more government, more red tape, and pushing some Washington agenda is what makes America great. But I want to assure you, President Trump and I , we know that it's people like all of you, people at places like this, families, and businesses, and family farms all across Somerset County, you're what make America great. And you're going to make America great again. (Applause.) You're the ones who create the jobs. You're the ones who provide for your families the dignity of hard work. You're the ones who extend your hands in love to neighbors and friends in challenging times. You're the heart of the great American comeback, and I just came here to say thank you , thank you for all you've done. You know, I've long believed that faith and freedom in our vast natural resources are the pillars of American greatness. And here in Pennsylvania, you've built this Commonwealth through the generations on those same ideals and values: a belief in freedom and the development of the resources of this land, the goodness of your people, and on the grace of God. Here in a state that was founded on religious liberty, whose founder, William Penn, once famously said, ""I shall not usurp the right of any for God has furnished me with a better resolution and [it] has given me [the] grace to keep it."" You have kept the faith in Pennsylvania, and so shall we. (Applause.) And with confidence that He who was with William Penn when he founded the Commonwealth so long ago is still with us today, I say with confidence that with President Donald Trump in the White House, with faith and hard work of the great people of Somerset and of the Keystone State, I know the best days for Pennsylvania and America are yet to come. In our first three years, we made America great again. And with your support and prayers and hard work, we're going to make America great again, again. Thank you very much. (Applause.) God bless you. God bless Pennsylvania and God bless America. END 3:21 P.M.

VSMP268202032	Mike Pence	2020-08-26	Transcript: Mike Pence's RNC speech	speech	"Read Vice President Mike Pence's speech from the 2020 Republican National Convention, as prepared for delivery: Good evening, America.It is an honor to speak to you tonight from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry. The site of the very battle that inspired the words of our national anthem.Those words have inspired this Land of Heroes ever since.It was on this site 206 years ago when our young Republic heroically withstood a ferocious naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on earth.They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation, and to end the American experiment.The heroes who held this fort took their stand for Life, liberty, freedom and the American flag. Those ideals have defined our nation.Yet they were hardly ever mentioned during last week's Democratic Convention.Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America. Joe Biden said we were living through a ""season of American darkness.""But as President Trump said, ""where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness.""In these challenging times... our country needs a president who believes in America. Who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we all hold dear...America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House!Before I begin, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of hurricane Laura.Our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted and FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm's way. This is a serious storm. We urge all those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities.Stay safe, and know that we'll be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, response, and recovery in the days and weeks ahead.Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had leadership and the vision to make America great again.For the last four years, I have watched this President endure unrelenting attacks and get up every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people.So, with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States.Serving the American people in this office has been a journey I never expected. A journey that would not be possible without the support of my family, beginning with my wonderful wife Karen, a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children and an outstanding Second lady of the United States. And WE couldn't be more proud of our three children: Marine Corp Captain Michael J. Pence, his wife Sarah, our daughter Charlotte Pence Bond, author and wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond, who is currently deployed and serving our nation in the United States Navy and our recent law school graduate daughter Audrey and her fiancée, who like so many other Americans, had to delay their wedding this summer, but we can't wait for Dan to be a part of our family. In addition to my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight, my mom Nancy. She's the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, mom follows politics closely. And truth be told, sometimes I think I'm actually her second-favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. To mom and to my father looking down, thank you, I love you.Over the past four years, I've worked closely with our President. I've seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways but there's no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is... a nation that has done more good in this world than any other . . . a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance . . . and if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, then he's not your man.We came by very different routes to this partnership and some people think we're a little bit different. But I've learned a few things watching him deal with all we've been through these past four years. He does things his own way, on his own terms. Not much gets past him and when he has an opinion, he's liable to share it. He's certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, he's kept his word.In a city known for talkers...President Donald Trump is a doer. Few presidents have brought more independence, energy, and determination to that office.Four years ago we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the great depression... ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values like freedom of religion, and the right to life.That's when President Trump stepped in.From Day one, he kept his word. He rebuilt our military, created the Space Force, the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years... and we returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly a decade.And after years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care they earned, President Trump kept his word. We reformed the VA ... and veterans choice is now available to every veteran.Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes and this historic fort. Tonight we have among us.. four recipients of the Medal of Honor... 6 recipients of the Purple Heart and a Gold Star mother, of a gallant Navy SEAL ... wounded warriors from Soldier Strong, a group that serves injured veterans ... We're honored by your presence. Thank you for your service.With heroes just like these we defend this nation every day and we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil.Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty. Earlier this year, I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world's most dangerous terrorist.Iran's top general will never harm another American again because Qassem Soleimani is gone.My fellow Americans you deserve to know, Joe Biden criticized President Trump following his decision to rid the world of both of those terrorists. But it's not surprising because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden.It's no wonder Bob Gates, Secretary of defense under the Obama Biden Administration said Joe Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.""So, we've stood up to our enemies and we've stood with our allies.Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.And closer to home, appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts, supported the right to life and all our God given liberties including the second amendment right to keep and bear arms.But when it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some...to pass the largest tax cut and reform in American history, rolled back more federal red tape than any admin, unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade.in our first three years, Businesses large and small created more than 7 million jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs. America became a net exporter of energy for first time in 70 years.Under President Trump, unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, hit their lowest levels ever!On this 100th anniversary of women's right to vote, I'm proud to report that under President Donald Trump we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans were working than ever before.In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again.And then the coronavirus struck from China.Before the first case of coronavirus spread within the United States, President Trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from China.That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II. President Trump marshalled the full resources of the federal government and directed us to forge seamless partnerships with governors across America in both parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies and we're now conducting 800,000 tests per day... have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of Personal Protective Equipment... And we saw to the manufacture of 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. And no who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We built hospitals, we surged military medical personnel and enacted an economic rescue package that saved 50 million American jobs.As we speak we're developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across the country. Last week, Joe Biden said ""no miracle is coming."" What Joe doesn't seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles and we're on track to have the world's first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.After all the sacrifice in this... year like no other , all the hardship, we are finding our way forward again.But tonight, our hearts are with all the families who have lost loved ones. We mourn with those who mourn, and we grieve with those who grieve. And this night I know millions of Americans will pause and pray for God's comfort to each of youA country doesn't get through such a time unless its people find the strength within. The response by doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who are putting the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic.Veronica Say-ez put on her scrubs and went into work day in and day out in one of New York's busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job until it was done. Her brother William is a New York City firefighter. and they're emblematic of heroes all across this country. You've earned the admiration of your fellow Americans, and the thanks of a grateful nation.Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again.Because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years, we've already gained back 9.3 million jobs over the last three months. And we're not just opening up America again, we're re-opening America's schools. I'm proud to report that my wife Karen, a lifelong school teacher, will be returning to her classroom next week.To all the heroic teachers, faculty, and staff...You have our thanks.In the days ahead, as we open up America again and open up America's schools, I promise you we'll continue to put the health of America first.And as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play and we all have a choice to make.On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world.The choice is clear to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.My fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. For in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation has begun to recover, we've seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities.President Donald Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest, tearing down statues is not free speech. Those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.Last week, Joe Biden didn't say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country.Let me be clear: the violence must stop , whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha.Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans strike each other down.We will have law and order on the streets of America.President Trump and I know the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. They put their lives on the line every day.People like Dave Patrick Underwood was an officer of the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California. We are joined tonight by his sister Angela. Angela, we grieve for your family and are grateful for his service. And America will never forget Dave Patrick Underwood and his service and sacrifice to this nation.The American people know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, and standing with African American neighbors to improve the quality of life in our cities and towns.From the first days of this administration, we have done both.And we will keep doing both for four more years in the White House.Joe Biden says America is systemically racist. And that law enforcement in America has a, quote, ""implicit bias"" against minorities.And when asked whether he'd support cutting funding to law enforcement, and he replied, ""Yes, absolutely.""Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to unsafe streets and violence in America's cities.The hard truth is... you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we're not going to defund the police , not now, not ever.My fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. Soon, we will come to a time for choosing.Joe Biden has referred to himself as a ""transition candidate."" But many are asking: A transition to what? Last week, Democrats didn't talk much about their agenda, and if I were them, I wouldn't want to either.Bernie Sanders, did tell his followers that Joe Biden could be the most liberal President of modern times, and confirmed that, quote, ""Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream"" in the Democratic Party.At the root of their agenda, is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration , that millions of Americans harbor ill-will toward their neighbors, instead of loving our neighbors as themselves. The radical left believes the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children , and, in the process, deprive our people of freedom, prosperity, and security. Their agenda is based on government control; our agenda is based on freedom.Where President Trump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion.Where this President achieved energy independence for the United States. Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, end fracking, and impose a regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families.Where we fought for free and fair trade this President stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender.Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China , wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers and actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the outset of this pandemic.Joe Biden is for open borders; sanctuary cities; and free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants. President Trump has secured our southern border and built nearly 300 miles of the wall.Joe Biden wants to end school choice. President Trump believes every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code.Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth. President Donald Trump has been the most pro-life President in American history.When you consider their agenda it's clear: Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for a radical left.The choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher.Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot but the truth is... our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order is on the ballot. But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country.It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election Is whether America remains America.It's whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets, and the unalienable right to life and liberty , or whether we will leave to our children and grandchildren a country that is fundamentally transformed into something else.We stand at a crossroads, America.President Trump set our nation on a path to freedom and opportunity from the very first day of this administration. But Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline.President Donald Trump believes in America and the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams in freedom. Every day, President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day, our President has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. And on everyday, President Donald Trump has been fighting for you. Now it's our turn to fight for him.On this night, in the company of heroes, I am deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as Vice President of this great nation. I pray to be worthy of it. And I will give that duty all that is in me.In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully we have a President with the toughness, energy and resolve to see us through. Those traits run in our national character... as that invading force learned on approach to this fort on September 1814. Against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit. But they never did. Fort McHenry held. And when morning came our flag was still here.My fellow Americans, we are going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see... our flag is still there.That Star - Spangled Banner still waves ove'r the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it's our turn.So let's run the race marked out for us. Let's fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents, fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire ...let's fix our eyes on the author and perfector of our faith and freedom...and never forget that ""where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,"" That means freedom always wins....My fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve as your Vice President again. I leave here today inspired. And I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do as Americans have done through our long and storied past, we will defend our freedom and way of life in November of 2020, we will re-elect our president and principled Republican leaders across this land...and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and Gods help...we will make America great again, again.May God Bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1462567/transcript-mike-pences-rnc-speech&speechType=1	National Security Civil Liberties and Civil Rights Executive Branch Foreign Affairs Health and Health Care Arts, Entertainment, and History			https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/26/politics/mike-pence-speech-transcript/index.html
VSMP39202031	Mike Pence	2020-09-03	Vice President Mike Pence Accepts Endorsement from Southern States Police Benevolent Association, Condemns Joe Bid ...	speech	"As rioters and looters wreak havoc in communities across America, Joe Biden refuses to condemn the violent leftist organizations that promote the chaos. While Democrat mayors allow their cities to burn, President Trump has stepped up to support police officers and enforce law and order as Joe Biden accuses the law enforcement community of 'systemic racism.' As Vice President Pence explained while accepting the endorsement of the Southern States Police Benevolent Association in Raleigh, North Carolina, only the Trump Administration has consistently stood up to violent agitators and backed the blue: ""Joe Biden, we know, got out of his basement this week. He went to Pennsylvania. After months of staying silent about rioting and looting and violence in the streets of our cities, Joe Biden said we have to stand against violence in every form it takes. But right after he said that, he criticized law enforcement. He never mentioned the anarchists and the left-wing mobs that have been sowing violence in the streets of our major cities. He never condemned Antifa. He never called out his campaign staff or his running mate that actually were raising money to bail out violent criminals. And Joe Biden never called out Democrat mayors or Democrat governors who have failed to quell the violence in their cities and their state. The truth is that Joe Biden would double down on the policies that have led to violence in American cities. And the hard truth is, you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."" While in Raleigh, Vice President Pence also attended a fireside chat hosted by the Susan B. Anthony List. President Trump is the most pro-life president in American history, and his administration will always fight to defend the unborn and preserve the sanctity of life."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1463875/vice-president-mike-pence-accepts-endorsement-from-southern-states-police-benevolent-association-condemns-joe-bidens-failure-to-support-law-and-order&speechType=1	Government Operations			https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/vice-president-mike-pence-accepts-endorsement-from-southern-states-police-benevolent-association-condemns-joe-bidens-failure-to-support-law-and-order/
VSMP79202030	Mike Pence	2020-09-07	Vice President Mike Pence Delivers Labor Day Remarks at A Stronger American Workforce in Wisconsin	speech	"For forty-seven years, Joe Biden has undermined American workers and businesses by sponsoring globalist trade deals, increasing burdensome regulations, and attacking the energy industry. Even as President Trump has rebuilt our economy through his America First trade deals, tax cuts, and deregulatory actions, Joe Biden is partnering with his party's socialist wing to propose radical job-killing policies. Vice President Mike Pence contrasted the threat of a Biden presidency with the successes of the Trump Administration while delivering Labor Day remarks at A Stronger American Workforce in La Crosse, Wisconsin: ""It's amazing to think that in the middle of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. President Trump for our part not only cut taxes for working families and businesses large and small, but as we speak, we're letting the American people keep more of what they earn, and I promise you we're going to keep fighting for tax relief for working Americans every day. Where President Trump signed more laws cutting federal red tape than any president in American history, Joe Biden wants to bury the American economy under an avalanche of red tape, like his own version of the Green New Deal. And here at Dairyland Power, you deserve to know that Joe Biden and the radical left want to crush American energy and American energy jobs."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1463866/vice-president-mike-pence-delivers-labor-day-remarks-at-a-stronger-american-workforce-in-wisconsin&speechType=1	Taxes Elections			https://www.donaldjtrump.com/media/vice-president-mike-pence-delivers-labor-day-remarks-at-a-stronger-american-workforce-in-wisconsin/
VSMP109202029	Mike Pence	2020-09-10	Remarks by Vice President Pence in Address to the VMI Corps of Cadets	speech	"Thank you all. Well, to your Superintendent, General Peay; the president of the VMI Board of Visitors, Bill Boland; members of the board; Mayor Frank Friedman; active-duty men and women; and all those who've worn the uniform of the United States; VMI cadets; and even you ""rats"": It is great to be here to honor the Virginia Military Institute. Thank you for that warm welcome. (Applause.) And it's also , as General Peay just said, it's also a particular honor to be here with two distinguished VMI graduates from the class of 1996. The first: the former Army Special Operations, Captain of the 75th Ranger Regiment, deployed to Afghanistan during the invasion after 9/11 attacks, and now he's Secretary of the Army. Would you join me in welcoming VMI's own Ryan McCarthy? Ryan, would you stand up? (Applause.) And another member of the class of 1996: He was a Green Beret who served multiple tours in Afghanistan and Africa, a four-time bronze star recipient, who is actually still serving as a colonel in the National Guard. But he's also serving as a member of the United States House of Representatives from the great state of Florida. Would you join me in giving a warm VMI welcome back to Congressman Mike Waltz? (Applause.) It's an honor to be here with all of you, with all the distinguished Americans who are with us today, and to be among so many friends. And speaking of friends of mine, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine, who I told this morning that I was headed to VMI and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of all the men and women of our Armed Forces and our veterans; I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) You know, it's an honor to be here at VMI , our nation's first state-supported military college. It's really amazing to think about the tradition of which you are a part. For 181 years, this institution has been training up citizen-soldiers who are educated, confident, capable leaders; who have a love of learning and a high sense of public service. Every one of you participates in the ROTC all four years you're here. And I , I'm told more than half your 2020 class were commissioned in the Armed Forces of the United States and that members of the VMI student body are currently pursuing commissions in every single branch of our armed forces. So on behalf of your future Commander-in-Chief and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you for stepping forward to learn at VMI. And to all of you who are leaning in to wearing the uniform of the United States, thank you for stepping forward for America. (Applause.) You know, in 1785, Abigail Adams exhorted her son and future President, John Quincy Adams, with the following words. She said, and I quote, ""Your country will one day call for your services, either in the Cabinet or field. Qualify yourself to do honor to her."" Those words of admonition are exactly what each one of you are doing here at VMI. For whether in the Cabinet or in the field, as civilians or commissioned officers, here at VMI, you are qualifying yourselves to do honor to your families and your country. In fact, I think it's safe to say that no better word captures the spirit of this storied place through its 181 years than the word ""honor."" So says your legendary code, a code you live by every day. At VMI, honor is at the core of what you do. And thanks to the extraordinary education and training you are learning here today, honor will be the central characteristic of who you become. (Applause.) A brief look at your storied alumni proves that. These hallowed halls have produced no less than 290 flag officers , legendary leaders like civil rights martyr Jonathan M. Daniels; Marshall Plan architect and Nobel Prize winner, General George C. Marshall; and seven Medal of Honor recipients. You have quite a heritage to live up to, but I know each and every one of you intend , intend to live by honor and live a life of honor, just like those that have gone before. And really, it's ultimately why I'm here today, on behalf of your President and a grateful nation. I came here just to pay honor to the great heritage of the Virginia Military Institute and to all the men and women who have passed through these hallways to either serve in the uniform of the United States or serve their nation by other means. And all the days to do so, it's humbling for me to stand before you today, in this historic place, the day before September 11th. Nineteen years ago tomorrow, America changed forever. It's remarkable to reflect that an entire generation of Americans, including many of you, have now been born, raised, and entered adulthood, who never experienced that day. But for those of us who lived through that day, it will never be just another day on the calendar. It will always be a day we never forget. Tomorrow, the hearts and prayers of the American people will once again be focused on the nearly 3,000 families who lost loved ones on that day of fire and sorrow. For many, that day shattered our sense of safety and security in the homeland. As a new member of Congress, I'll never forget where I was, just off Capitol Hill, when I heard that the towers were struck in New York City. I'll never forget walking out of that office building across from the U.S. Capitol and literally seeing what had that morning been a clear blue sky over our nation's capital, literally filled with billows of smoke , dark brown and black smoke rising out of the Pentagon. Our nation suffered great loss that day. VMI lost two of its own on that day. One was a civilian, Charles Mathers, Class of 1961. His office was inside the World Trade Center, and he was lost when the towers collapsed. The other was a sailor, Lieutenant Commander David Williams, who was at his desk in the Pentagon that morning. As a cadet in 1991, I'm told that David wrote an article remembering the lives of two alumni who had perished in Operation Desert Storm. He wrote that VMI would never forget their names, that they would be carved on a wall here for all time. Exactly 10 years later, David Williams would have his own name added to that wall in this storied place. Another VMI alumni, Jim Spellman, Class of 1985, actually was there , with everything he learned here at VMI , to help the City of New York, the people of New York, and our nation recover in the aftermath of that terrible attack. I'm told he was in his office across the street from the World Trade Center when the planes hit the towers. And after they came down, his VMI training kicked in. He didn't run away from the chaos; he ran toward it. For more than a week, he helped first responders sift through the rubble in the hope of recovering survivors. As a new member of Congress, I'll never forget traveling with a large delegation of elected officials. We made our way in just a week and a few days after 9/11 , we made our way there to Ground Zero to see an enormous mountain of debris. And literally every building around, covered with ash, turned into some nightmarish black-and-white photograph. But it was there that he labored. We're told that exhaustion overtook him on a particularly hard shift because they were working around the clock to find anyone that may have survived, anyone that might have been trapped in that mountain of debris. I'm told that that VMI graduate paused, he wondered if he could keep going, but he would later say that he reflected back on how VMI had prepared him for life. He took off his hard hat, pulled a sharpie from his pocket, and he wrote on that hard hat a line I think you all know pretty well: ""Never Say Die, VMI!"" And he put the hat back on and went right back to work. (Applause.) Jim Spellman is emblematic of the character that you learn here at VMI. And I'm told the , that that hat is now in the VMI Museum as a , as a tribute. And not just his service, but the extraordinary courage and generosity of first responders and other Americans came to the aid of those that were struck that day. And most importantly, in the proud tradition of VMI, in the wake of that day, 19 years ago tomorrow, many of your alumni answered the call to defend this nation and put on the uniform of the United States. I'll never forget when I went home from Capitol Hill that day: They'd closed all the roads. But that Marine, son of mine, was about six years old; our girls were younger. I found a way to get across the Potomac River to go home to be with my family, to give them comfort before we went back to the work of the nation that day. I'll never forget, as we talked as a family around our little kitchen table, I tried to reassure my children that everything was going to be okay. I started to walk out the kitchen door to go back to Capitol Hill, where meetings were already underway to support our nation's response. And my daughter, Audrey , my youngest, a recent law school graduate and a very insistent type even at age five , she said, ""Dad, I have a question."" And I said, ""Audrey, I have to go. I have to leave."" She said, ""No, daddy. I have a question."" And I said, ""Honey, I have to get back. I've got meetings. I have to get back to the Capitol."" And she stomped her feet and said, ""I have a question."" I went down on one knee and I looked at her and I said, ""What?"" And she said, ""If we have to make a war, do you have to go?"" I put my arms around her and I hugged her, and I said, ""Honey, daddy is too old."" It's hard for me to recite that story without emotion , because it was in that moment, on that day, General, that I thought of those that did have to go, and I've thought of them every day since. Incredible generation of heroes that stepped into the gap and took the fight to our enemies on their soil. There were heroes from VMI in that generation , many. In fact, there would be 12 who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom, who fell in Iraq and Afghanistan. They bore the burden of that day; they hugged their mom and their dads, they hugged their family members goodbye; and they went home to eternity. And we will never forget or fail to honor the graduates of this institution and all of those who have served and fallen in the service of the United States of America. (Applause.) We are grateful to them , the generation of which you are a part, the generation that has defended this nation, lo these last 19 years. And it hasn't just happened. It's been because of the sacrifices that our armed forces have made, the vigilance of law enforcement here in this nation , because we took the fight to the enemy. Your generation has been a part of the fact that we will reach that 19th anniversary of that dark day having had no major terrorist attack on American soil since. It's truly extraordinary. It's a credit to everything that you're learning here. I want to say thank you. I want say thank you to those 12 looking on from eternity. I want to say thank you to all those who put on the uniform from VMI and have served in this generation of heroes. You have made America safer every day. (Applause.) So I came to say thank you, to commend all of you for stepping forward to embrace the kind of education that you're learning here, and to keep open the opportunity to serve your country in new ways in the days ahead. You know, as the father of a Marine Corps captain, and the father-in-law of a Navy lieutenant, who's currently deployed, serving overseas, I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. (Applause.) It's true. Four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts. Our troops hadn't seen a significant pay raise in nearly 10 years. Our military lacked the equipment and the readiness to have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world to meet any moment. Our NATO Allies weren't meeting their commitments to our common defense. Iran was resurgent across the Middle East. And the terrorist organization of ISIS controlled a land mass larger than Pennsylvania. But all that changed when President Donald Trump stepped into the White House. (Applause.) With our strong allies in Congress, this President rebuilt our military. We provided for our active duty personnel the largest pay raise in nearly 10 years. And President Donald Trump signed the largest increase in our national defense since the day of Ronald Reagan. We've rebuilt our military. (Applause.) In fact, we didn't just rebuild our military, restore the arsenal of democracy and give our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission and defend our nation every day. This President actually , with a vision to the future and our national security challenges, President Donald Trump created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years: The United States Space Force. (Applause.) It sounds like we got a few future members in the Space Force with us today. You know, thanks to President Trump, I'm also proud to report our military is now more equipped than ever before. Just in the last three and a half years: 300 new tanks, nearly 500 new F-35 fighter jets on the way, 21 more deployable ships since Election Day 2016 and another 59 are on the way. We've upgraded our tanks, our artillery, our rocket systems. We've bolstered our fleet of attack helicopters and fighter planes. In a very real sense, we've made the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still. (Applause.) And all this matters , all this matters because President Donald Trump and I know the truth of that ancient wisdom that if you want peace, prepare for war. The American people know that weakness arouses evil and a strong America deters it. And under this Commander-in-Chief, we have peace through strength. President Trump is the first President in decades not to get America into a new war. And President Trump has shown that greater peace and stability requires just two things: a strong American military and a President who is willing to act to defend America's interests all over the world. (Applause.) And that's exactly what President Trump did when we took the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. In the last three and a half years, at the direction of their Commander-in-Chief, the Armed Forces of the United States captured the last inch of territory controlled by ISIS, crushed their caliphate, and took down their leader without one American casualty. (Applause.) That's what this President demonstrated when he held firm on the red line. America had said that if Syria used chemical weapons against innocent civilians, that there would be consequences. That red line was ignored , before President Trump arrived at the White House. But when the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people, President Donald Trump responded with overwhelming force and cruise missiles to back down that dictator from using chemical weapons against innocent civilians. (Applause.) And while the last administration sent Iran pallets of cash, President Trump took us out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposed the strongest sanctions on the leading state sponsor terrorism in the world. And when the most dangerous terrorist on the planet threatened American forces, President Donald Trump gave the order to take out Iran's top general. And Qasem Soleimani is gone. (Applause.) For all of those gathered here who will answer the call to serve, for our active duty military who are among us and looking on, I can tell you firsthand: In President Donald Trump, you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back. (Applause.) And with that strong commitment to our national defense and a willingness to use American power to advance American security and interests, our allies are stepping up as never before. I'm proud to report, under the President's leadership, our NATO Allies have already increased their contribution to our common defense by $130 billion; they're projected to rise to $400 billion in just a few short years. And from a standpoint of American strength, we've seen a growing alliance of Middle Eastern countries who are helping to contain Iranian aggression as never before. It all began when the President kept a promise that four previous presidents had made. Literally four presidents in both political parties had made a promise to our most cherished ally. But it was President Donald Trump who he kept that promise when he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. (Applause.) That was a demonstration of our commitment to our cherished ally, Israel. But it was also a demonstration of our commitment to peace. And, in fact, just a few short weeks ago, you could see that that decision set the stage that, for the first time in 26 years, an Arab country has recognized the Jewish State of Israel, and they will be in the Rose Garden next week to sign that agreement. (Applause.) That's leadership. And thanks to the President's leadership, a more peaceful Middle East is within our sights, a more peaceful world within our sights. And that's a world in which brave young men and women like those gathered here will be called upon to maintain the peace, and not contain the chaos. As President Trump said, and I quote, ""the dignity, daring, and devotion of the American military is unrivaled anywhere in history and anyplace in the world."" That's why our President has stood with the men and women of our armed forces and our veterans not just with words, but with deeds. I can tell you firsthand, our President reveres the men and women of our armed forces. Restoring the arsenal of democracy; rebuilding our military; supporting our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard; modernizing our forces; creating the Space Force is all a reflection of the esteem with which your President, this Vice President, and our entire administration hold all of you who aspire to and all of you who serve in the uniform of the United States. It's true. And we've worked to make sure that after your service is done, that we , we've brought reforms to the VA. But, now that , thanks to the President's leadership, we ended years of scandal at the VA. Now the VA itself has more than a 90 percent approval rating, and Veterans Choice is now available to every veteran in America. (Applause.) So it's been about deeds. It's been about supporting our military and our veterans. But I've also seen this President's heart. I've seen this President's heart in countless private moments where I've been able to be at his side. I literally have watched him , after an address at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day when I walked with the President through the grounds, I saw him approach a bereaved mother who was there on that day of days, flowers in hand, who just looked her President in the eye and asked him to always remember the name of her son Jimmy. And I saw this President assure her that he would. I've been there in the Oval Office when the President is on the phone with families of our fallen, making the calls, expressing not only his sympathy, but the deepest sympathies of the American people, paying a debt of honor that we can never fully repay. I've seen it at Dover Air Force Base, been there with the family when our heroes have come home. It's a deeply humbling time to walk into the Family Center, to walk up the families. But I've seen this President, again and again, embrace families and speak of their heroic fallen. And I can tell you, President Donald Trump reveres and honors the members of our armed forces and their families. (Applause.) God bless them all. Abigail Adams said it, ""[Y]our Country will one day call for your services, either in the Cabinet or field. [So] qualify yourself to do honor to her."" You know, over the course of my life, I've concluded that the three most important qualities in any human endeavor are humility, orientation to authority, and self-control. And as I prepare to leave you, I thought I might offer some of that admonition as you continue your academic career here and continue to lead lives of consequence and leadership and service. Now, many of you will enter the service as officers, while others will serve as leaders in other capacities. And these principles apply to whatever your calling is in life. So, first and foremost, I'd encourage you to approach your calling with humility. Consider others as more important than yourself. Take care of the men and women that are serving alongside you. Approach every problem as a listener. As is written long ago, in the words of the Nazarene: Wherever you go, wherever you led, go ""not to be served but to serve."" Be a servant leader. And it all begins with humility. And those of you who serve and those of you who are called, perhaps someday, into conflict should have the same attitude. Have the humility to listen; it's the essence of strong leadership. Secondly, I encourage you to embrace orientation to authority. Respect the unified chain of command. Submit yourself to the authorities placed over you. Trust your superiors. Trust your orders. And through your actions, you will help inspire those you are leading to be better leaders as well. To be a good leader, you must first learn to be a good follower. And finally, practice self-control , something you all at VMI know a little bit about. There's an old proverb that says, ""Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control."" Now, all of you are going through rigorous years of training here at VMI. So I just challenge you, in the years ahead: Don't lose that. Discipline is the foundation of all accomplishment. Be an example of self-discipline to the men and women you lead, whether you answer a calling of leadership in civilian life or in our armed forces. Your discipline will say more about you than your words ever could. To lead others, you must first lead yourself. Now, I'm told VMI's seal depicts Virtue standing, in victory, over a defeated, tyrannical foe. I submit that self-discipline is the wellspring of that victory. It's a virtue that you should cultivate here at VMI not just for a few years, but for a lifetime of accomplishment. And I'm absolutely confident, if you develop and maintain these virtues on an increasing basis in your life, like so many generations who have passed through these hallways before, you will lead lives of consequence and distinction. I promise you. And lastly, I want to challenge you to be men and women of integrity. People follow people that they trust. And so, as you're busy about your lives, as you're making your plans, as you're involved in your studies, take time to develop the inner man and the inner woman. Develop the qualities of character that, again, are the foundation of leadership. You know, I truly do believe if you want to make a difference, be different. It all begins with taking the time to invest in yourself and develop the habits of heart and mind that will pour a foundation in your life to be men and women of integrity, leaders of integrity , leaders who, in the words of your motto, ""In peace, a glorious asset. In war, a tower of strength."" That's from whence it comes. And never forget , never forget, even on the long days here at VMI, in the days of challenge, in the days occasionally where you wonder , you wonder if you can continue to go on , just remember the blessing of being in a place like this. And remember, ""To whom much is given, much will be required."" VMI is providing you an extraordinary education and training in character and leadership. Your parents and your teachers are pouring a strong foundation in your life here. Stand on that foundation, and build not just a career, not just a calling, but build a life that'll serve this nation for generations to come. Because now, more than ever, America needs leaders like VMI to lead our nation forward. (Applause.) So, thank you. Thank you for the privilege of being with you today. It's the greatest honor of my life to serve as your Vice President. And I thank you for the warm welcome. On behalf of your President and a grateful nation, I just came to say we're proud of you, that we're behind you. We honor the learning that you've responded to here. We honor the calling that so many of you are pursuing, and we'll always be grateful. And I leave here today confident that so long as America produces men and women like the cadets of VMI, men and women who are willing and able to stand up and defend our nation and build lives of consequences, I know the best days for America are yet to come. So, thank you and God bless you. God Bless the United States of America. (Applause.) And ""Never Say Die, VMI!"" (Applause.)

Justice Ginsburg led an inspiring life, and her storied career paved the way for women in the law. As an advocate and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, she was a champion for women whose tireless determination reshaped our national life. A fierce defender of her judicial philosophy, Justice Ginsburg will always be remembered as a jurist who respected and commanded the respect of all her colleagues. Karen and I offer our prayers and condolences to the family, friends, and many admirers of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1466755/vice-president-pence-statement-on-the-passing-of-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg&speechType=6	Arts, Entertainment, and History			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-statement-passing-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg/
VSMP299202028	Mike Pence	2020-09-29	Remarks by Vice President Pence After Meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judge Amy Coney Barr ...	speech	Well, on behalf of President Donald Trump, I want to thank the Senate Majority Leader and your colleagues in the Senate who have committed to meet with an extraordinary American. In Judge Amy Coney Barrett, we have someone of great character, of great intellect, who has a judicial philosophy that will uphold the Constitution of the United States. President Trump discharged his duty under Article Two to nominate Judge Barrett to the vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. And now we look forward, our entire team, Leader , working with you, Republicans in the Senate, and we hope Democrats in the Senate, as well , as you discharge your duty to advise and consent. We truly do believe that Judge Barrett represents the best of America personally, in terms of her great intellect and her great background. And we have every confidence that as the American people learn more about Judge Amy Coney Barrett, they will be as inspired as President Trump was when he made her nomination. We believe the Senate has an opportunity, Leader, for a fair and respectful consideration hearing. We urge our Democrat colleagues in the Senate to take the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett and, as the hearing goes forward, to provide the kind of respectful hearing that the American people expect. We look forward to a vote in the Senate in the near future and to fill the seat on the Supreme Court of the United States because the American people deserve a justice like Judge Amy Coney Barrett. And the American people deserve nine justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. So, thank you, Leader, for the warm welcome today, and we look forward to working with you.

VSMP1311202027	Mike Pence	2020-11-13	Remarks by Vice President Pence at Young America's Foundation's Fall College Retreat and President's Club Weekend  ...	speech	"Well, hello, Young America's Foundation! (Applause.) It's really great to be with all of you. My thanks to , how about another round of applause? , I know he's coming into responsibilities here at YAF, but I have to tell you, for me, he is the most admired conservative in America: Governor Scott Walker, everybody. Would you thank you one more time? (Applause.) But to Governor Walker and to all the great conservative leaders who are here today of every age and every background, it is great to kick off the 2020 Fall College Retreat at Young America's Foundation. Thank you all for the honor of being with you today. I also want to extend greetings to a man who literally, for the last 42 years, has built this organization up from the ground level , now 500 chapters all across America. I know he'll be hanging up his spurs, and maybe he'll be hanging them up at the Reagan Ranch. But he deserves a round of applause whether he's here or not. Join me in thanking YAF President Ron Robinson. What an amazing man. (Applause.) But as I said, he'll , he'll pass the torch to someone who I got to know when I was Governor of the State of Indiana and someone who demonstrated in his years as Governor of Wisconsin and in every year since that he's one of the most clarion voices for the conservative agenda in America. And I know those are going to be big shoes to fill when Ron Robinson ends his tenure at YAF in February, but I know that Governor Scott Walker will lead this organization with great distinction. It's my great honor to be here at the first conference in anticipation of his new leadership. I'm also delighted to be here , I understand he's going to be speaking shortly after me, but we're all holding onto hope that Burgess Owens is going to be the next great congressman from the State of Utah. Where are you, Burgess? (Applause.) It's an honor to be here with him and great to be with you all. And speaking of friends of mine, I just left the office of another friend of mine and a man who, when I told him that I was coming to speak to YAF, he went, ""Oh!"" (Laughter.) And I think he , I think he just looked a little bit jealous. So allow me to bring greetings and gratitude from a champion of conservative thought and a champion of young conservatives across America; I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) But being with all of you today, it just makes me think, for so many years, I'm , I'm actually , I'm fortunate to be joined on my team by some YAFers in their youth. My own Chief of Staff, Marc Short, who may well be in the room, in the line of sight, is an old Young America's Foundation person. And you might also know , he's backstage , but the president's chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, is an old YAFer. So if you ever wonder if YAF is going to launch you into positions of (inaudible) spend time in the West Wing, don't ever doubt it. You could give them a round of applause. They're special guys as well. (Applause.) But I've long admired and , I've long admired Young America's , Young Americans for Freedom, I have to tell you. This is an organization not just a stewardship, of , of the Reagan Ranch that my young family and I visited about 15 years ago, but the stewardship of the conservative agenda for young people on campuses all across America , advancing the cause of individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional moral values. And each and every one of you are rising leaders in this generation that have embraced that agenda. And I'm seeing all these great young faces out here today, but how about a round of applause for all the supporters of YAF who are also here with us as well? (Applause.) Thank you for your generosity to this cause. But I came here today not just to help you kick off your , your Fall Retreat, but also I came here today simply to say thank you. Thank you for the incredible support that YAFers have provided to our administration every step of the way these past four years. And as our election contest continues in courts across America, I want to promise you: We are going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted and until every illegal vote is thrown out. (Applause.) And whatever the outcome at the end of the process, I promise you: We will never stop fighting to make America great again. (Applause.) I mean, it's amazing to think , it's amazing to think what took place on Election Day with the support of all of you. While we're continuing to work through the courts process and , and with, I was told this morning, over 1,000 very capable lawyers in America to make sure that we have integrity in our vote. But think about what's already been recognized: This President actually secured 72 million votes. That was more than , 10 million more votes than we received in 2016. In fact, it's more votes than any Republican candidate or any incumbent President in the history of the United States of America. And what maybe meant the most to the President and me is that the vote that came in on November the 3rd for this Republican President actually included the highest proportion of American minority voters in 60 years. (Applause.) And it wasn't just the numbers in our race. Because of the support that all of you provided in all the states from which you come, we actually already have added 12 seats to the House of Representatives. And we , we won three state houses. And give us just a little bit more than a month; we're going to win two Senate seats in the great state of Georgia and hold the Senate majority for the Republican Party. (Applause.) Are you with me on that? (Applause.) I mean, it really is incredible, men and women, all that we've accomplished to date. And even with the election contest that's underway at the presidential level, I think we have so much to celebrate, and it's a reflection of the work that all of you have done. But I also wanted to share with you for just a few minutes about why we fight and why we continue to fight. You know, I turn on the cable television stations and it seems like there's a lot of handwringing on a couple of them about why are we having this election contest. And , and I want to address that to each one of you. It's because it , really, it's about protecting the integrity of the ballot, it's about preserving what we have accomplished and have yet to do, and it's all about preventing the other side from undoing all the progress that we've made in making America great again. First and foremost, why we fight: It's about protecting the integrity of the ballot. You know, men and women of YAF, I think you all know the right to vote is central to our republic. It has been defended by generations of American heroes in uniform. And any time that , that a fraudulent vote enters the ballot, it , it literally cancels the honest vote of an American , an honest vote that was won and fought for in generations of warfare by this country. And so we're going to stand to preserve the integrity of the vote. We're going to , we're going to fight for an outcome in this election that wins us four more years. But we're also going to fight to ensure that we respect the honest and legal vote of every American for this generation and the next. (Applause.) The American people deserve nothing less. I mean, you all know, the liberal media doesn't get to pick our President; the American people do. And we're going to make sure , we're going to make sure that the American people's choice prevails in this presidential election. (Applause.) So that's first and foremost why we're fighting right now. But we're also fighting to preserve everything that we've accomplished. It really is amazing to think about what we have done in the last four years. And I say that with a little swirl of my hand because I picked that up off the President. I've lost count of the number of times that people would come into the Oval Office and say to the President, ""Thank you for what you've done."" And he would always , he gets his ha- , just, ""We."" I mean, this is a President that , that understands that everything that we've been able to accomplish, it's because of the support of tens of millions of Americans who knew we could be strong again, who knew we could be prosperous again if we re-grounded our nation in all the ideals and principles that have always made America great. But, I mean, think about it: Four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world. And , and, as you all know well, we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values and freedoms. But under President Donald Trump, in four short years, we rebuilt our military; we restored the arsenal of democracy; we revived our economy, secured our border, supported law enforcement, and stood for life, liberty, and the Constitution of the United States of America. (Applause.) I mean, think about it. And I , you know, and I , and some of you know that I , I've got three kids about your all's age, and one of them is a United States Marine, and my daughter is married to a Navy pilot who's currently deployed. So I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. It's true. We're finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard, and Space Force the resources they need to defend this nation. (Applause.) And with that renewed American strength, you all saw the story unfold over the last four years , and particularly over the last year and a half. At the direction of this Commander-in-Chief, it was , it was America's Armed Forces, working with our allies in the region, that took down the ISIS caliphate, captured the last inch of territory under the black flag of ISIS, and took down their leader, Baghdadi, without one American casualty. (Applause.) And it wasn't just the caliphate and their leader. It was in January of this year, when I was there, when President Trump made the decision, when we had in our sights the most dangerous terrorist in the world. And because of our armed forces, and because of the decisiveness of our President, Qasem Soleimani is gone. (Applause.) So we've , we've stood up to our enemies, but we also stood with our allies with that renewed strength as well. And I have to tell you, having long been a champion of our most cherished ally, I couldn't be more proud , after four previous Presidents promised to do it and then didn't, I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who kept his promise to the American people and he moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. (Applause.) And here at home, this , this is a President, as Governor Walker just said, who also kept his word to revive this economy. Where the last administration tried to tax and regulate and bail us back to a growing economy, it was President Donald Trump who cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history. We unleashed American energy. We're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. And we fought for free and fair trade, renegotiated our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico, and the result was 7 million jobs created in just three years and wages rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Freedom works. (Applause.) I mean, the truth is that all of those policies unleashed an American renaissance , in job creation, small businesses, American energy, and exports. And , and all along the way, this President has stood for the rule of law, principles so cherished by Young Americans for Freedom and conservatives across the country. And chief among those things, we've stood with those who've , who've protected and served our families every single day. And President Donald Trump, every single day, has stood with the men and women of law enforcement. We back the blue, and we back men and women who will stand with those in law enforcement. (Applause.) And all along the way, this President also kept his promise that, again, my friend Scott was talking about. I remember , I remember when , when President Trump pulled out the list, with good counsel from , from friends at Federalist Society and elsewhere. And he said, ""This is a list from which we will draw if there are openings on the Supreme Court."" And the truth is that we drew from that list and that steady counsel, and we've actually appointed more than 220 conservatives to our federal courts at every level, and they are all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. (Applause.) And that includes Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) Isn't she great? Isn't she great? I'm telling you what , not just because she's from Indiana. Right? (Laughter.) How much did you love it when they said, ""Would you show us what's on that paper in front of you?"" Nothing. (Laughs.) Just an amazing, principled person. But I'm telling you, Judge Barrett , now Justice Barrett , Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Gorsuch, they're just emblematic of over 200 principled jurists who are on our courts at every level, strengthening the foundation under- , underpinning our Constitution in the judiciary. In fact, I hope some of you have the opportunity, in the midst of this conference, to take some time to listen to Justice Alito's speech at the Federalist Society last night. He said, and I quote, ""We have never before seen restrictions as severe and prolonged as those [that have been] experienced"" on freedom in the year 2020. He said things that were ""previously unimaginable restrictions"" on our freedom of speech and on religious liberty , had taken place. Justice Alito's admonition last night is an admonition I think every YAFer should embrace. And that is, he said, ""We need to do whatever we can to prevent [our fundamental freedoms] from becoming second-tier constitutional rights."" The good news is this great organization, Young America's Foundation , Young Americans for Freedom , have already been in that fight from the very beginning. It was YAF that led the fight against California's Berkeley and stood up, we stood with you, and we won for the freedom of speech on campuses. (Applause.) It was , it was more than a year of litigation, but we were able to prevail. And it's because we understand that the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech , these are the fundamental freedoms of the American people, and so we've stood without apology for those ideals and those values. But probably, more than anything else, I can tell you: Of all the things that I've stood with this Presidentall along the way, I couldn't be more proud to be Vice President to a President who has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life. (Applause.) I mean, it was amazing. From very early on, the President reinstituted what's known as the ""Mexico City policy."" We prevented any taxpayer dollars from going to provide or promote abortion anywhere around the world. It was President Trump , it was President Trump who took steps necessary, we advanced legislation, and I actually got to cast the tiebreaking vote, as President of the Senate, to allow states across America to defund Planned Parenthood, and President Trump signed it into law. (Applause.) Because of your support, because of all of your efforts over the last four years, we , I've had the opportunity to serve alongside the most pro-life President in American history. And make no mistake about it: Whether it's , whether it's in the hallways of the Congress; whether it be in the , in the hallways of our judiciary; whether it be in the quiet and compassionate hallways of crisis pregnancy centers around America; because of all of your work, life is winning in America, and I believe we will restore the sanctity and the right to life to the center of America's law. (Applause.) I believe it with all my heart. And in the midst of all of that, the American people have witnessed, in the last year, this President's leadership, as our nation was struck from China by the worst pandemic in 100 years. But from very early on, the American people saw the decisiveness of our President writ-large. He suspended all travel from China, the second-largest economy in the world. We stood up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. And as I stand here today, even as we've seen cases rising across the Midwest, the report again I received this morning is still true today: No American who has ever required a ventilator has ever been denied a ventilator. No American who has ever required an ICU bed has ever been denied an ICU bed. We've sped medicines to the marketplace, including last week from a great Indiana company, that are literally saving lives every day. And you all saw the news: Pfizer and very soon another company, we believe, are going to go to the FDA with the first coronavirus vaccine, and we believe we'll be distributing tens of millions of doses of that vaccine before the year is out. (Applause.) So we fight because it's right to fight to preserve the integrity of the vote. We fight because of all that we've accomplished and the great progress we've made as a nation and all we have yet to do. But we also fight, men and women, because of , because we need, whether it be in our election or whether it be in the upcoming runoffs in Georgia , we fight to ensure that we have a check on all the Democrats on the American left want to do to undo the progress that we have made. And make no mistake about it , I know , I know you get a little tired , even all these bright young people get a little tired after election season, and I know you all worked very hard. The truth is, I'm headed down to Georgia next week, and I'll be going down again and again, and we have got to roll our sleeves up. And just as earnestly as we are working to reelect President Trump for four more years, we got to make sure that we reelect a Republican majority in the United States Senate and the majority path goes straight through Georgia. (Applause.) So get ready. I mean, it's great to be here at this Young America's Foundation Retreat, but I hope you get a little retreat, you get a little refreshed, and then, if you can, hit the road. (Laughs.) All roads point south, okay? Go find a place to get involved and knock on the door because it , their , you know, our agenda is about American greatness, and I really do believe their agenda will lead to American decline. I believe it with all my heart. I mean, where we're opening up again, they got people on their team that are already talking about locking down America again. Where we cut taxes, rolled back regulation, we advanced more freedom , they're talking about literally raising taxes right out of the gate, growing government, and returning to an activist court, defense cuts that , the likes of which we inherited when we came into office. We know what their agenda is, and if they , if they find a way to gain control of the White House and the United States Senate, as they hold the House of Representatives even by a narrow majority, their agenda is higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, a Green New Deal, abortion on demand, defunding the police, and packing the courts. But we're not going to let it happen, right? (Applause.) Young Americans, we're going to do everything in our power to see this President reelected under the under the color of the law, and we'll pursue every right and legal remedy. But we all need to do everything in our power to make sure that we win that majority in Georgia as well. And so I appreciate the opportunity to come and chat with you today and to break loose from some of our duties. We'll be , we'll be talking in the Rose Garden a little bit later this afternoon about progress that we're making in dealing with the coronavirus and advancing a vaccine to millions , tens of millions of Americans just around the corner. But I want to give you a word of encouragement, and that is: I want to urge all of you to stay in the fight and have faith. I love a quote somebody sent me the other day from Corrie ten Boom. She wrote, ""Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to known God."" Right? We don't know what the future holds, but, for me, in my house, we know who holds the future. And so I just want to encourage you to be encouraged. (Applause.) Stay in the fight for integrity in our elections all the way through this contest through which we're passing in our courts, and then after that, to make sure that , that we improve our electoral system in this country so that every American can be confident that every legal vote is counted. Stay in the fight for a Republican majority in the Senate to reelect Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. In a word, just stay in the fight for freedom. You know, the fight for freedom never ends. You know, I've been , I've been laboring in the vineyards of the conservative movement since I had hair the same color as yours. (Laughter.) And, frankly, I started out in politics as a Democrat. I was actually the Youth Democrat Party coordinator in Bartholomew County, Indiana, in 1975, when I was a sophomore in high school. It's true. I was kind of a ""community organizer,"" truth be told. (Laughter.) But then, I started to hear the voice of this movie actor who had run for President. I started to hear the ideals that he was expressing , the belief in individual freedom and a strong national defense and traditional values and the liberties enshrined in our Constitution. And I , I became a Republican. I never looked back. In fact, the first time I ran for Congress , I was young then, too , it was back in 1988. It was his last year in office, and I actually got to sit with the man that I like to call my second-favorite President. (Laughter.) And I sat down in the Blue Room, across from President Reagan. And it was one of these candidate lineups where you go in and you get to sit down for a few minutes, and they roll a little video, and then they take a , take a picture. And I was with my young bride , still my bride today , our great Second Lady Karen Pence. (Applause.) But some capable campaign staffer, like one of you, had handed me a sheet that I ought to talk about some road or some bridge or a bridge that needed a road in Indiana or something. I don't know. And I turned to Karen and I said, ""You know, he's the reason I'm a Republican. I feel like I'd just like to say something from my heart."" And Karen just looked at me and she said, ""You just tell him whatever you want to tell him."" So I sat down, very nervous. You can see a picture of it online, if you want. It's easy to find. And I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, ""Mike, how's the campaign going?"" And I said, ""Well, I got something I'd like to say to you."" And he said, ""Okay."" And I said, ""I just want to thank you for everything you've done to inspire my generation of Americans to believe in this country again."" And he looked at me and, for as long as I live, I'll , I'll believe that, in that moment, the 40th President of the United States blushed. And he said, ""Well, Mike, that's a very nice thing of you to say."" (Laughter.) And it was like he'd never heard it before, and I know he had. But the truth was, when I was your age, I had , I had come of age watching , watching heroes of mine, in my youth, cut down in the streets. You know, the heroes of my youth were John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., when I was a little boy in the 60s, and I saw the Vietnam War unfurl in front of us, and then we saw Watergate. But when President Reagan came along, he just reminded my generation that we could be great again. And I can't help but think that President Trump has had the same impact on each and every one of you. He's just reminded you what real leadership looks like , what strong, unapologetic American leadership looks like on the world stage; about the difference that one person can make if they hew to the ideals and principles that have always made this country great. And I have to tell you, it's , I really hope, in the days ahead, that you'll , you'll take this experience and you'll carry that in your own careers and in your own lives not just from being active in Young America's Foundation, but as conservatives at home. And don't resist the call to step forward and put your name on the ballot as well. Because I have a sense every single one of you would be a credit to the nation if you'd step forward and make that sacrifice. That's what I mean by ""Stay in the fight."" Stay in the fight every day in the days that are unfolding in front of us now and the history that's being written. Stay in the fight by heading from here straight down to Georgia and making a difference. But stay in the fight. Stay in the fight for freedom every day of your life. Because the fight for freedom never ends. And remember this: Never forget that the Bible says, ""Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."" Which means any time that we make freedom our cause , defending it, upholding it, expanding it , we make His work on this Earth our very own, and it also means a freedom always wins. So stay in the fight. Stay in the fight for America. Stay in the fight for freedom. And looking out at all these bright and shining faces, I know the best days for the conservative movement and the best days for America are yet to come. Thank you all very much. God bless you. God bless YAF. And we'll see you there. (Applause.)

VSMP812202026	Mike Pence	2020-12-08	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit	speech	"Well, thank you all very much. Paul, thank you for those kind words and for your tireless work at Health and Human Services. To Secretary Azar , really, our host for the day , we thank you for your extraordinary leadership and your , I think he deserves a round of applause. Secretary Alex Azar. (Applause.) We've been shoulder to shoulder for 10 months in all of this, and the President and I couldn't be more grateful for the entire team at HHS and all of the people that you've heard from today.I especially want to express my appreciation to Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis, Governor Lee, and Governor Edwards. I hope, in that panel that you just heard, you understood that was just a sampling of a seamless partnership that we have forged with states across the country to put the health of America first. And, Governors, we're truly grateful. We're truly grateful. (Applause.) To other members of the Cabinet who are with us today, members of Congress, to mayors and state and local officials, especially health officials from around the country: Thank you. Thank you for your role in bringing us to the precipice of a breakthrough in American medicine and in the life and health of the American people. We are literally days away from the fulfillment of the vision of Operation Warp Speed, and I want to thank you for participating. And I want to thank all of you who've looked on from afar to take in this vaccine summit. As you heard today over the last several hours, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump; the tireless efforts of health officials at the federal level and at the state level around the country; the ingenuity of great research companies, military personnel, our private sector partners; and the cooperation of the American people, we are literally, we believe, in all likelihood, just a few days away from the approval and distribution of the first coronavirus vaccine in America. That is warp speed. (Applause.) From the first day the President stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force and asked us to lead it, we had one mission, and that is to save American lives. And I believe the advance that we're about to fulfill and to begin to move out on will continue that mission apace and put us one day closer to the day we put the coronavirus in the past. But before I reflect on all that we've heard today and the extraordinary professionalism and cooperation that you've witnessed, I want to extend my sympathies to the families that may be looking on at this very hour , families that have lost loved ones over the course of this year. Even as we enter a time of great promise in this country, I want families that have lost loved ones and those that are still struggling in the midst of this pandemic to know there's not a day gone by that you haven't been on the hearts of all of us working at every level, and we will never forget your families or your loved ones as we hasten the day that we put this pandemic in the past. Because of the efforts of all of those you've heard from today and, frankly, countless others, we literally are on track to distribute tens of millions of doses of the coronavirus vaccine before the end of this month. We're about to make history. And together, we're going to continue to save lives across this country with the approval of the first coronavirus vaccine. We believe it is likely within days. As I said, we are one step closer to the day that, as a people, we will put this pandemic in the past and, as the President said from this very podium today, that America will continue to do our part to help families and peoples around the world. From the very beginning, I hope it is evident to all of you that President Trump's vision to our nation's response was not just a whole-of-government approach, but it's been a whole-of-America approach, meeting all of the challenges that we faced from early on. We reinvented testing, we saw to the delivery of billions of medical supplies and equipment, we developed new medicines and therapeutics, and now just days away from the approval and distribution of millions of doses of this vaccine. I must tell you, having been working every single day over the last 10 months toward this objective: As an American, as your Vice President, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I'm humbled and I'm very grateful for what the American people have accomplished. I'm grateful for the leadership of our President, the tireless efforts of all the health officials that have worked every step of the way. I'm , I'm grateful for the ingenuity of the great research companies all across this great nation and for the compassion of our people. After today's summit, I suspect more people than ever around the country will look at the progress that we are about to fulfill in Operation Warp Speed, and they will say, as I have said before, ""Only in America."" (Applause.) We are honored to have all of you to participate , and all of you looking on , to participate in this vaccine summit. The President wanted to convene this gathering to inform the American people of the progress that we've made in Operation Warp Speed, but also to give credit where credit is due. Operation Warp Speed is a modern American miracle, but it's an accomplishment of all of the American people. It's amazing to think that the average development timeline for a vaccine can take 8 to 12 years. But as you heard today, we're on track to accomplish a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine in 8 to 12 months. Before Operation Warp Speed, the fastest prior vaccine development in the United States took over four years. But as the President said earlier today, we've developed a gold standard vaccine in just nine months. Only in America. (Applause.) And the dates speak for themselves. January 10th, we reserved , we received the first sequence of the coronavirus vaccine. Literally the next day, scientists went to work with private research companies and the National Institute of Health to begin to develop a vaccine. Within six weeks, which was also record time, we were already in phase one clinical trials. And with the support of many of the members of Congress that you saw here today, we , we were able to secure some $10 billion to develop a vaccine. But it would be in May of this year that the President launched Operation Warp Speed that you have heard in great detail today. The President said then that they were looking to get a vaccine by the end of the year. But in August, President Trump made a promise. He actually said, and I quote, ""We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year."" And here we are. The President's promise was met with considerable skepticism not only in the scientific community, but across the public debate. But as we stand here today and we celebrate what we believe is the likely approval of two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines, the American people deserve to know that there are actually four vaccine candidates in large, phase three clinical trials as we speak. Operation Warp Speed, we believe, is about to commence, it's about to save lives, and it will continue to expand, to the benefit of the American people and the world. (Applause.) We're moving at record speed, but the American people can be confident that while , while we have cut red tape, we've cut no corners; and our standards for safety and effectiveness are just as rigorous as they have ever been. And the American people can be encouraged , those that will have opportunities in this initial phase to take the vaccine can be confident that the approval has ensured that this vaccine is not just effective, but is safe. And as you heard today as well, beyond the development of this extraordinary American medical miracle, that once the vaccine is approved, we are in a position, with the great work of General Perna and the American military and our private sector partners, to literally ship millions of doses across the country within 24 hours. But ultimately, the distri- , the decision about where the vaccines are distributed is up to governors. And that's why the final panel today was so important. It's important for the American people to know that from very early on, we have operated against the philosophy that this is a , this is a national response to this pandemic that is federally supported but state managed and locally executed. And we've deferred, in this instance, as we have throughout this pandemic, to the judgment of governors all across the nation , the states and the territories of this country , who are best equipped to know the point of the need in their state. And how about another round of applause for the governors that you heard from today? We're truly grateful. (Applause.) Operation Warp Speed, like all the we have done, has not just been a whole-of-government approach at every level, but it is, as I said, a whole-of-America approach. And you , you heard today from some of the nation's top logistics and shipping companies , one of which I witnessed firsthand visiting Governor Lee's great state of Tennessee last week, at the headquarters of FedEx. But FedEx, UPS, and McKesson are going to serve as a critical link getting the vaccine to the point of the need. And what's important for the American people to understand is , is that we're not reinventing the wheel here. These are companies that , that have already, in the past, particularly in McKesson's case, been involved in distributing millions of vaccines across America. We're just building a bigger wheel, but building on top of the experience that we have. So how about a big round of applause for those great logistics companies that are about to partner for the health of the American people? (Applause.) As you also heard, we've called on companies like CVS and Walgreens to be able to deliver and administer vaccines. And we actually , it's remarkable. I heard this at the White House Coronavirus Task Force just this past week: We are in a position , because of these great American companies and retailers, we're in a position to administer vaccines to 99 percent of America's nursing homes onsite, free of charge, the moment the vaccines arrive. (Applause.) Only in America. But Warp Speed , I want to say, as I close , is really just emblematic of , of the approach that President Trump took from very early on in the midst of this pandemic. We launched the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. We've reinvented testing from a standing start. It's amazing to think: When I was tapped to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we'd done less than 10,000 coronavirus tests in America. Today, we do roughly 2 million a day and have done more than 200 million coronavirus tests, giving us greater visibility on the impact of the pandemic and , and those who are in harm's way. We marshalled the full power of the American economy early on, not just in this project, but in the development of PPE and equipment. We literally saw to the manufacture and delivery of billions of medical supplies. And while we see cases rising and hospitalization rising across the country, with our team on the ground here working closely with governors, we literally are able to track hospital capacity on a hospital-by-hospital basis, and we're going to continue to work around the clock to make sure our hospitals and our healthcare workers have the PPE and supplies they need to give any American family the same level of care that we'd want a member of our family to have. (Applause.) The story of therapeutics is also an extraordinary one. I remember, in early March, when we gathered all the great research companies together in the Cabinet Room and the President challenged each and every one of them not only to go to work on a vaccine, but to go to work on the development of medicines , therapeutics that would give people relief who were impacted by the coronavirus. And as we stand here today, the FDA has literally approved dozens and dozens of lifesaving therapeutics. And I'm actually told that we've already delivered 185,000 doses of therapeutics to coronavirus patients across America. It's extraordinary. (Applause.) And the truth is, even as we see cases rising around the country and hospitalizations rising, I want the American people to know that we've never been better prepared to combat the coronavirus than we are today. This is a time of great promise and hope for the American people. But, that being said, with the rising cases across America, it's also a time of renewed vigilance. As we close today what is, I know, for all of us gathered here and all of those looking on, a time of great promise, a time of great encouragement, the American people should know that we all still have work to do , that every single one of us has a role to play. With cases rising and hospitalizations rising in virtually every jurisdiction around America, it's time once again to redouble our efforts to put the health of our families, our neighbors, and our communities first. And we all know what to do. The American people demonstrated, in the early days of March and April, that we know how to slow the spread. We know how to flatten the curve. We know how to save lives. Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands. Practice social distancing or wear a mask when it's not possible or whenever local authorities indicate that it's appropriate. It's the way that we got through the early days of this pandemic and we flattened the curve, saved lives. It's the way we got through the Sun Belt outbreak. And it's the way we'll see our way through the , the months ahead between now and when the coronavirus vaccine that will likely be approved this week will be widely available for every American. The President often says , and it's more obvious today than maybe ever before , we are rounding the corner. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But to reach the end of the tunnel and to save American lives, we just need to redouble our efforts. We have a ways to go, America. So I just want to encourage you all to be patient in the days ahead. My wife and I ran a marathon , about 10 years ago. (Laughter.) And the records in that marathon were all intact when we finished. And I will tell you, they told us, when we were running, that the last five miles of a marathon are the toughest. You come around that corner and , after the 21st mile , and you're absolutely convinced that you never felt better in your life. You can see the finish line, and then your legs start to tighten up. You know, the truth of the matter is, we've been running a marathon in this country, haven't we? But I want the American people know the finish line is around the corner. We could see it from here. And by , by the spring, we anticipate , or shortly thereafter , we'll have a , what we believe will be multiple safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for every American that wants one. But we got to get there. And so I want to encourage you from the bottom of my heart to continue to be diligent to put your health, your family's health, and your community's health first. I can't help but think of that ancient verse that says, ""Do not grow weary in well doing, for, in the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."" Now's the time for us to stay focused, be encouraged. Because the extraordinary innovation, the dedication of health officials at every level, these great research companies, our extraordinary private partners , we are literally on the cusp of putting the coronavirus in the past. We are coming very close in the days ahead, I believe, to the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic in America. But it , but it will yet be months to go. We have miles to go before we sleep. And so we encourage you all to continue to do your part. But I have every confidence that with the dedication of all the officials represented here so well at every level; with programs like Operation Warp Speed; with the dedication of our healthcare workers and our first responders, of researchers around the country; and with the cooperation of the American people, we'll get through this. I have every confidence. I have faith that with your help and with God's grace, we will heal our land, and we will heal our land together. Thank you all very much. Thank you for being a part of this important summit. And God bless you all. (Applause.)"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1489639/remarks-by-vice-president-pence-at-the-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit&speechType=1	Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/
VSMP1612202025	Mike Pence	2020-12-16	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Life is Winning Event	speech	"Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. And today is really about , really about celebrating the progress we've made in the cause for life and also thanking the leaders that are gathered in this room, and all of you that'll be looking on livestream around the country, for the way that you've stood. You've stood for life for the last four years, and I promise you we will never stop fighting for the right to life. (Applause.) And on behalf of the President of the United States and the First Family, welcome to the White House. It's good to have you here on a blustery day and good to be here with so many very special people. But as I begin, allow me to bring greetings, as you all have been very kind to me today. Let me bring greetings from a man who from early on in this administration, and as a candidate, made it clear that he would stand up for the sanctity of human life. And allow me to give you the opportunity to thank the most pro-life president in American history. I bring greetings from President Donald Trump. (Applause.) Even before our inauguration four years ago, President Trump wrote to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in words that I believe are well to reflect on today. He said, ""I believe it is the most basic duty of government to guard the innocent."" With that in mind, he made it clear and he said, ""I will veto any legislation that weakens current pro-life federal policies or encourages the destruction of innocent human life at any stage."" And President Donald Trump has kept his word every single day. (Applause.) But I wanted to thank all of you, on the President's behalf and on my own behalf, for all that each one of you have done in the cause of life over the last four years. You'll hear from this podium today the milestones that we've marked together. It's all been because of all of you and because of the literally tens of millions of Americans who have labored in the cause for life since that dark day in 1973. But there are specific heroes in the room that I want to acknowledge who are with us today. I mean, to be able to serve in the role of Vice President, you also get to be President of the Senate. You get an up-close look at members of the United States Senate. You see their values when the cameras are off. You see their principles. And there are probably no two more stalwart conservatives in the United States Senate, no two greater champions for the right to life than Senator James Lankford and Senator Steve Daines. Would you join me in thanking the both of them for their great leadership for life? (Applause.) And there's a woman in the room who I got to know when she was a staff director for the pro-life caucus in Congress. She is , has emerged as maybe one of the most effective pro-life leaders in the United States of America. Join me in thanking Marjorie Dannenfelser. (Applause.) And he did some time in the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and now he's emerged as one of the leading voices for life and liberty around the country. And he's never changed. Senator Jim DeMint, thank you so much for your strong stand for this movement all these many years. (Applause.) And let me also , let me also acknowledge someone who worked back in the Reagan administration, was , Brooke, you'll be glad to know , was the chief domestic policy advisor. He would go on in organizations like the Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, and now president of American Values, and a stalwart an eloquent champion for life. Gary Bauer, we thank you for your leadership and your support. (Applause.) We're joined today by more than , members of more than 20 pro-life organizations who have supported President Trump and our administration and the cause for life all along the way. And so, again, our thanks to the Susan B. Anthony List, the Students for Life, to March for Life Action, to Focus on the Family, to Concerned Women for America, and Family Research Council, and all of you who have organized and mobilized around America for the sanctity of life. Give yourselves a round of applause, would you, please? (Applause.) Well, like all of you gathered here today, I've long believed that a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable: the aged and the infirm, the disabled and the unborn. President Trump said early in our administration, and I quote, ""Every person is worth protecting. Every human life, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of Almighty God."" In this administration, it's always been about life. And that's been evident in the last year, as our nation has passed through this challenging time of a global pandemic. When the President asked me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force , I'll never forget the day , he said, ""Mike, I want you to step down; I want you to work with our outstanding health leadership all across this administration, across the country, with one mission"" , and that was to save lives. We launched the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. We reinvented testing. Some 200 million tests have been performed across America , some 2 million a day. We saw to the production and the distribution of literally billions of supplies, of personal protective equipment. And all along the way, this President and this team were in a relentless drive to save lives. We've created medicines in record speed. And as the world learned last week, we have come to the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic, and people are already receiving the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine all across America. (Applause.) Secretary Azar and I were in Indiana yesterday at a distribution facility and manufacturing plant that will , with the approval of FDA, we hope this week , literally be distributing millions more of a new vaccine that could well be approved for the American people. I mention all of that today because it is just emblematic of an administration that has counted the lives of every one of our citizens precious and important. And that's animated our response to this pandemic, but it's animated the progress that we've made in this administration every step of the way in the cause for life. As Brooke just mentioned, when the President took office, one of the very first things he did was reinstate the Mexico City Policy, ending government funding for promoting abortions around the world. And before long, we expanded it to more countries and more policies on the planet. And he gave me the great privilege, in our very first month in office, to be the first Vice President in history to ever address the March for Life on the National Mall. And this last January, he did it himself: President Trump spoke to the March for Life. (Applause.) And before we took office, you all know that the largest abortion provider in America was also the largest recipient of federal funding under Title 10. The year before we took office, we actually witnessed, along with the American people, the undercover videos that showed horrific conversations about the sale and transfer of parts of aborted babies. It's just unconscionable. But thanks to President Trump's leadership, in March of 2017, I had the honor of casting the tiebreaking vote in the United States Senate to allow every state in America to defund Planned Parenthood, and President Trump signed it into law. (Applause.) And putting that priority on the unborn, just last summer, with the strong support of leaders in this room, and the full support of our Secretary of Health and Human Services, President Trump ended fetal tissue research at the National Institutes for Health. We will always stand for the right to life and the dignity of the unborn. (Applause.) So we've made great progress all along the way, but perhaps it's , it's altogether fitting, with two , these two great senators in the room and one former senator in the room to talk about the really extraordinary progress that we've made in the courts across this land. As a candidate, President Trump promised the American people: He said, quote, ""I will protect life. And the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people in the Court."" He said, and he promised, ""I will appoint judges that will be pro-life."" And that's just what he's done. (Applause.) As Brooke said, with yesterday's confirmation of the judge who will fill the seat of the newest justice on the Supreme Court, President Trump has appointed more than 220 conservatives to our federal courts at every level, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (Applause.) And I promise you, having had the opportunity to meet so many of these , not just the justices, but the judges, every one of these men and women are principled conservatives who will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in our founding documents and in our Bill of Rights. It's truly a legacy that will reach generations, and it's a testament to what each one of you have done. Your support for this administration, your counsel along the way as those decisions were made by our President , whether it be in policies in health, whether it be in , whether it be in decisions that were made about appointments to the court , I hope you all know, and I believe with all my heart, that everyone in this room, right along with our President, has made a difference for life. So today, we really gather to reflect on the great progress we've made for life under President Donald Trump and with all of your collective support, but also to thank all of you and to urge you, as we promise, to never stop fighting for the cause for life. I believe what we have demonstrated over these past four years is that when men and women who cherish the sanctity of life come together, let their voices be heard; when we rally behind great leaders at every level who will stand without apology for life, we can make extraordinary progress. And I truly do believe if all of us continue to do all that we can in the months and the years ahead, we will see the sanctity of life restored to the center of American law in our time. (Applause.) I truly believe it. So to all the champions for life: Thank you for all you've done. On behalf of the President, on behalf of our entire administration, we're grateful to each and every one of you. And it's been our great honor to serve alongside you, and we'll continue to fight alongside with you. For all the time that we have and all of my days that remain on this Earth, I will always stand for life, and I'll always stand with each and every one of you. That's my solemn promise. And it's not just about , not just about each one of you. I know what all of you know as well: that he who said ""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you"" is about life. And we do well in this movement to always remind ourselves that when we make the cause for life our cause, we make His work on this Earth our very own. So do not grow weary in doing well, because in the last four years, we've shown when men and women of faith and conviction come together to stand up for the unborn, to speak out for the voiceless, life can win in America. And with your help and God's help, life will keep on winning in the United States of America. Thank you all very much. God bless you. And honor to be with you today. (Applause.)

VSMP1812202024	Mike Pence	2020-12-18	Remarks by Vice President Pence at a Safe and Effective Vaccine Confidence Event	speech	Well, good morning. And thank you all for being here. I want to thank my wonderful wife, our Second Lady Karen Pence; the Surgeon General; Dr. Tony Fauci; and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force who are joining us here today. I especially want to thank the fine medical team at Walter Reed Hospital that administered our vaccine today. I didn't feel a thing. Well done. And we appreciate your service to the country. You know, as the Christmas holiday approaches, this is always a season of hope. We gather here today, at the end of a historic week, to affirm to the American people that hope is on the way. And Karen and I were more than happy to step forward before this week was out to take the safe and effective coronavirus vaccine that we have secured and produced for the American people. It's a truly inspiring day. As the people of this country witnessed this past week, under Operation Warp Speed, the first coronavirus vaccine is literally being administered in states across the country to millions of Americans. And make no mistake about it: It's a medical miracle. The average vaccine, I'm told by our experts, usually takes between 8 and 12 years to develop and then manufacture and distribute. But we're on track, here in the United States, to administer millions of doses to the American people in less than one year. It is a miracle indeed. And I also believe that history will record that this week was the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic. But with cases rising across the country, with hospitalizations rising across the country, we have a ways to go. And I want to assure the American people that we're going to continue to make sure that our healthcare providers have all the support and resources they need to meet this moment. But vigilance and the vaccine is our way through. And building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning. Ever since I was asked by President Trump to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, I have been inspired by the diligence and energy of our researchers in this country. Early on, the President brought some of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world together in the Cabinet Room and said that we needed medicines, we needed therapeutics, and we needed vaccines, and we needed them in record time. I watched the historic pace with which the dedicated men and women at the FDA worked. But, today, Karen and I wanted to step forward and take this vaccine to assure the American people that while we cut red tape, we cut no corners. And thanks to Operation Warp Speed, thanks to incredible research companies, thanks to the great work at the National Institute of Health, and the great and careful work of the FDA, and the leadership of our President in Operation Warp Speed, the American people can be confident we have one and perhaps, within hours, two safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for you and for your family. And now we're in the process of distributing millions of doses of a safe and effective vaccine all across the country. Working closely with our nation's governors, we've already seen the vaccine delivered to healthcare workers and seniors across the nation. This week, 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been allocated. And next week, 2 million more doses will be distributed across America. And as you all know, yesterday, the FDA advisory panel recommended approval of the Moderna vaccine. And when it is approved, we expect later today, we'll be in a position to ship 5.9 million doses of vaccines all across the country next week. In fact, under Operation Warp Speed, we are poised to have vaccine for 20 million Americans before the end of December. It is truly a medical miracle and an inspiration to people across this country. It is a , it's a tribute as well to the dedication of all of those working at the federal level and the state level who have implemented this project. From early on, President Trump gave the White House Coronavirus Task Force one mission, and that was to save lives. And in the midst of one of the most challenging years in the life of this nation, I truly do believe that, despite the heartbreak and hardship that we have endured as a nation, that we've done just that. Working with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force these last 10 months, we scaled testing. Now we're doing nearly 2 million tests a day and have performed more than 200 million coronavirus tests across America. And the FDA just approved the first over-the-counter coronavirus test for at-home testing for the American people. Working with the great team at FEMA and with the Department of Defense, we identified and distributed literally billions of medical supplies to our doctors and nurses and hospitals, and we'll continue to ensure that all of our caregivers in this country have the resources and the support they need to continue to meet this moment. We saw to the development of therapeutics, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, the good use of steroids, and other methods that have literally saved lives across the country. And as we gather here today, and as we celebrate this week, we secured a safe and effective vaccine that's being distributed all across America. I would be remiss if I didn't take this moment, at the end of this challenging year, simply to say thanks to the men and women who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. You will hear from several of them in just a few moments. But let me give credit where credit is due. I want to thank Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. I want to thank Dr. Robert Redfield and all the great men and women at the CDC. I want to thank Secretary Alex Azar of HHS and Seema Verma at the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. And I also want to thank the great team at FEMA that has stood up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two, and Pete Gaynor, and General Sanford, and all of those that have worked to make sure that the American people and our healthcare workers have the supplies they need has made an extraordinary difference in the life of the nation. I'm also grateful for the steady hand and leadership of Dr. Ben Carson, who has been with us every step of the way. I know I speak for every American when I say , and I speak for our President when I say: Thank you for your service in this year and in the days to come. The truth is, the American people deserve to know that we've never been more prepared to combat the coronavirus than we are today. And even while we see cases rising and hospitalizations rising and heartbreaking losses, we'll continue to marshal the resources that we have secured as a nation, including a safe and effective vaccine to meet this moment. But that being said, it's important that every American remember that all of us have a role to play. The way through this challenging time is vigilance and a vaccine. The day will come when we put the coronavirus in the past, but it will be a combination of all the efforts that I just described: a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people but also the ongoing vigilance of every American. So as we , as we reach this extraordinary and historic moment in the life of our nation, let me urge every American to continue to do your part: Put the health of your family, your neighbors, and your community first; practice good hygiene; wash your hands; practice social distancing, or wear a mask whenever it's indicated, or whenever you're unable to practice distance; and listen to your local authorities. As President Trump often says, we are rounding the corner. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is the light of American innovation and creativity. It is the light of lifesaving medicines and a safe and effective vaccine. After a year of heartbreak and hardship, the American people can be encouraged. And Karen and I hope this step today will be a source of confidence and of comfort to the American people that thanks to all the men and women who have operated under Operation Warp Speed, that we have a safe and effective vaccine and that these days of hardship and heartbreak will, in a day not too far in the distance, will be put in the past. So with gratitude for the American ingenuity of our research companies, with gratitude for the incredible healthcare workers who have met this moment and continue to meet this moment in the life of the nation, with gratitude for all the officials at the federal and state level, and gratitude to our President for his vision with Operation Warp Speed, I'm confident that we will get through this, we will get through this together, and we will heal our land. So thank you all very much. (Applause.)

VSMP1812202023	Mike Pence	2020-12-18	Remarks by Vice President Pence at the Space Force's 1st Birthday Celebration	speech	"South Court AuditoriumEisenhower Executive Office Building4:43 P.M. EST THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for being here today. To Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, to the Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett, to General John Hyten, General Jay Raymond, General James Dickinson, General David Thompson, and General David Allvin: On behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the first anniversary of that branch of our Armed Forces that will ensure for generations that America remains as dominant in space as we are on land and sea and air. Welcome to the first anniversary of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Many kind things have been said about your Vice President, but I have to tell you I am the second-biggest champion of the Space Force in this administration. So as we begin, allow me to bring greetings and first anniversary congratulations from a champion of everyone who wears the uniform of the United States and the founder of the United States Space Force. I bring greetings and congratulations from the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump. (Applause.) We just left the Oval Office with the President. And from the very first moment that he conceived of the idea of creating a new branch of our Armed Forces dedicated to our security in space, he has been an enthusiast, and I can testify , as the Acting Secretary and the Secretary of the Air Force can attest , that enthusiasm has only grown in the last year. And he's proud of each and every one of you, as I am. But we're grateful to the contributions of all of you in this room, and to the speakers who have preceded me at this podium, for bringing us to the fruition of this first year, but, more importantly, bringing us to this day, a year ago Sunday, that saw the creation of the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. And there are members of Congress who are with us today who I remember in those critical moments in the legislative process who were absolutely indispensable. And I'd like you to join me in thanking Congressman Doug Lamborn for your great leadership on behalf of our Space Force. (Applause.) And the first person ever to mention to me that we ought to restart the National Space Council. Even before I had this job, he was one of the greatest champions of American leadership in space and the Congress of the United States: Congressman Brian Babin. Thank you. (Applause.) And I want to give particular note to a member of the United States Senate who, in the late going, was there fighting to ensure that we would establish a new branch of our Armed Forces that would have a foundation of independence to be able to grow for generations and serve the security of our nation. So join me in thanking Senator Kevin Cramer for your outstanding and seminal leadership. (Applause.) I also want to take a moment to express my appreciation to two members of Congress who are not here but who have been and remain champions and emblematic of the bipartisan support that this new branch of our Armed Forces enjoys across the Congress of the United States. Join me in thanking Congressman Adam Smith, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the incoming ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Mike Rogers , two leaders who have championed the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And it's my greatest honor to be here with so many warriors who have stood in the gap for America and to be able to thank you for your service, and to thank you for the foundation that you've helped pour for future generations of Americans in our security in space. There are several people to thank, but I , there's a man who I consider to be a giant in the realm of American leadership in space. He's a former commander of the Air Force Space Command. I first , I first met him at Offutt Air Force Base, when he was leading our Strategic Command forces there. He actually comes from a family that's been involved in American space enterprise throughout his life. And at just the right time, he became Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Would you join me in thanking General John Hyten and his wonderful wife Laura? (Applause.) I know the President knows is what I know , is we wouldn't be here without you, General. So thank you so very much for your strong leadership. But to all the members of our Armed Forces with us here today: Thank you for your service to our great nation. And thank you for your enthusiastic participation in this first year of the launch of the United States Space Force. You know, yesterday marked the birthday of flight. History records that it was 117 years ago that two sons of a Heartland preacher , one of whom was born in Indiana , (laughter) , did what for all of history had seemed impossible when they took their first flight to the skies over Kitty Hawk. But in just a few short days, on Sunday, December the 20th, we will mark the formal anniversary of another American breakthrough. On Sunday, it will be one year since President Donald Trump signed into law the first new branch of our Armed Forces in more than 70 years. That historic moment was a culmination of an effort that began from the early days of this administration , from almost the first moment that the President and I spoke about space when we were campaigning for these jobs. He had a dual focus of renewing American leadership in human space exploration, but also ensuring that America remained as dominant in space as we are in land and air and sea. And from the first day of this administration, President Trump called for steps to renew American leadership in space. It would be in June of 2018, the President first laid out a vision that called for the creation of a new military service focused solely on threats in and from space. The idea, though, and its conception was not a new one. For more than 50 years, Presidents and military leaders had discussed a branch of our military dedicated to ensuring American national security in and from space, but time and again, those efforts faltered. But I would submit to you that it is a tribute to the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, a tribute to the extraordinary military leadership gathered here today that this time, with bipartisan support, in just one and a half years, the United States Space Force was born. (Applause.) And since that historic moment, the United States Space Force has only grown stronger by the day. And that means that America has grown more secure by the day. After the Space Force became law, the President's first decision was who would lead it. And the President and I get the sense in the room, there is broad agreement that he got that decision right too. He chose a man , (applause) , He chose a man who , you've heard from these podiums already , is considered to be the Hap Arnold of our time. He would become the Chief of Space Operations of the United States Space Force. And I can tell you, having witnessed his leadership firsthand, that when General Jay Raymond stepped forward, it brought the leadership, the energy, the vision, the professionalism, and the patriotism necessary to have this historic year for the United States Space Force. So join me in thanking General Jay Raymond, his wonderful wife Mollie, and his proud son Gary for all of their commitment to America. (Applause.) Thank you, General. Good job. It's amazing to think that this spring General Raymond actually welcomed the first enlisted member to the Space Force. So how about a round of applause for Chief Master Sergeant Roger Towberman? (Applause.) You can stand up. Come on, stand up. Thank you. Thank you, Chief. In April, those two men were literally the entire United States Space Force. (Laughter.) But in just eight months, we already have more than 2,000 military members , space professionals in the United States Space Force. And I'm told that an additional 3,600 officers and enlisted airmen have already started to fill out the paperwork to transfer into the Space Force. (Applause.) In fact, General Raymond tells us that we anticipate, on our current trajectory, the Space Force will have nearly 6,000 space professionals serving all across the globe in just a short period of time. In fact, today, the Space Force got its newest and perhaps most famous member , a man who is actually in space right now, at the International Space Station. General Raymond took care of the paperwork, and I think it might actually be the first in-orbit transfer in military history. Colonel Michael Hopkins, NASA astronaut and member of the United States Space Force. (Applause.) Great move. You know, heroes like him and like all of you are going to inspire generations of Americans. In fact, Secretary Barbara Barrett and I witnessed some of those young Americans stepping forward in Colorado Springs, where we both had the opportunity to address the 62nd Graduation of the United States Air Force Academy. When I was there, they told me, in a typical year, about 20 cadets choose to go into space operations. This year, I was there when 86 cadets stood up and took the oath as officers in the United States Space Force. (Applause.) And just to continue to build on the momentum, I'm proud to report to the senator and these members of Congress and all those looking on that it was my honor , with Secretary Barrett at my side and General Raymond, as well , that we made it official. We traveled to Florida to announce the first two Space Force installations in American history: Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Patrick Space Force Base. (Applause.) And the Space Force is growing stronger every day and just in the nick of time. I think every one of the military leaders here knows that space is a vacuum, but we're not operating in a vacuum. The space race began in the 1950s, and it continues today. And in President Donald Trump, we have a Commander-in-Chief who has understood clearly that space is a warfighting domain and it's imperative that we invest the resources and the personnel and the technology to defend our nation and defend our values in the outer reaches of space. In fact, the United States, as you've heard already, faces emerging threats in space for countries like China and Russia, and those threats are only growing. We were reminded of that just this week, when Russia conducted yet another anti-satellite missile launch. We're leading in space, but our determination under this President and with his extraordinary military leadership, is to stay in the lead to defend America and defend our freedom from space. (Applause.) We seek peace through strength. And I want to say to the men and women of the United States Space Force: When it comes to the outer reaches of space, you are that strength. So today, we celebrate leadership from our President, the great bipartisan support in the Congress, and the military leadership that has seen to both the birth and the pouring of the first year's foundation of the United States Space Force. And I just came here today to thank each and every one of you, but also to make another announcement. As I mentioned, we just returned from the Oval Office. And so it is my honor, on behalf of the President of the United States, to announce that, henceforth, the men and women of the United States Space Force will be known as ""Guardians."" (Applause.) Soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Guardians will be defending our nation for generations to come. (Applause.) So, with that announcement, let me just say thank you again. I want to thank the members of Congress who are with us today. Thank you for the honor of your presence, but more importantly, thank you , thank you for your leadership in bringing us to this moment one year ago and the support that you've continued to provide to see to the launch of this new branch of our Armed Forces. But on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, let me urge each and every one of you Guardians to keep pushing. Keep pushing. Keep pushing the vision and the mission of the United States Space Force, which is to ensure that America remains as dominant in space, and from space, as we are on land and sea and air. And to each one of you Guardians, let me just say: Each and every day, from this day forward, I want to assure you that you will serve with the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief. You will serve with the confidence and gratitude of the American people. And I'm also convinced that those of you that will serve in the United States Space Force, in this generation and generations to come, will also go with the prayers of millions of Americans who will claim that ancient verse that promises that: If you rise on the wings of the dawn, if you settle on the far side of the sea, even if you go up to the heavens, that there His hand will guide you and his right hand will hold you fast. That then will be our prayer for our Guardians in this generation and for generations to come. So Happy Birthday to the United States Space Force. God bless our Guardians. God bless all the members of our Armed Forces. And God bless America. Semper Supra. (Applause.) END 5:00 P.M.

We join those around the country and the world who mourn this good and great man. Sheldon Adelson not only lived the American dream, he embodied it; a philanthropist whose generosity knew no bounds and helped shape countless worthy causes; and a businessman who changed an immeasurable number of lives. Sheldon Adelson believed deeply in America and in the importance of our historic alliance with the Jewish State of Israel. He championed the historic steps taken by our Administration to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, a move that will further solidify America's unbreakable bond with Israel for generations to come. When Abner fell, King David said, ""Do you not know that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?"" Sheldon Adelson was a leader and a great man, whose legacy will inspire generations for years to come, and he will be deeply missed by family, friends, and all of us who had the privilege to know this truly extraordinary American. To his beloved wife, Miriam, his children, and his 11 grandchildren: Karen and I extend our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy with a prayer. ""May G-d comfort you among the mourners for Zion and Jerusalem"" for his memory shall be a blessing for all time."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1493770/vice-president-pence-statement-on-the-passing-of-sheldon-adelson&speechType=6	Foreign Affairs			https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-statement-passing-sheldon-adelson/
