VSKH1712019128	Kamala Harris	2019-01-17	Senator Harris Statement on the Nomination of William Barr to be United States Attorney General	statement	Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) released the following statement opposing the nomination of William Barr to be Attorney General: The Attorney General is entrusted with ensuring the fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans. With the rule of law under daily attack from the President of the United States himself, that sacred trust is more important than ever. After two days of confirmation hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I do not believe that William Barr is the right person to hold this vital position at this critical time. With the government shut down over the President's demand for a border wall and asylum-seeking families detained at the border, Mr. Barr continues to support an ineffective and draconian approach to border security. With a criminal justice system that disproportionately harms communities of color, Mr. Barr continues to express support for the same failed policies he encouraged in the 1990s when he effectively advocated for mass incarceration. And with Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election at a critical moment, Mr. Barr refused to commit to recusing himself, even if career ethics officials at the Department of Justice recommended he do so. I appreciate the commitments Mr. Barr made, including a willingness to reconsider DOJ's attacks on Americans' health care coverage, to provide a list of consent decrees that have been withdrawn by DOJ and any consent decree he may withdraw, to respect state laws legalizing marijuana, and to vigorously enforce voting rights. I fully intend to hold him to these commitments should he become the Attorney General. While I respect Mr. Barr's past public service, I do not believe he will defend independent investigations from attacks, embrace a smart on crime approach to public safety, and ensure equal protection under the law for every single American.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1321726/senator-harris-statement-on-the-nomination-of-william-barr-to-be-united-states-attorney-general&speechType=6	Executive Branch Government Operations		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-statement-on-the-nomination-of-william-barr-to-be-united-states-attorney-general
VSKH522019127	Kamala Harris	2019-02-05	"Senator Harris Before State of the Union: ""The American People Are Spirited, Resourceful, and Resilient"""	statement	Tonight, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris delivered remarks in advance of President Trump's 2019 State of the Union address in which she rejected the president's attempts to drive Americans apart and instead offered a vision for the country based in speaking truth and recognizing that every American is united in service of a common, higher purpose. A full transcript of Senator Harris' remarks below, as prepared for delivery: Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in. So, listen , in war and peace, in times of hardship and prosperity, the State of the Union has always been a chance for our President to speak to the nation. It's a moment for a President to rise above politics and unite the country with a vision that includes ALL Americans, not just the ones who may have voted for them. It's a moment to bring us together and remind us that we should be united in service of a common purpose, a higher purpose. And I believe we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. It's a moment where we must answer a fundamental question. Who are we? What is the state of our union? What is that higher purpose we're called to? And how must our leaders respond? We need our leaders to speak the truth that we have an economy where the cost of health care, housing, and education are going up, but paychecks aren't growing fast enough to keep up. We also need our leaders to speak truth about the threat of climate change and about our broken criminal justice system, about our weakened position in the world and about the realities of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and transphobia. And we need our leaders to speak the biggest truth of all: In the face of powerful forces that have been trying to sow hate and division among us, the truth is that as Americans we have much more in common than what separates us. So let's speak those truths and recommit ourselves to fighting for our Union, an optimistic America. Let's fight for an America where the economy works for working people. An America where health care and education are fundamental rights, not a privilege for the wealthy few. Where our nation is secure, our democracy and its institutions are protected, and where we honor our service members and veterans. An America where no mother or father has to teach their son that people may stop him or kill him because of the color of his skin, and where no parent has to send their child to school with a bulletproof backpack. Let's fight for an America where we welcome refugees and immigrants, and where we fight for the dignity of all people, no matter who they are, no matter what they look like or how they identify. Now, if last year's remarks are any guide, we're in store not for a speech that will seek to draw us together as Americans, but one that seeks to score political points by driving us apart. We will hear insincere appeals to unity, but what we need is a policy agenda that calls on the better angels of our nature. So I want you all to listen closely. When you hear claims about how the economy is doing great, don't forget the working and middle-class families who are struggling, the teachers who are working two and three jobs, and the 800,000 federal workers who recently went 35 days without getting paid, all while this Administration gives away a trillion dollars to big corporations. When you hear claims about rewriting rules and cutting red tape, don't forget that means workers will have fewer workplace safety protections, pregnant women will have fewer clinics to turn to for care, children will have drinking water that's less safe. And remember that those rules are being rewritten to help big corporations and powerful interests. When you hear claims about how America is stronger in the world, don't forget the farmers and consumers hurt by this Administration's trade wars, and don't forget our allies who are now concerned that the United States of America may not keep our commitments. When you hear claims that our problems would all be solved if we just built a wall on our southern border, don't forget the babies ripped from their mothers' arms and the refugees fleeing violence and abuse who are being turned away. But no matter what we hear tonight, I want everyone to remember this. The strength of our union has never been found in the walls we build. It's in our diversity and our unity , and that is our power. We see the State of our Union in the working mom who's also working to earn her college degree We see it in the firefighter in California who works around the clock to battle a wildfire, knowing her own home is at risk of being demolished. We see it in the formerly incarcerated individual who re-enters society looking to contribute and in the Dreamer who pursues her future as a doctor in the face of fear and uncertainty that she'll be deported. We see it in the unpaid air traffic controller who still goes to work and helps safely land a plane and the neighbors who bring food to furloughed families. At this difficult moment, we can have faith that the American people are spirited, resourceful, and resilient. And because of them, we can come together around that common purpose. So thank you everyone. And after the speech, I hope that you'll all tune in to the official Democratic and Spanish-language responses from my friends Stacey Abrams and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1321729/senator-harris-before-state-of-the-union-the-american-people-are-spirited-resourceful-and-resilient&speechType=6	National Security Executive Branch Government Operations Trade Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-harris-before-state-of-the-union-the-american-people-are-spirited-resourceful-and-resilient
VSKH1322019126	Kamala Harris	2019-02-13	Harris Applauds Senate Passage of Bill to Strengthen Partnerships Between HBCUs and Federal Agencies	statement	"Yesterday, the U.S. Senate passed the HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students (HBCU PARTNERS) Act, bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) to strengthen partnerships between federal agencies and the country's more than 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by requiring federal agencies with relevant grants and programs to undertake annual planning and coordinate their efforts to support and expand HBCU participation those programs. ""Our nation's HBCUs are absolutely essential to preparing Black students for the jobs and challenges of the 21st century, and we must ensure that they have the resources they need to continue that mission,"" said Harris. ""I'm thrilled that the United States Senate has passed this legislation to ensure the federal government is working hand in hand with HBCUs to keep them strong."" The HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students (HBCU PARTNERS) Act also strengthens the rigor and transparency requirements of existing law by requiring that agencies track their progress toward past goals and share their plans with Congress. In addition, it codifies the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, ensuring an ongoing avenue for the institutions' priorities and policy concerns to be raised. Yesterday, the U.S. Senate also passed Senator Harris' bipartisan bill to reauthorize the HBCU Historic Preservation Program, which would authorize funding for grants to restore historic buildings and sites on HBCU campuses that have deteriorated over time. Many buildings and sites at HBCU campuses across the country are over 100 years old and are at risk of being permanently lost if they are not preserved and protected. In addition to Senator Harris, the HBCU PARTNERS Act is co-sponsored U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Tim Scott (R-SC), Doug Jones (D-AL), David Perdue (R-GA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Mike Braun (R-IN).

I am disappointed that the administration has walked away from negotiations with California over how best to preserve current fuel economy and emissions standards.

VSKH2822019122	Kamala Harris	2019-02-28	Harris Reintroduces Legislation to Protect Civil Rights of All Americans	statement	"Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris reintroduced the Do No Harm Act, legislation to amend the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to ensure that the law can no longer be invoked to threaten fundamental civil and legal rights. Since its 1993 inception, RFRA has been used to discriminate against and harm others, including LGBTQ individuals, women, and children. Companion legislation will also be reintroduced today in the House by Representatives Joe Kennedy (D-MA) and Bobby Scott (D-VA). ""The freedom to worship is one of our nation's most fundamental rights. That First Amendment guarantee should never be used to undermine other Americans' civil rights or subject them to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity,"" said Harris. ""I'm proud to reintroduce the Do No Harm Act to more comprehensively protect the basic rights of every American."" In 1993, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in response to a Supreme Court case undermining the rights of religious minorities. But since its passage, twenty-one states have passed state RFRAs, and the laws have been used to defend employment discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, deny health care coverage for employees, claim exemptions to civil rights law, and complicate justice in child labor and abuse cases. The Do No Harm Act would prevent the RFRA law from being used to deny: Protection against discrimination laws or the promotion of equal opportunity, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws;Workplace protections or protections against child abuse;Healthcare access, information, referrals, provisions, coverage or services to which persons are otherwise legally entitled;Services that the government has contracted to be provided to beneficiaries through a government contract, grant, or cooperative agreement; andAccommodations or other benefits and services provided by the government. In addition to Harris, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to reintroduce the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act. The legislation would protect the health and safety of pregnant women and youth by reinstituting the presumption of release of pregnant women and youth in immigration detention, further prohibiting the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from shackling pregnant women in its custody, and setting new standards of care and transparency for the treatment of pregnant women and youth. The bill was first introduced last summer in light of reports of mistreatment of pregnant women in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, and was reintroduced on the heels of a recent Washington Post report about a women in ICE custody whose pregnancy ended in a stillbirth after she went into labor prematurely. ""Detaining pregnant women in poor conditions doesn't make our country safer, it's cruel and immoral,"" said Harris. ""I am committed to ensuring that children and pregnant mothers at the border receive proper medical care and will continue to fight for their human rights."" Along with Senator Harris, the legislation is cosponsored by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), Senator Tom Carper (D-DE), Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), Senator Chris Coons (D-DE), Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT), Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Senator Tina Smith (D-MN), Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR).

VSKH732019120	Kamala Harris	2019-03-07	Harris, Clarke Reintroduce Legislation to Commission Statue Honoring U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm	statement	"Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) reintroduced a bill directing Congress to commission a statue of former U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm to be displayed in the United States Capitol. Currently, there are four statues and busts in the United State Capitol representing African-Americans, including Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Sojourner Truth. Companion legislation will also be introduced today in the House of Representatives by Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-NY). ""For the first time in history, there are more than 20 Black women serving in the United State Congress, and we all stand on the shoulders of Shirley Chisholm,"" said Senator Harris. ""Shirley's legacy inspires us to continue our fight to give a voice to the voiceless and pursue justice and equality for every American. Her legacy deserves to stand tall in the United States Capitol."" ""Shirley Chisholm used the authority of her experience to create nutrition assistance programs, expand health care services for parents and children, increase the minimum wage, support the veterans of our Armed Forces, and provide opportunities for women in college, graduate school, and collegiate and professional sports with the enactment of Title IX,"" said Congresswoman Clarke. ""For this and countless other reasons, Congress should honor Chisholm's life and living legacy and her contribution to advancing civil and human rights by among other defining figures in our nation's history.""

VSKH1232019119	Kamala Harris	2019-03-12	Harris Legislation Signed into Law as Part of Public Lands Package	statement	"Today, two pieces of legislation authored by U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) were signed into law as part of the Natural Resources Management Act, as well as a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The LWCF supports projects across California that preserve the state's wildlife, protect Californians' access to clean air and clean water, and fuel California's $92 billion outdoor recreation economy, the largest in the nation. ""I'm thrilled that my legislation to preserve historic HBCU buildings and to establish a memorial to the lives lost in the 1928 St. Francis Dam disaster have been signed into law along with a permanent reauthorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund,"" said Harris.

Senator Harris' bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) Historic Preservation Program for fiscal years 2019 to 2025 was included into the lands package and signed into law. Across more than 100 HBCUs around the country, historic buildings and sites, some more than 100 years old, have deteriorated over time and are at risk of being permanently lost if they are not preserved and protected. Senator Harris' legislation will authorize funding for grants to restore these historic buildings and sites, as well as improve accessibility on many HBCU campuses. Also included in the package and signed into law was another Harris-led bill, the St. Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial Act, which will establish a national memorial to honor the over 400 Californians lost in the 1928 St. Francis Dam disaster, which occurred 91 years ago today.

VSKH1332019118	Kamala Harris	2019-03-13	Harris Joins Colleagues to Introduce Bill to Expand Social Security	statement	"Today, U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) joined her colleagues to introduce legislation to expand Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. The legislation would increase benefits by about $1,342 a year for seniors now making less than $16,000 annually and increase cost-of-living adjustments by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. ""In the richest nation in the world, it is a travesty that so many Americans are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,"" said Harris. ""Over the past two years, this administration has been more focused on cutting taxes for the top one percent than making sure families can make ends meet. We need to expand Social Security and provide our seniors and other beneficiaries of this vital program with greater dignity and peace of mind."" Social Security is one of the most popular and successful government programs. Before Social Security was created in 1935, about half of America's seniors were living in poverty. Today the senior poverty rate is just 8.8 percent. Yet, despite this success, one out of every five seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $13,500 a year and about half of Americans 55 and older have zero retirement savings. The bill would ensure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 52 years, according to the retirement system's chief actuary. It would extend the program's solvency by making the wealthiest 1.8 percent of Americans , those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year , pay the same rate into the retirement system as everyone else already pays. Current law caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $132,900.

VSKH1332019117	Kamala Harris	2019-03-13	Senator Kamala Harris on California Death Penalty Moratorium	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) released the following statement today on California Governor Gavin Newsom's announcement of a moratorium on the state's death penalty. Harris has opposed the death penalty throughout her career in law enforcement: ""This is an important day for justice and for the state of California. I applaud Governor Newsom for his decision to place a moratorium on the death penalty. As a career law enforcement official, I have opposed the death penalty because it is immoral, discriminatory, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. ""The symbol of our justice system is a woman with a blindfold. It is supposed to treat all equally, but the application of the death penalty - a final and irreversible punishment - has been proven to be unequally applied. Black and Latino defendants are far more likely to be executed than their white counterparts. Poor defendants without a team of lawyers are far more likely to enter death row than those with strong representation. Your race or your bank account shouldn't determine your sentence. ""It is also a waste of taxpayer money. The California Legislative Analyst's office estimates that California would save $150 million a year if it replaced the death penalty with a sentence of life without parole. That's money that could go into schools, health care, or restorative justice programs. It is not a smart way to keep people safe. ""I believe if evidence proves one human being murdered another human being, there should be swift and severe punishment. But the death penalty in America has been imposed as a final punishment to many who were later found to be innocent. Between 1973 and 2016, for every ten people executed, more than one person has been exonerated. Killing one innocent person would be too many. It's time to turn the page on this chapter and end a deeply flawed system of capital punishment in California."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1330847/senator-kamala-harris-on-california-death-penalty-moratorium&speechType=6	Death Penalty		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-kamala-harris-on-california-death-penalty-moratorium

The Digital Service Act will help harness top talent for the government, save taxpayer dollars, and put the power of technology to work on behalf of the American people."" The Digital Service Act would: Authorize $50 million annually for the United States Digital Service.Authorize $15 million annually for state and local governments to receive two year seed grants to establish and strengthen digital services.Require at least 50% of each grant to be used for talent rather than technology.Require grantees to report on outcomes before the end of the two-year period.Require the USDS to report to Congress on the impact of grants bi-annually.Supporters of the Digital Service Act include Code for America and the Center for Democracy and Technology. ""For too long, we have neglected the machinery of government. The Digital Service Act represents an opportunity to help government move fully into the digital age , to get better outcomes that cost less and, ultimately, rebuild faith and trust in our public institutions. The Digital Service Act would be an important step towards making government truly work for all Americans,"" said Jennifer Pahlka, Executive Director of Code for America and former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer. ""The Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT) is proud to support the Digital Service Act introduced by Senator Harris. It captures the spirit of American technological innovation together with the tested service delivery model of the United States Digital Service (USDS) in order to bring transformative solutions to the state and local level. Modeled after the USDS and its successful efforts to revamp how veterans and Medicare recipients engage with federal agencies, the bill provides cost-sharing grants to state and local governments to build teams of technologists, engineers, designers, and civil service workers to overcome a specific challenge with a focused digital solution,"" said Chris Calabrese, Vice President for Policy at CDT.

VSKH1532019113	Kamala Harris	2019-03-15	Harris, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Support Military Families by Fixing Inconsistency in GI Bill Benefit	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), along with 12 of their colleagues, in introducing the GI Education Benefits Fairness Act, legislation that would support veterans' families by extending Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits to foster children and legal wards. ""Members of the military make sacrifices every day for our nation, and we should do everything we can to support them and their families,"" said Harris. ""This legislation would make a common-sense fix to the Post/911 GI Bill to ensure that veterans and their families are receiving the education benefits they deserve."" The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides education benefits to veterans and service members. It also allows active duty troops to transfer their unused education benefits to a spouse or child. Under current law, while the Department of Defense (DOD) includes wards and foster children in the definition of an eligible child, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not. This has led to a bureaucratic nightmare for some members of the armed services and their families. The GI Education Benefits Fairness Act would amend the definition of an ""eligible child"" for the purposes of transferability of benefits under the Post 9/11 Educational Assistance Program to include the DOD definition of a child , which includes wards and foster children. Doing so would allow foster children and wards to receive the education funding they deserve, including providing retroactive pay for those foster children and wards who were previously approved for GI education benefits only to have them revoked. Along with Harris, Durbin, and Duckworth, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Gary Peters (D-MI), Doug Jones (D-AL), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

""California's service members and their families make sacrifices every day, and their housing should be clean and free from health hazards,"" said Sen. Harris. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues to introduce this common-sense amendment to ensure our nation's military families live in the safe and comfortable housing that they deserve."" The proposed amendment would reaffirm a commitment by Congress to address pervasive allegations of health hazards at privatized military housing under the budget resolution. The health hazard allegations include mold blooms, lead poisoning, cockroaches, rodent infestations, and water leaks. In February, Senators Harris, Warner, and Kaine introduced the Ensuring Safe Housing for our Military Act, which would create stronger oversight mechanisms over private military housing, allow the military to withhold payments to contractors until issues are resolved, and prohibit contractors from charging certain fees. It would also require the military to withhold incentive fees to poorly performing contractors.

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday reintroduced the Rent Relief Act, legislation to provide much-needed support to middle class and working Americans who are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of rent. The legislation creates a new, refundable tax credit for households whose housing costs exceed 30% of their income, including rent and utilities. Unlike existing tax credits, Americans who qualify would receive the benefits every month. Harris was joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Maggie Hassan (D-NH) in reintroducing the legislation. ""Housing is a human right, and we must act now to end the affordable housing crisis and provide relief to working families who are worried about making each month's rent,"" said Harris. ""Right now, nearly half of Americans couldn't afford an emergency $400 expense , these families need help now. This is about more than just economics, it's about the basic security and dignity that every American deserves to have in their own home."" Under the Rent Relief Act, a household's credit would be determined by their income and the amount spent on housing costs (rent, utilities) in excess of 30% of their gross income. According to the Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the Rent Relief Act, which was first introduced in 2018, would reduce the poverty rate by as much as 2.4%, lifting 7.8 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 2 million children. Approximately 21 million Americans spend more than 30% of their earnings on rent, with a disproportionate and rising burden falling on families of color. Companion legislation will be introduced in the House by Representatives Danny K. Davis (D-IL), Jimmy Gomez (D-CA), and Scott Peters (D-CA). Supporters of the Rent Relief Act include the National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Alliance to End Homelessness, Fair Housing of California, and the National Housing Law Project. ""I applaud Senator Harris and Congressmembers Danny Davis, Scott Peters, and Jimmy Gomez for their leadership in introducing this innovative, bold proposal, which would help struggling families who today face impossible choices between paying rent and meeting their other basic needs, including putting groceries on the table and taking care of their health. A new tax credit for renters - like the one proposed today - could transform lives, providing millions of the lowest income people with the breadth of opportunities that start with an affordable home, opportunities to climb the economic ladder, improve their health, and allow children to do better in school."" , Diane Yentel, President and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1338297/harris-reintroduces-legislation-to-provide-relief-to-americans-facing-skyrocketing-cost-of-rent&speechType=6	Housing and Property		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-reintroduces-legislation-to-provide-relief-to-americans-facing-skyrocketing-cost-of-rent

In September 2017, the president announced that the cap for fiscal year 2018 refugee admissions would be set at a record-low 45,000, down from 110,000 in the previous year.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and 13 Democratic colleagues to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019 to guarantee health care at far lower cost to working families and the nation as a whole. ""Health care should be a right for everyone in this country, not a privilege for the few. No family should be forced to go into debt to pay for the medical treatment of a loved one or the prescription drugs they need to stay healthy,"" said Harris. ""Medicare is the most popular health plan in the country because it works. Medicare for All finally makes sure every American has affordable, comprehensive health care."" The Medicare for All Act of 2019 would ensure that Americans could go to the doctor of their choice and get the care they need, when they need it, without going into debt. It would significantly lower the price of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical corporations. Furthermore, it would expand coverage to include home and community based long-term care services, ensuring people with disabilities can receive the care they need to stay in their homes and remain part of their communities. While the United States spends more per capita on health care than any other nation, it remains the case that approximately 30 million Americans do not have health insurance, thousands of people die each year because they cannot afford medical care, and nearly half of Americans fear bankruptcy in the event of a health emergency.

Courtney Phillips, in her official capacity as Executive Commissioner of HHSC, et al. Planned Parenthood is challenging Texas' attempt to exclude the health provider's affiliates from the Medicaid program. ""Congress enacted the free-choice-of-provider provision in the Medicaid Act because it intended to confer a fundamental individual right on Medicaid-eligible patients: ""the choice of one's own doctor and other provider of health services,"" the senators wrote in the brief. ""This right, which Congress intended to ""be enjoyed by all Americans,' would be hollow without the corresponding ability to vindicate that right through a private enforcement action."" In 2016, Texas revoked Planned Parenthood's status as a qualified medical provider for Texans on Medicaid. The move was blocked by a federal judge in 2018, but last month the Fifth Circuit overturned the judge's ruling and lifted the injunction. Planned Parenthood appealed the decision, and the case will soon be reheard by the entire Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals en banc, this time focusing on whether Medicaid patients can sue to enforce their rights under the Medicaid Act. ""The plain text of the free-choice-of-provider provision and its legislative history manifest the clear intent of Congress not only to confer the right to choose a qualified medical provider on individual patients, but also to permit them to challenge in court State Medicaid plans that infringe upon that right,"" they continued.

The DEFEND Act would: Increase available punitive damages available to victims under the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) from two times the amount of damages awarded to three times the amount of damages awarded. This increase in available damages improves the deterrent effect of the EEA while ensuring that victims of trade theft are properly compensated for their injuries.Extend the statute of limitations for civil actions from 3 to 5 years after the ""misappropriation"" was discovered or should have been discovered.Expand the extraterritorial scope of the EEA to include offenses occurring abroad that have ""substantial economic effect"" in the United States, ensuring that victims can still be made whole if an offense causes significant economic harm but does not occur on United States soil.""The move to expand extraterritorial scope is a critical step to align the law with how foreign threat actors target U.S. organizations. We have observed adversary groups stealing sensitive business information from a foreign partners, subsidiaries, suppliers, and customers of many U.S. companies. From a victim organization's perspective, the threat to their business is still the same as if those threats occurred in the territorial United States, but under current law, they are not provided appropriate protection. This bill would help ensure legal mechanisms are available worldwide for U.S. companies targeted by state-backed groups who might otherwise operate without risk or repercussion,"" said Christopher Porter, CTO for Global Cybersecurity Policy, FireEye, Inc. ""The DEFEND Act would represent a vital step towards ensuring that American companies doing business abroad, or whose trade secrets are misappropriated abroad, will have better options in U.S. courts to redress misappropriation committed on foreign soil. Expanding the extraterritorial scope of the law would provide U.S. businesses with necessary legal mechanisms to counter the threat of trade secret theft, and I applaud Senator Harris for her leadership on this issue,"" said Professor Elizabeth Rowe, University of Florida Levin College of Law ""Senator Harris has a long history of wrestling with the challenges prosecutors face in dealing with cybercriminals. Her DEFEND Act clarifies a critical gap in our nation's ability to bring cybercriminals to justice. All too often, cybercriminals abroad operate with a sense of impunity because they think they are beyond the reach of the law. American victims of cybercrime have little hope that their attackers will ever see a courtroom. This legislation is intended to allow the government more time to find and indict those who steal our nations' intellectual property, increase the penalties that they would face for these crimes, and allow the government to bring charges even when the perpetrator does not enter the U.S. With this act, the long arm of the law gets even longer,"" said Mieke Eoyang, Vice President for the National Security Program, Third Way"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1350529/harris-reintroduces-bill-to-combat-economic-espionage&speechType=6	Foreign Affairs Economy and Fiscal		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-reintroduces-bill-to-combat-economic-espionage
VSKH146201998	Kamala Harris	2019-06-14	Harris, Colleagues Introduce Bicameral Bill to Preserve and Expand Access to Naturalization	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris joined Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and 5 of their colleagues in introducing the Citizenship Affordability Act, legislation to preserve and expand access to citizenship by ensuring legal residents who are eligible for naturalization, but struggling to afford its cost, can access waivers to reduce or eliminate fees associated with the process. ""We are and have always been a nation of immigrants, and we should do all we can to provide a pathway to citizenship for those who have come here in search of a better life,"" said Senator Harris. ""I'm proud to co-sponsor this legislation that will ensure that the cost of the naturalization process is not a barrier to becoming a full and active participant in our civic life. Our diversity is our strength, and we must foster it."" Currently, aspiring American citizens eligible for naturalization are required to pay USCIS an application fee of $640 plus $85 biometric fee for a total of $725 per applicant. Those expenses can quickly snowball if people must pay for lawyers, English classes, and civics test preparation. If several family members are applying, costs multiply. Legal residents who earn less than 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level can apply for a full fee waiver and a reduced fee for those earning less than 200 percent. The fee waivers do not apply to those making between 200 and 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, many of whom still struggle to afford the fees associated with naturalization. USCIS is proposing changing the eligibility requirements for fee waivers and limit access to the naturalization fee waiver. This legislation would preserve and expand who is eligible for a fee waiver and ensure citizenship is affordable to all who are legally eligible to apply. The Citizenship Affordability Act is supported by national and local organizations such as NALEO, UnidosUS, National Partnership for New Americans, Church World Service, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), American Friends Service Committee NJ, HIAS Pennsylvania, Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, Refugee Women's Alliance (Seattle, WA), Sunflower Community Action, Kansas People's Action, Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, Nebraska Appleseed, Promise Arizona and Dream Big Nevada. The Citizenship Affordability Act would: Make permanent full and partial income-based Naturalization Fee Waivers.Codify the full fee waiver for naturalization fees for: filing to preserve residence for naturalization purposes; filing an application for certificate of citizenship; filing an application for a replacement naturalization or citizenship document; the filing of an application for citizenship and issuance of certificate under section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and biometrics capture and background checks.Codify and raise to 250 percent of the federal poverty level the partial fee waiver for the same fees.Require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the receipt of means-tested benefits as evidence of eligibility for the fee waivers.Joining Senators Harris and Menendez on this bill are Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI)."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1350520/harris-colleagues-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-preserve-and-expand-access-to-naturalization&speechType=6	Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-bicameral-bill-to-preserve-and-expand-access-to-naturalization
VSKH196201997	Kamala Harris	2019-06-19	Harris Introduces 21st Century SKILLS Act to Invest in Workforce Training	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday introduced the 21st Century Skills are Key to Individuals' Life-Long Success (SKILLS) Act, legislation to make high-quality training, education, and supportive services more accessible for workers to help them secure 21st century jobs. As offshoring, automation, artificial intelligence, and other technological advances fundamentally change the future of work in our country, American workers face unprecedented challenges in obtaining the skills required to remain competitive in the global economy. Already, 52% of unemployed Americans believe they need more education or training for the jobs they want, but only 26% took a class or pursued additional training to acquire those skills. Too often, workers are either unaware of training opportunities or unable to afford the costs associated with developing new skills. ""Today's economy is rapidly changing and will require many workers to build on their existing skills or obtain new skills throughout the course of their careers,"" said Sen. Harris. ""It is critical that Congress and employers recognize the importance of workforce development in order for our country to remain competitive in the global economy. This legislation makes a serious investment in our workers by removing barriers to securing the good-paying jobs of today and the future , including covering the costs of high-quality training and education programs and critical supports, such as child care, transportation, and books."" The 21st Century SKILLS Act will: Establish accounts for American workers to access skills training and other educational opportunities, as well as pay costs associated with pursuing that opportunity, such as child care and transportation costs. Up to 78 million Americans will be eligible for:$8,000 if they are unemployed, dislocated, or employed and earning under 50% of state median income.$6,000 if they are employed and earning 50-75% of state median income.$4,000 if they are employed and earning 75-100% of state median income.Increase transparency and accountability in the workforce development system to ensure workers maintain access to high-quality, high-value training opportunities.Require states to set minimum levels of performance for training providers to remain eligible for training account funds.Create tools to compare employment outcome data across programs, providers, and states.Establish a grant program to encourage employers, education and training providers, labor, local workforce boards, and community-based organizations to collaborate to identify a community's needs and align training and education opportunities with local employment demand."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354957/harris-introduces-21st-century-skills-act-to-invest-in-workforce-training&speechType=6	Employment and Affirmative Action		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-21st-century-skills-act-to-invest-in-workforce-training
VSKH206201996	Kamala Harris	2019-06-20	Harris Introduces Bill to Dramatically Expand Access to PrEP	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday introduced the PrEP Access and Coverage Act, legislation to dramatically expand Americans' access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medication that when taken daily reduces the risk of HIV infection by up to 92%. HIV disproportionately impacts gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and, in particular, people of color. Members of communities at the intersections of these groups are most heavily impacted. A generic form of PrEP is expected to enter the market in 2020, but the high cost of the medication, combined with out-of-pocket costs for follow-up visits and lab testing, places barriers between PrEP and the more than 1 million people who would most benefit from it. ""PrEP is a critical advancement in the fight against HIV that can finally provide peace of mind to Americans who live in the shadow of the HIV epidemic. But for too many in our country, lack of insurance coverage and steep costs have put PrEP out of reach, and that needs to change,"" said Harris. ""We must truly commit ourselves to HIV prevention by finally requiring every health insurance plan, public and private, to cover PrEP and all of the required tests and follow-up doctors' visits. We must also provide the resources necessary to help people without insurance access PrEP. Nearly four decades since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS crisis that took so many lives and caused countless others to live in fear, we can and will stop the spread of this disease."" On June 11, 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gave PrEP an ""A"" rating as a preventive service. This rating means that private insurance companies will have to cover PrEP without cost-sharing for those individuals by 2021. Harris' legislation goes further by requiring that all private and public insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, cover without a copay not only the drug itself but also all associated doctors' visits, tests, and monitoring recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354947/harris-introduces-bill-to-dramatically-expand-access-to-prep&speechType=6	Health Insurance		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-bill-to-dramatically-expand-access-to-prep
VSKH216201995	Kamala Harris	2019-06-21	Harris, Whitehouse, Blumenthal Introduce Bill to Protect Independence of Justice Department	statement	"U.S. Senators Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) on Thursday introduced the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act, legislation to increase transparency in the relationship between the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House and prevent political interference in law enforcement decisions. The bill would impose important reporting requirements for contacts between the Justice Department and White House pertaining to specific cases or investigations. In May, Harris questioned Attorney General William Barr before the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether the president or anyone in the White House had directed him to open an investigation into any individual. Barr refused to answer. ""The administration of justice should be blind, not driven by politics. But the President's attempts to derail the Mueller investigation, paired with Attorney General Barr's refusal to give clear answers to Congress, have raised serious concerns about DOJ's independence,"" said Harris. ""The honor system isn't enough anymore , we need a law. I'm proud to work with Senators Whitehouse and Blumenthal to create transparency and give Congress important oversight tools to help restore the American people's trust in the Department of Justice."" The Justice Department has historically enjoyed a measure of independence from political interference in order to ensure even-handed administration of the laws. While presidents and White House officials may properly engage with the Department on broad policy questions, it threatens the equal and just administration of law when the White House seeks to influence Department decision-making on individual law enforcement matters. When this important norm has been violated, presidents have received heavy criticism. Although both the Department and the White House have long maintained policies that define and prohibit such inappropriate contacts, these policies lack the force of law and can be violated without remedy. As a result, presidential administrations have continued to violate this norm. Under President Trump, the principle of Department independence has further deteriorated, demonstrating clearly that the current contacts policies are not effective. Indeed, public reporting has revealed numerous contacts between White House and Department officials that, on their face, violate the contacts policies. The Security from Political Interference in Justice Act would help to ensure the Justice Department's independence by increasing transparency and accountability in the relationship between the White House and the Department. The bill would require that: Both the White House and Justice Department log all communications between White House and Justice officials and staff pertaining to specific cases or investigations that DOJ might undertake. The log would include (1) the names of participants in the communication, (2) the topics of the communications, and (3) a statement describing the purpose and necessity of the communication.The logs be disclosed every six months to Congress and to the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department. It directs Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility to review the logs and to notify Congress if any of the logged communications are inappropriate from a law enforcement perspective or raise concerns about improper political interference. The bill exempts certain top-level contacts from disclosure to Congress, but requires those contacts to be logged, shared with the Inspector General's office and the Office of Professional Responsibility, and disclosed in response to a Congressional subpoena. Both the logging and disclosure requirements would remain in place irrespective of the White House and/or Department's internal contacts policies."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354941/harris-whitehouse-blumenthal-introduce-bill-to-protect-independence-of-justice-department&speechType=6	Executive Branch Government Operations		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-whitehouse-blumenthal-introduce-bill-to-protect-independence-of-justice-department

Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) joined Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and 23 of their colleagues in reintroducing the Restore Honor to Service Members Act. The legislation will correct the military records of service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. ""All of our nation's service members are entitled to the honor and benefits they earn, regardless of who they are or who they love,"" said Senator Harris. ""I'm proud to co-sponsor the Restore Honor to Service Members Act. These brave men and women have sacrificed so much for our country and Congress should fix the mistakes of the past."" Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of ""other than honorable,"" ""general discharge"" or ""dishonorable,"" depending on the circumstances. As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status. The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment. Many veterans who were affected by discriminatory policies such as Don't Ask, Don't Tell do not know that they can have their records corrected or initiate a review. This legislation would require the Department of Defense to reach out to veterans who faced discrimination because of their sexual orientation about the Department's process for correcting their records."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354922/harris-feinstein-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-honor-to-service-members-discharged-due-to-sexual-orientation&speechType=6	Military Personnel Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-feinstein-colleagues-reintroduce-legislation-to-restore-honor-to-service-members-discharged-due-to-sexual-orientation

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and 33 of their colleagues in introducing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2019, legislation that will guarantee the right of public employees to organize, act concertedly, and bargain collectively in states that currently do not afford these basic protections. There are nearly 17.3 million public workers across the country. Unlike private sector workers, there is no federal law protecting the freedom of public sector workers to join a union and collectively bargain for fair wages, benefits, and improved working conditions. ""When workers have the ability to organize and collectively bargain, we're all better off,"" Senator Harris said. ""We have unions to thank for the five-day work week, eight-hour work day, and so much more. Today, as the Supreme Court chips away at the rights of public sector unions, we must take action to reaffirm union rights and ensure that public employees maintain their hard-fought protections and keep the ability to bargain for higher wages and better benefits."" The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act of 2019 provides the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) with the authority to determine whether a state, territory, or locality provides public employees and supervisors the right: To form, join, or assist a union, to bargain collectively, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid (including the filing of joint, class or collective legal claims) or protection;To have their union recognized by their public employer if the union is freely chosen by a majority of employees, to bargain with the employer through the union, and to commit their collective-bargaining agreement to writing;To be free from forced recertification elections of their already-recognized representative and decertification of their chosen representative within one year of an election or the expiration of a valid collective bargaining agreement;To have a procedure for resolving impasses in collective bargaining culminating in binding arbitration; andTo authorize employers to deduct fees to the union from their payroll when employees consent.The FLRA approach gives states wide flexibility to write and administer their own labor laws provided they meet this minimum standard. If a state substantially provides for the rights and procedures laid out in the bill, that state is unaffected by this bill. States that do not provide for these rights or only partially provide for these rights, however, will be compelled to meet these basic labor standards. The FLRA must issue regulations within one year of the bill becoming law and they can enforce the law through federal court. The bill also creates a private right of action to enforce compliance in federal court but only if the FLRA has not yet filed suit seeking relief for the same issue."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1354924/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen-rights-of-public-sector-workers-to-join-unions-bargain-collectively&speechType=6	Employment and Affirmative Action Labor Unions		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-strengthen-rights-of-public-sector-workers-to-join-unions-bargain-collectively

Harris joined Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and 14 of their colleagues in introducing legislation to block immigration enforcement actions at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and religious institutions without prior approval and exigent circumstances. The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act codifies the Department of Homeland Security's existing policies and expands on those policies to ensure that immigrants are able to access education, criminal justice, and social services without fear of deportation. ""The president and his administration have spent years demonizing immigrants and stoking fear in immigrant communities , that must end,"" said Senator Harris. ""The priority of law enforcement officers should be promoting the safety of the communities they protect, not rounding up immigrants at schools, hospitals, and places of worship. A victim of a crime should be able to run into the street and flag down a police officer instead of being made to feel like the criminal. We must take action to keep our communities safe for everyone."" Along with Harris and Blumenthal, this legislation is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Edward J.

The bill is also supported by more than 300 national, state, and local organizations. The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act requires that, except in special circumstances, ICE agents receive prior approval from a supervisor when there are exigent circumstances before engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations, such as: schools, hospitals and health clinics, places of worship, organizations assisting crime victims, and organizations that provide services to children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or individuals with mental or physical disabilities. The legislation also requires that ICE agents receive annual training and report annually regarding enforcement actions in these locations. This bill codifies and expands upon rules already in place at ICE, which would provide policy consistency across enforcement agencies and administrations over time, giving immigrant communities certainty that their rights will be respected."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1358237/harris-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-block-immigration-raids-at-schools-hospitals-courthouses-and-churches&speechType=6	Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-block-immigration-raids-at-schools-hospitals-courthouses-and-churches

Co-sponsors of the BASIC Act include U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, more than 30% of college students may face food insecurity. At HBCUs in particular, students often live in food deserts where they lack convenient access to grocery stores or restaurants. This issue is particularly pronounced among community college students: a recent survey by the HOPE Center found that two-thirds of community college students are food insecure and half are housing insecure, including 14 percent who have experienced homelessness. Students and institutions alike have been grappling with how the cost of basic necessities presents significant barriers to student welfare and academic success. ""No student, no matter their circumstances, should have to worry about going hungry or keeping a roof over their head,"" said Harris. ""We cannot accept a status quo in which young people seeking a higher education are unable to afford life's necessities. I'm proud to introduce the BASIC Act to make sure every college student can focus on learning above all else."" The BASIC Act would: Establish a $500 million competitive grant program to help institutions of higher education identify and meet the basic needs of students, including food, housing, transportation, child care, health care, and technology.Require at least 25% of grants to go to community colleges. Grant priority will also go to institutions with 25% or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, and other minority-serving institutions.Requires the Department of Education to coordinate with the Departments of Agriculture, Housing & Urban Development, and Health & Human Services to develop and implement an agreement to: Securely share data to identify current students who may be eligible for federal means-tested programs, including SNAP, SSI, TANF, WIC, Medicaid, and federal housing assistance; andCoordinate efforts to help institutions of higher education enroll eligible students in these programs."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1361683/harris-introduces-basic-act-to-help-college-students-afford-basic-needs&speechType=6	Higher Education		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-basic-act-to-help-college-students-afford-basic-needs

More broadly, we can't forget that the Russians undertook social media operations designed to take advantage of and deepen our nation's internal divisions, particularly on the issue of race.

""We must take steps to affirm the basic human dignity of those who come to our country seeking a better life, and that starts with ensuring legal representation to those who cross the border and fixing the inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers."" The Access to Counsel Act would ensure that individuals held or detained while attempting to enter the United States, whether at a border crossing or a port of entry, are guaranteed access to legal counsel. Originally introduced in 2017, the Access to Counsel Act was the first bill Harris introduced as a United States senator. Specifically, the Access to Counsel Act would: Affirm that the right to access to counsel attaches at the time of holding or detention.Provide a redress option if counsel cannot personally meet with detained individuals requiring provision of legal advice remotely (e.g., phone or Video Teleconference).Invalidate any effort by immigration enforcement officials to persuade someone to relinquish their legal status (by executing a Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status or Withdrawal of Application for Admission) if that person has been denied access to counsel.Direct that immigration enforcement officials shall limit detention to the briefest term possible and least restrictive conditions practicable, and will include access to food, water, and restroom facilities.Supporters of the legislation include UnidosUS, Amnesty International, Women's Refugee Commission, Human Rights Watch, Church World Services, CHIRLA, United We Dream, AILA, National Immigration Law Center, International Refugee Assistance Project, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Columbia Law School Immigrants' Rights Clinic, HIAS, National Center for Transgender Equality, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, National Education Association, Friends Committee on National Legislation, MomsRising, J Street, The Latin America Working Group, Indivisible, The Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, RAICES Texas, KIND, The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, WOLA, OneJustice, Arab American Institute Foundation, Center Global (a program of the DC Center for the LGBT Community), and South Asian Americans Leading Together. In addition to Harris, co-sponsors of the Access to Counsel Act include Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Markey (D-MA), Warren (D-MA), Merkley (D-OR), Gillibrand (D-NY), and Booker (D-NJ). The DONE Act would place a moratorium on further expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers by halting funds for construction or expansion of new facilities and increase visibility into conditions at existing facilities. Since Harris originally introduced this legislation in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General has found egregious violations of detention standards at four ICE detention facilities, including nooses in detainee cells, expired food, dilapidated and moldy bathroom facilities, and insufficient provision for appropriate clothing and hygiene items. The DONE Act would: Require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress that includes a plan to decrease the number of detention beds by 50% of the number available during fiscal year 2018 by using alternatives to detention that are less costly to the taxpayer and have been shown to be successful.Require the DHS Office of Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections of ICE detention facilities to ensure compliance with national standards, focusing on the health, safety, and care of detainees, especially as it relates to pregnant women. DHS OIG shall submit a report of its findings to Congress.Require the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to conduct investigations and submit a report of its findings to Congress.Mandate that facility contracts will be terminated for facilities receiving less than adequate ratings in the two most recent inspections, audits, or investigations conducted by DHS OIG."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1361671/harris-reintroduces-legislation-addressing-rights-and-conditions-of-immigrants-in-detention&speechType=6	Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-reintroduces-legislation-addressing-rights-and-conditions-of-immigrants-in-detention

Harris (D-CA) on Thursday released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Justice's announcement that the Federal Bureau of Prisons will resume federal capital punishment after nearly two decades. Harris has opposed the death penalty throughout her career: ""Today is a sad day for the United States. The administration's decision to resume the death penalty is both misguided and immoral. As a career law enforcement official, I have long opposed the death penalty because it is discriminatory, irreversible, ineffective, and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. ""Our justice system is supposed to treat all equally, but the death penalty has been proven to be unequally applied. Black and Latino defendants are far more likely to be executed than their white counterparts. And poor defendants are far more likely to enter death row than those who can afford strong representation. Your race or your bank account should not determine your sentence. ""The death penalty is also a waste of taxpayer money , money that could be invested in schools, health care, and restorative justice programs. ""And in America, the death penalty has been imposed as a final punishment on many who were later found to be innocent. Between 1973 and 2016, for every ten people executed, more than one person has been exonerated. Killing even one innocent person is too many. ""There must be swift and serious consequences for those who murder another human being, but the death penalty will not make our country safer.

Russian operatives set out to divide the American people by taking advantage of existing divisions in American society, particularly on the issue of race, to stoke fear and influence voter turnout. The Russian influence operation delivered disinformation and inflammatory content, on a massive scale, aimed at deepening fissures among the American people and weakening our national security. ""Russia engaged in tactics designed to suppress the votes of Black Americans in particular. Russian operatives fraudulently posed as Black Americans to actively discourage the Black community from voting. Social media companies must step up their efforts to fight disinformation and remove inflammatory content on their platforms, including by ensuring their workforces are diverse enough to identify and understand the cultural nuances that foreign actors exploit to divide and harm Americans. ""And let's be honest: it's time for the President of the United States to stop playing into our adversaries' hands. With every dishonest and inflammatory tweet, the president advances the interests of our adversaries by dividing the American people. This bipartisan report should cause social media companies to seriously question the role they play in advancing the president's dangerous rhetoric. ""Defending the integrity of our elections must not be a partisan issue. Hostile foreign powers will seek to promote candidates who they perceive to promote their interests, regardless of party. This is an ongoing threat against our national security and our democracy. Our work to secure our elections for 2020 and beyond will only be successful if we understand that our diversity is our strength and that our power ultimately comes from our unity."" Among the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings in the second volume of its report were: ""Russia's targeting of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was part of a broader, sophisticated, and ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society."" (pg. 5) ""IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."" (pg. 8) ""Three types of voter suppression campaigns on Facebook and Instagram emerge, including: ""a) turnout suppression/election boycott; b) third-candidate promotion; and c) candidate attack, all targeting nonwhites or likely Clinton voters."" (pg. 35) ""[N]o single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans. By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."" (pg. 38) ""Evidence of the IRA's overwhelming operational emphasis on race is evident in the IRA's Facebook advertisement content (over 66 percent contained a term related to race) and targeting (locational targeting was principally aimed at ""African-Americans in key metropolitan areas with well-established black communities and flashpoints in the Black Lives Matter movement')."" (pg. 38) ""The groups that they made to reach out to Black people were specifically targeted with ""Don't Vote for Hillary Clinton,' ""Don't Vote At All,' ""Why Would We Be Voting,' ""Our Votes Don't Matter,' [and] ""A Vote for Jill Stein is Not a Wasted Vote.'""

Harris (D-CA) joined Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), along with Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in introducing the Homeland Security Improvement Act, legislation that addresses some of the nation's immigration challenges at the southwest border and improves Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engagement with border communities. The bill establishes an ombudsman for border and immigration enforcement related concerns within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better ensure accountability, transparency, and oversight. The corresponding House bill sponsored by U.S. Representative Veronica Escobar (D-TX), H.R. 2203, passed in a 230-194 vote in September 2019. ""Since the beginning of this administration, the Department of Homeland Security has been a party to human rights abuses against immigrant children, multiple deaths in U.S. custody, abhorrent conditions in detention centers, and so much more. DHS's actions have shocked the American people and severely damaged our nation's standing as a safe haven for those fleeing violence and oppression,"" said Harris. ""We must prevent this in the future. We must require training, oversight, and accountability within DHS to ensure the department respects the basic dignity of every person."" Currently, DHS develops its own rules and policies for the conduct of operations along the border without meaningful input from stakeholders, particularly border communities , creating increasing tension between the agency and the public. The Homeland Security Improvement Act significantly improves DHS operations by mandating community input on enforcement policies and programs and improves transparency by requiring robust reporting on actions and operations. DHS routinely fails to respond, investigate, or provide appropriate redress to public complaints. Complainants frequently wait months or years, only to receive form letters, if anything at all, in response to serious complaints alleging misconduct and mismanagement. DHS also directs individuals to file complaints through a confusing variety of processes, resulting in departmental inefficiency and public confusion about where and how to address concerns. This inadequate process exacerbates tensions between the agency and the communities in which it operates, which contributes to public dissatisfaction and lower agency morale. The creation of an ombudsman will alleviate these issues by increasing transparency and accountability and assisting individuals in resolving complaints."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1381562/harris-senate-democrats-introduce-the-homeland-security-improvement-act&speechType=6	National Security		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-senate-democrats-introduce-the-homeland-security-improvement-act

""Our dedicated Foreign Service Officers travel far from home, often to dangerous places, to advance America's interests abroad,"" said Senator Harris.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday vowed to assist California cities in seeking Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grant funding to mitigate such blackouts in the future. Earlier this year, at the urging of Senator Harris, FEMA confirmed Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds could be used toward microgrid infrastructure that would help communities be more resilient to large-scale blackouts. ""Let's be real, in 2019, no community in America should be forced to endure an intentional blackout because an outdated electrical grid threatens to spark a devastating fire. While climate change is exacerbating conditions, we can all agree that the situation we're in is a result of years of poor planning and misplaced priorities on the part of PG&E, as well as a broader failure by utilities across the state to adequately prepare for the wildfire challenges we now face,"" said Harris. ""The long-term solution we need to ensure these mass shutoffs aren't the new normal is a more resilient, distributed energy system in our state. We can start by upgrading and decentralizing our critical infrastructure like public safety facilities, hospitals, community centers, and schools,"" Harris added. ""At my urging earlier this year, FEMA confirmed that FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds can be used toward microgrids and other clean, distributed energy resources that would make communities more resilient to mass blackouts.

Harris (D-CA) on Monday released a statement as wildfires continued to spread across California and blackouts continued to impact communities in fire-prone areas. Earlier this year, at the urging of Senator Harris, FEMA confirmed Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds could be used toward microgrid infrastructure that would help communities be more resilient to large-scale blackouts. ""My thoughts are with the tens of thousands of Californians who have been forced to evacuate their homes as wildfires have spread throughout our state, as well as the millions who have been impacted by blackouts. I also want to thank the firefighters and first responders who are working tirelessly and heroically to preserve life and property. I am absolutely committed to helping California receive every federal resource necessary to fight these fires, help those affected recover, and build more resilient communities as we look to the future. ""California must not be made to fight alone in this, the federal government can and must do more to help our state mitigate the impact of these wildfires and blackouts. Already, I've confirmed with FEMA that Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds can be used toward microgrid infrastructure that would help communities maintain power for critical facilities during large-scale blackouts. ""But that's not nearly enough. Any long-term solution to this crisis needs to involve serious accountability for California's utility companies, which for too long have avoided making the investments necessary to maintain safe power lines and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. We need a more resilient and distributed energy system in our state, and we need to start providing communities with the resources they need to build resilience to power shutoffs and defense to wildfires. We also need to ensure that FEMA understands and is properly equipped to deal with the unique challenges wildfires present in California and in other states across the nation. ""As the climate crisis contributes to the growing frequency and intensity of these fires, we must finally begin to take seriously the threat posed by extreme weather and recognize that blackouts and wildfires have the greatest impact on vulnerable communities, such as people with disabilities, the elderly, children, low-income communities, and communities of color. Keeping our state safe and securing climate justice will require us to work towards a bold, comprehensive solution to fight climate change and preserve our planet for our children and grandchildren. ""Congress has a responsibility to take action as well, which is why I'm drafting legislation that will provide communities with the funding they need to invest in science-based strategies to protect themselves from wildfires, such as hardening infrastructure, implementing microgrids and other distributed energy resources, maintaining defensible space, evacuation planning, and community education. ""Californians should not have to live in fear of a wildfire season that seems to get worse with every passing year. Fires are inevitable as part of the natural ecosystem, but the number of human-caused fires and the scale of destruction we've seen in recent memory is not. Wildfires are ultimately a foreseeable challenge that our state and communities can prepare for if provided with the appropriate resources and if we finally take a comprehensive approach to the climate crisis. California's elected officials across the local, state, and federal government must work together to protect our state, and I am committed to being a leader in this urgent and necessary effort."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1381566/harris-statement-on-wildfires-and-blackouts-across-california-long-term-solutions-to-climate-change-driven-crisis&speechType=6	Environment		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-wildfires-and-blackouts-across-california-long-term-solutions-to-climate-change-driven-crisis

""So, I know firsthand that, for many working parents, juggling between school schedules and work schedules is a common cause of stress and financial hardship. But, this does not have to be the case. My bill provides an innovative solution that will help reduce the burden of child care on working families. It is time we modernize the school schedule to better meet the needs of our students and their families."" Throughout the United States, current school schedules make life harder for working families. Research shows that schools are shut down for an average of 29 days throughout the school year. With the vast majority of schools closing at or around 3 pm, two hours short of the standard full-time work day, parents are often left in a bind. Additionally, summer breaks present a challenge; in fact, three in four parents report at least some difficulty finding child care during that time period. The economic cost of this problem is substantial. Schools are closed for two weeks longer than the typical American with paid leave has in paid holidays and vacation. Further, 39 percent of all workers, and 80 percent of low-wage workers, lack access to any paid vacation time. This places a financial burden on parents and caregivers to either pay for additional child care or take leave without pay to care for their child. While the misalignment of school and work schedules affects all families, low-income households often shoulder the greatest burden especially those with unpredictable or inflexible work schedules. The Family Friendly Schools Act will create a first-of-its-kind pilot program to give schools resources to stay open during the entire work day throughout the school year and to invest over $1 billion in enriching summer learning programs , all without forcing teachers to work longer hours or for less pay."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1382388/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act&speechType=6	K-12 Education Family		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act

""Over the past month, communities across California have been forced to endure mass blackouts, some lasting for nearly a week, in order to prevent PG&E's aging and faulty equipment from sparking a deadly wildfire. Now, as these communities begin to recover, it has become clear that PG&E was not prepared to properly assist many families, particularly immigrant families and families that primarily speak Spanish. ""My staff has been a regular presence on the ground at the Healdsburg Local Assistance Center (LAC) since the outbreak of the Kincade Fire in late October. At the Healdsburg LAC, they have observed that PG&E claims forms are only available in English, despite the fact that the burden of last month's power shutoffs fell disproportionately on Spanish-speaking communities. A PG&E representative has assured my staff that they are currently in the process of translating these, and I hope they will honor that commitment. ""Further, my staff has observed PG&E employees asking individuals for their IDs. There is no reasonable justification for PG&E staff to make this request, especially given the hostile environment that this administration has fostered towards immigrant communities. PG&E leadership must immediately make it clear that this is unacceptable and that everybody, regardless of status, is eligible for recovery assistance.

Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday introduced the Accountability for Utility Executives Act, legislation to ensure that publicly-traded utility companies going through bankruptcy cannot reward their executives with bonuses or trips. This year in California, utility companies have left millions of people up and down the state without power in order to avoid sparking wildfires and to limit their own legal and financial liability. ""Years of corporate negligence and misplaced priorities by energy utilities like PG&E have caused devastating fires and costly blackouts, which is exactly what happens when publicly traded utilities put corporate profits and stock prices above their customers and public safety,"" said Harris. ""My commonsense bill will make sure executives of bankrupt utility companies won't be rewarded with big bonuses and free trips after their failures leave millions of people without essential services like power or water. These companies should serve the people, not plunge them into darkness or cause a massive wildfire, and they shouldn't cash in after years of systemic failures."" In January, PG&E, which provides electricity to approximately 16 million people in Northern California, filed for bankruptcy protection after state regulators determined its equipment had sparked 17 wildfires in 2017, raising the possibility that PG&E would face tens of billions of dollars of liability. In June, PG&E announced plans to give its top executives nearly $11 million in bonuses, which a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge later halted.

VSKH1911201974	Kamala Harris	2019-11-19	Following Supreme Court Oral Argument, Harris Resolution Affirms 150-Year-Old Federal Civil Rights Law	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Monday introduced a Senate resolution affirming the importance of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Section 1981, one of the country's fundamental anti-discrimination laws. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced a companion resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives. Harris' resolution follows oral argument in the United States Supreme Court case, Comcast Corporation v. National Association of African American-Owned Media and Entertainment Studios Networks, Inc. The issue before the Court is whether victims of race discrimination must meet the burdensome ""but-for"" causation standard in order to proceed with claims under the oldest federal civil rights law. If successful, Comcast's arguments would narrow a key civil rights law that protects against race discrimination. ""Just one year after the end of the Civil War, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to remove barriers to contracting and Black economic advancement,"" said Senator Harris. ""It ensured that newly freed slaves enjoyed the same rights as other citizens. This case threatens to limit the effectiveness of our oldest civil rights law and could prevent countless victims, particularly Black people and people of color, from pursuing claims of race discrimination in our courts. That is why I am proud to lead my Senate colleagues in a resolution to affirm the importance of upholding longstanding protections against discrimination. I thank Congresswoman Waters for her tireless leadership in the fight for justice."" ""More than a century after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, it is absolutely outrageous that one of the largest media companies in the world would have the audacity to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear arguments in a case that undermines this vital law,"" said Congresswoman Waters. ""Nearly ten years ago when Comcast sought to merge with NBC Universal, both companies were forced, under pressure from my efforts in Congress and the FCC, to commit to credible diversity and inclusion initiatives as a condition for the merger. Today, they are seeking to effectively destroy one of our nation's oldest civil rights statutes dating back to Reconstruction. In doing so, Comcast is opening the flood gates to discrimination in business contracts with no legal remedy or recourse. Those of us who know our history, understand all too well the harmful impact this could have on future generations of entrepreneurs and creators of color. I am proud to lead my colleagues in a resolution that makes clear that any and all assaults on civil rights protections for Americans , particularly people of color and other marginalized groups , will not be tolerated by the U.S. Congress."" The statute at issue in the case, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, was passed immediately after the Civil War as part of a broader effort to ensure that newly freed slaves enjoyed the same rights as other citizens. The Ninth Circuit interpreted Section 1981 to allow victims to allege that race was a motivating factor for a defendant's refusal to contract, rather than the ""but for"" cause of harm. Comcast appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it argues for a burdensome pleading standard that would greatly limit access to the courts for victims of discrimination. On September 30, Harris led an amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court in support of the Ninth Circuit's ruling, arguing that, under the statute, plaintiffs can proceed with claims where race discrimination is a motivating factor, but not the sole cause of harm. Harris' resolution is joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), and is supported by the NAACP."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1385266/following-supreme-court-oral-argument-harris-resolution-affirms-150-year-old-federal-civil-rights-law&speechType=6	Civil Liberties and Civil Rights		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/following-supreme-court-oral-argument-harris-resolution-affirms-150-year-old-federal-civil-rights-law
VSKH1911201973	Kamala Harris	2019-11-19	Harris Introduces Legislation to Ensure Toxic Waste Sites Are Resilient to Climate Change	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday introduced the Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act, legislation requiring the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to incorporate climate change into their plans for overseeing Superfund sites, which contain toxic waste and other contaminants harmful to Americans' health. While the Trump administration yesterday rejected a recommendation from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to consider the impact of climate change on these toxic waste sites, Harris' legislation would mandate this under the law. On Monday, the GAO released a report concluding that Superfund sites across the country are underprepared for the impact of the climate crisis, which has the potential to disrupt toxic sites and release contaminants into the environment and surrounding communities. In December 2017, Harris led a letter to the GAO requesting such a report. ""We can no longer ignore the fact that the climate crisis is here and it's in our backyard. Hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters are growing in intensity and threatening to unleash some of our nation's most toxic sites on surrounding areas, especially waste sites located in close proximity to low-income communities and communities of color,"" said Senator Harris. ""My legislation will ensure that the EPA and those responsible incorporate climate change into cleanup plans for current and future Superfund sites and that we are preserving our nation's ability to clean up pollution and protect communities in the era of a changing climate."" In recent years, natural disasters have had a direct impact on Superfund sites and risked serious harm to communities already reeling from the devastation of natural disasters. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey led to floods at 13 Superfund sites and breaches at two. In 2018, the Carr Fire in California burned through the Iron Mountain Mine site causing fires in pipes necessary to clean up the site and had the potential to result in an explosion that would have expelled dangerous chemicals throughout the surrounding area. Specifically, the Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act: Requires the potential threat to human health and the environment associated with local natural disasters and hazards due to climate change to be incorporated into any plans to clean-up a superfund site; andRequires that local natural disasters and extreme weather hazards, including any projected exacerbation or change in those disasters and hazards due to climate change be taken into account in the periodic review of whether a clean-up plan is adequately protective."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1385269/harris-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-toxic-waste-sites-are-resilient-to-climate-change&speechType=6	Environment		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-toxic-waste-sites-are-resilient-to-climate-change
VSKH2011201972	Kamala Harris	2019-11-20	Harris Applauds House Committee Passage of Marijuana Reform Legislation	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday applauded the House Judiciary Committee after it advanced the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, a comprehensive marijuana reform bill introduced by Senator Harris and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). ""As more states legalize marijuana, millions of Americans with marijuana-related convictions continue to face overwhelming barriers to jobs, education, and housing,"" said Senator Harris. ""That is why we must act to remove the burden of marijuana convictions and make sure these individuals have the support needed to move forward. It is also critical that everyone , especially people of color who have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs , has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry. This is a matter of racial and economic justice. I am grateful for Chairman Nadler's partnership on this issue and for his leadership in moving this legislation forward. I look forward to the House of Representatives passing our legislation soon."" ""I have long believed that the criminalization of marijuana has been a mistake, and the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana laws has only compounded this mistake,"" said Chairman Nadler. ""While states have led the way in reform, our federal laws have not kept pace with the obvious need for change. With the passage of the MORE Act today, the Judiciary Committee has taken long overdue steps to address the devastating injustices caused by the War on Drugs and to finally decriminalize marijuana at the federal level."" The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act aims to correct the historical injustices of failed drug policies that have disproportionately impacted communities of color and low-income communities by requiring resentencing and expungement of prior convictions. This will create new opportunities for individuals as they work to advance their careers, education, and overall quality of life. Immigrants will also benefit from the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, as they will no longer be subject to deportation or citizenship denial based solely on a marijuana offense. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act also ensures that all benefits in the law are available to juvenile offenders. Specifically, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act: Legalizes marijuana at the federal level by removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act. This applies retroactively to prior and pending convictions, and enables states to set their own policy.Requires federal courts to expunge prior convictions, allows prior offenders to request expungement, and requires courts, on motion, to conduct re-sentencing hearings for those still under supervision.Authorizes the assessment of a 5% sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products to create an Opportunity Trust Fund, which includes three grant programs:The Community Reinvestment Grant Program: Provides services to the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, including job training, re-entry services, legal aid, literacy programs, youth recreation, mentoring, and substance use treatment. The Cannabis Opportunity Grant Program: Provides funds for loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.The Equitable Licensing Grant Program: Provides funds for programs that minimize barriers to marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.Opens up Small Business Administration funding for legitimate cannabis-related businesses and service providers.Provides non-discrimination protections for marijuana use or possession, and for prior convictions for a marijuana offense:Prohibits the denial of any federal public benefit (including housing) based on the use or possession of marijuana, or prior conviction for a marijuana offense.Provides that the use or possession of marijuana, or prior conviction for a marijuana offense, will have no adverse impact under the immigration laws.Requires the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect data on the demographics of the industry to ensure people of color and those who are economically disadvantaged are participating in the industry.The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act has the support of a broad coalition of civil rights, criminal justice, drug policy, and immigration groups."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1385845/harris-applauds-house-committee-passage-of-marijuana-reform-legislation&speechType=6	Marijuana		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-applauds-house-committee-passage-of-marijuana-reform-legislation
VSKH2111201971	Kamala Harris	2019-11-21	Harris, Colleagues Call Out Trump Admin Efforts to Promote Junk Health Care Plans	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday joined Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and 20 of their colleagues in sending a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), requesting that the agencies answer for the Trump administration's efforts to promote junk plans to the American public during the Open Enrollment period for health insurance coverage. The Senators draw attention to the fact that the Trump administration-operated HealthCare.gov website is now directing consumers during the ongoing Open Enrollment period to junk plans through third-party brokers, with little to no information about the lack of coverage provided by these so-called ""short-term"" plans. One of the Trump administration's most fervent efforts to undermine and unravel the Affordable Care Act is through the expansion of these junk health insurance plans that lack protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Along with Senators Harris, Shaheen, and Stabbenow, the letter is signed by Senators Baldwin (D-WI), Tester (D-MT), Smith (D-MN), Cardin (D-MD), Merkley (D-OR), Murphy (D-CT), Casey (D-PA), Udall (D-NM), Feinstein (D-CA), Hassan (D-NH), Murray (D-WA), Schatz (D-HI), Hirono (D-HI), Warren (D-MA), Whitehouse (D-RI), King (I-ME), Wyden (D-OR), Klobuchar (D-MN), Blumenthal (D-CT), and Schumer (D-NY). The Senators write, in part, ""We are extremely concerned that the increased availability of junk plans and lack of oversight by CMS will cause consumers who believe they are purchasing ACA-compliant health plans to inadvertently sign-up for junk plan coverage that is less comprehensive and could expose them to higher out-of-pocket costs. Americans who purchase these junk plans risk being denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and left vulnerable to unexpected gaps in coverage and massive medical bills in the case of health care emergencies."" The letter continues, ""Insurance brokers are now aggressively marketing junk plans to consumers, including consumers who come to the HealthCare.gov portal seeking comprehensive coverage and then click on links that re-direct them to web brokers and phone-based broker services."" The Senators point to the provision in the ACA that prohibits the health care exchange from making plans available that don't meet the ACA's coverage standards and write, ""It is also unclear what statutory authority CMS relies upon to authorize the re-direction of HealthCare.gov customers toward third-party broker entities that sell ACA-compliant coverage and junk plan coverage on the same platforms."" The Senators underscore that junk plans were never intended to be an alternative to comprehensive health coverage and pose dangerous risks for consumers. The administration's persistent efforts to expand junk plans, which includes extending the duration from 90 days to 364 days and encouraging states to apply for waivers from the ACA that would allow ACA premium tax credits to be used to subsidize junk plan coverage, risk confusing Americans into thinking these plans offer the same coverage as those that meet the ACA's standards. In closing, the Senators wrote, ""We are calling on HHS and CMS to take action to limit the availability of junk plans and take steps to ensure that consumers using HealthCare.gov are being offered comprehensive health insurance, receiving premium tax credits, and being enrolled in Medicaid, if eligible. Furthermore, CMS should take action to hold insurance brokers accountable when they mislead HealthCare.gov customers and misrepresent junk plans as safe alternatives to ACA-complaint health insurance coverage. During this year's Open Enrollment period, it is essential that you act fast in order to protect consumers."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1385848/harris-colleagues-call-out-trump-admin-efforts-to-promote-junk-health-care-plans&speechType=6	Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-call-out-trump-admin-efforts-to-promote-junk-health-care-plans-

""The United States must always be a place where refugees are welcomed and encouraged to contribute to society,"" said Harris. ""But, from day one, the Trump administration turned its back on refugees and abdicated our nation's moral responsibility to welcome children and families fleeing ongoing persecution. It's not enough to undo the harm that has already been done, we must also revitalize our refugee and asylum system and expand protections for these individuals. That's why I'm proud to join Senator Leahy in introducing the Refugee Protection Act, which would guarantee that refugees and asylum-seekers are welcomed and supported in our country and that our immigration system respects the basic dignity of every human being.""

VSKH2611201969	Kamala Harris	2019-11-26	Harris, Colleagues Introduce New Legislation to Protect Workers, Ensure Dignity in The Workplace	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) joined Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) in introducing the Treating Workers With Dignity Act, new legislation that would guarantee employees receive a break to eat a meal, use the restroom, or tend to their medical needs. ""It is time we raise the bar for every worker in our country, and guarantee the right to take rest and meal breaks for all working people,"" said Senator Harris. ""I am proud to join my colleagues to introduce this important legislation which will take steps to ensure working people receive the dignity and respect they deserve."" Along with Harris and Schatz, the legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ). Under current federal law, employers in the United States have no legal obligation to provide workers a break in order to eat a meal, use the restroom, or tend to their medical needs. As a result, some employers have taken advantage of the absence of these protections by showing little regard their workers. For example, separate reports by the Government Accountability Office and Oxfam America found that employees in the poultry industry routinely are denied bathroom breaks, forcing many to defecate on themselves or wear adult diapers rather than lose their jobs. The Treating Workers with Dignity Act would provide employees the opportunity to attend to their basic needs during the course of their workday. This legislation would: -Require employers to provide employees the option for an uninterrupted 30-minute break in which an employee can eat, for any shift lasting at least six hours.-Allow employees to take short, paid breaks to tend to a documented medical condition.-Ensure employers provide their employees the opportunity to take a paid restroom break at least once every four hours that they work."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1392217/harris-colleagues-introduce-new-legislation-to-protect-workers-ensure-dignity-in-the-workplace&speechType=6	Employment and Affirmative Action		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-new-legislation-to-protect-workers-ensure-dignity-in-the-workplace

The resolution encourages individuals, families, and households across the United States to take part in the Census so that all communities can be counted. ""Accurately counting every single American in the U.S. Census ensures representation among all communities and allows for legislative seats and federal funds to be allocated correctly,"" said Senator Harris. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues in this bipartisan resolution, it is critical to our nation's future that everyone is counted."" The 2020 Census is a constitutionally mandated undertaking. The data collected is used to properly allocate seats for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures. It also directs more than $800 billion annually in federal funding to state and local communities.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and John Hoeven (R-ND), along with 22 senators and 52 representatives, in filing an amicus brief in federal court defending the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The bipartisan and bicameral brief was filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as the court re-opens its August ruling that affirmed ICWA's constitutionality in Brackeen v. Bernhardt. ""The Indian Child Welfare Act has protected Native American children and kept them connected with their families and communities for over 40 years,"" said Senator Harris. ""It is vital that the Fifth Circuit upholds the constitutionality of ICWA, we must support tribes as they fight to protect Native American children."" The amicus brief urges the Fifth Circuit to uphold the court's previous decision affirming the constitutionality of IWCA. The decision the Fifth Circuit issued in August reversed a ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas which wrongly struck down ICWA as unconstitutional. Congress passed ICWA in 1978 after receiving testimony that 25 to 35 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native children were removed from their homes by state and private adoption agencies. ICWA sets best-practice standards for child welfare and adoption proceedings involving children who are members of a federally-recognized Tribe or are eligible for membership in a federally-recognized Tribe. Over four decades, the law has become the ""gold standard"" for child welfare policy and keeping Native children connected to their communities and cultures."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1392226/harris-lawmakers-file-amicus-brief-supporting-the-indian-child-welfare-act&speechType=6	Minors and Children Indigenous Peoples Judicial Branch		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-lawmakers-file-amicus-brief-supporting-the-indian-child-welfare-act

VSKH131202062	Kamala Harris	2020-01-13	Ahead of Impeachment Trial, Harris Delivers Speech on Fight for the Integrity of the American System of Justice	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Monday delivered remarks on the floor of the United States Senate as the Senate prepared to receive articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. I n the speech, Harris laid out her view of the Senate's duty to ensure the integrity of the American system of justice, as well as her commitment to ensuring that nobody, including the president, is above the law. Key excerpts from Harris' remarks: We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? [ ] This moment in our history will have consequences. The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions , or whether we will finally live up to the principle: ""Equal Justice Under Law.'There is no question that President Trump's misconduct has left a vacuum of leadership in our country, and the American people are looking to the United States Senate to demonstrate that their leaders are worthy of the public's trust. The American people should expect their representatives in the Senate to seek the truth, not cover up the facts.In that ongoing fight, we in the United States Senate must agree that we cannot speak about the ideals of equality and justice and then act in ways that violate those very principles. It is our duty both as senators and proud Americans to protect the Constitution, earn the people's trust, and prove to the American people that it is still within the power of the United States Congress to hold the president accountable.Full transcript of Harris' remarks: Just across the street from where I stand today sits the United States Supreme Court. That building has four words etched in marble above its entrance: ""Equal Justice Under Law.' The promise of those four words is that in our country, our system of justice must treat everyone equally, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, or socioeconomic status. But too many people in our country grow up knowing and experiencing that in America we have two systems of justice: one in which certain people are held accountable, and another in which powerful people like Donald Trump escape accountability altogether. This has been true from the first days of our nation's history, when a group of men gathered in Philadelphia to debate lofty notions of justice and equality, yet produced a document that literally counted Black Americans as fractions of a person. In the Declaration of Independence, we were told that ""All men are created equal' , but we know that in our nation's founding, at that time the policy of our nation was to rob indigenous people of their land and their livelihood and to exclude women from the right to vote. So, to make true the promise of America and move us toward that more perfect union, people have organized, fought, and marched for justice. From the suffragettes to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., those fights have won us progress towards a more just and inclusive nation. But clearly there is still more work to be done to achieve ""Equal Justice Under Law.' When the determination of whether you sit in jail before trial is too often based on the size of your bank account rather than the size of your crime, we have not yet achieved ""Equal Justice Under Law.' There is more work to be done when young people selling drugs on the corner too often become felons for life while white collar criminals face no accountability. There is more work to be done when regarding the sexual assault of women, the current president has said, ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.' There is work to be done when the American people know that the rules aren't equally enforced against powerful people. Unless we acknowledge these truths, too many Americans will remain distrustful of our institutions and cynical about our government and our leaders. And this is the point, my colleagues. We now face a choice: will we insist that we have one system of justice that applies equally to all? Or will we continue to have two systems of justice, in which some are above the law? Later this week, the Senate will likely begin the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. This moment in our history will have consequences. The Senate is charged with deciding whether the President of the United States, with all of his power and supposed wealth, will be held accountable for his actions , and whether we will finally live up to the principle: ""Equal Justice Under Law.' This is why I speak to you today, fully aware that I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me in our nation's ongoing fight for equality. I speak because I was raised by people who spent most of their lives demanding justice in the face of racism, misogyny, bigotry, and inequality. I speak because I have dedicated my entire career to upholding the rule of law and bringing integrity to our system of justice. I speak to ensure that everyone in California and throughout our country can enjoy the rights and freedoms guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution. And as a United States Senator, I speak fully prepared to uphold my solemn oath to ""support and defend the Constitution of the United States,"" and to ""do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws,"" and to affirm that my first obligation is to serve the people of the United States. All the people. I hope my colleagues can agree that our nation's founders had the foresight to create a system of checks and balances that anticipated the need to remove a president who might yield to foreign influence or use the presidency for personal power and benefit. Our founders feared that a day like this might come, and so they empowered the United States Congress with the tool of impeachment to hold a lawless president accountable. And so this week, after months of investigation, sworn testimony, public hearings, and debate, the House of Representatives will likely send to the United States Senate two articles of impeachment. These articles charge President Trump with abusing his power for his personal and political gain and with obstructing Congress's efforts to investigate his misconduct. In this trial, the United States Senate must not only consider the charges against the president, but also conduct itself in a way that demonstrates to the American people that in our system of justice, no one is above the law. Each senator must exhibit the kind of moral and ethical leadership that this president abandoned when he pressured a foreign nation to interfere in our elections. There is no question that President Trump's misconduct has left a vacuum of leadership in our country, and the American people are therefore looking to the United States Senate to demonstrate that their leaders are worthy of the public's trust. The American people should expect their senators to seek the truth, and not cover up the facts. So let us honor our oath to defend the Constitution by doing the job the American people have entrusted to us. Let us ensure that this trial is a search for truth and that we follow the facts where they lead and come to a verdict based on all of the available evidence. Let us do our jobs and insist that we hear from Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, and anyone with firsthand knowledge of the president's misconduct. Let us demand that the White House turn over additional emails and documents that shed light on the president's motives for withholding military aid from Ukraine. And let us be clear, an order from this president to block evidence or witness testimony will itself be further evidence of his efforts to obstruct the United States Congress. The importance of this moment in our history cannot be overstated. What we do in this trial will show the world who we are as a country. Our answer will also send a message to future presidents of the United States about the kind of conduct that is acceptable from the leader of our nation. As the United States Senate, we must say that it's unacceptable for a president to shake down a vulnerable foreign nation for personal or political benefit. We must say, with one voice, that no president can disregard the legitimate oversight authority of the United States Congress. And we must say, as leaders of the United States of America, that in our system of justice everyone will be held accountable for their actions, including the president of the United States. And my final point: years from now, people are going to judge whether we rose to the solemn occasion that is the impeachment trial of the president of the United States. And we cannot be passive in this moment. I am mindful of Coretta Scott King's words that ""freedom is never really won, you earn it and win it with each generation."" It is incumbent on this generation to fight for a system of justice in which all are treated equally. And in that ongoing fight, we in the United States Senate must agree that we cannot speak about the ideals of equality and justice and then act in ways that violate those very principles. It is our duty both as senators and as proud Americans to protect the Constitution, to earn the people's trust, and prove to the American people that it is still within power of the United States Congress to hold the president accountable. History is watching. Our actions here will shape this body's legacy. So I urge my colleagues to have the courage, the foresight, and the patriotism to act in the interest of our nation and its people. I urge my colleagues to fight for one system of justice in the United States of America and to ensure that no one is above the law. I urge my colleagues to reaffirm the most basic of American principles: that ours is not the government of one man, but a government of the people, by the people, and for the people."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1404704/ahead-of-impeachment-trial-harris-delivers-speech-on-fight-for-the-integrity-of-the-american-system-of-justice&speechType=6	Executive Branch Legislative Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/ahead-of-impeachment-trial-harris-delivers-speech-on-fight-for-the-integrity-of-the-american-system-of-justice

Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday released a statement on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) after voting against the deal in the Senate Budget Committee: ""It is the duty of the United States Congress to ensure that our nation's trade policies lift up workers, grow the economy, and protect public health and our environment. Trade agreements can open up new markets to American products and forge new alliances with foreign countries. They can also lead to job losses, depressed wages, and environmental degradation. Living in a state with the largest and most diverse economy in the nation, Californians have seen both the good and the bad up close. My responsibility as their senator is to listen to their concerns and learn from the mistakes of past trade deals. ""I recognize the hard work of negotiators in Congress and organized labor, especially Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the AFL-CIO, that dramatically improved the USMCA from the one negotiated by the Trump administration. ""However, after careful study and consultation with environmental and conservation leaders, I have concluded that the USMCA's environmental provisions are insufficient, and by not addressing climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of this moment. Californians know that the climate crisis is already here. Communities across our state have experienced exacerbated fires, storms, floods, and drought, and the devastation will only get worse if we fail to take bold and immediate action to address it. This agreement will set the standards for decades, and I believe Californians and all Americans deserve better and more immediate action.

VSKH171202058	Kamala Harris	2020-01-17	Harris, Colleagues Question the Revolving Door Between Federal Agencies and the Private Detention Industry	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), along with Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), in sending a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) questioning their anti-corruption policies and practices after a series of high-profile officials responsible for oversight of the private prison and detention industry have left to join the biggest companies in the industry. In the last three years, ICE's acting director for the New Orleans field office left to work for LaSalle, a company that operates six facilities in the region; ICE's official in charge of contracting left to work as a paid witness for private prison company GEO in a lawsuit alleging mistreatment of detained people; BOP's assistant director, who was involved in oversight of private prisons, left to become GEO's director of operations; and the acting head of ICE left to become Executive Vice President for contract compliance at GEO. ""The growing connections between the federal government and the for-profit prison and detention industry are made more troubling by the fact that in recent years, a number of key officials have left ICE and BOP to work for private prison and immigration detention companies , with several of these officials in positions where they work with or solicit business from their former colleagues,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""This pattern of high-level ICE and BOP officials leaving their posts to work for the same companies that they were in charge of regulating raises questions and concerns about corruption and compliance with federal contracting and conflict of interest law."" In their letter, the lawmakers note particular concerns about compliance with federal contracting and conflict of interest law, including: Federal contracting law, which prohibits former federal agency officials from receiving compensation as ""an employee, officer, director, or consultant"" from a contractor that received an award of at least $10 million for at least one year after leaving the agency.Federal conflict of interest laws, which ban federal employees from participating ""personally and substantially"" in any particular matters that impact their financial interest or the financial interest of ""any person or organization with whom [the employee] is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment.""Federal regulations, which further prohibit employees from working on particular matters if they are ""seeking employment"" with a person or organization impacted by the matter, even if negotiations are not ongoing.President Trump's executive order on ethics commitments by executive branch appointees, which restricts agency appointees from lobbying their former agency for five years.The lawmakers have requested that the agencies' response describe how they are working to ensure compliance with federal law and prevent corruption and conflicts of interest."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1404720/harris-colleagues-question-the-revolving-door-between-federal-agencies-and-the-private-detention-industry&speechType=6	Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-question-the-revolving-door-between-federal-agencies-and-the-private-detention-industry
VSKH281202057	Kamala Harris	2020-01-28	Harris, Feinstein, Colleagues Call for a National Commitment to Refugee Resettlement on Third Anniversary of Trump ...	statement	"U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Tuesday joined Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and 14 of their colleagues in introducing a resolution marking the third anniversary of President Trump's executive order barring immigrants from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States, and calling on Congress to reaffirm the United States' commitment to providing a safe haven for refugees fleeing oppression including the tens of thousands of asylum seekers facing violence in Mexico under the administration's inhumane policies. Three years ago, President Trump issued the first of three executive orders banning refugees, immigrants, and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries to the United States. Since then, the Trump Administration has continued to pursue anti-immigrant, anti-refugee policies rooted in religious and nationality-based discrimination, with additional bans looming. ""The United States is and will always be a nation of immigrants, and our strength comes from our diversity,"" said Senator Harris. ""As the president continues to push his anti-immigrant agenda, we must recommit to our humanity as a nation, to our responsibility to welcome immigrants and refugees, and to our fight against religious and ethnic discrimination."" As the global displacement crisis continues to worsen , with more than 25,400,000 refugees worldwide , the resolution directs the United States to commit to resettle a robust number of refugees to meet its share of the global need. The United States set a record low in refugee admissions for 2020 by allowing just 18,000 refugees. Along with Harris, Feinstein, and Blumenthal, the resolution is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Chris Coons (D-DE). The full text of the resolution is copied below. Title: Recognizing January 27, 2020, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban, calling on Congress to defund the Migrant Protection Protocols, and urging the President to restore refugee resettlement to historic norms. Whereas the world is in the midst of the worst global displacement crisis in history, with more than 25,900,000 refugees worldwide, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates; Whereas UNHCR reports that global resettlement needs have doubled in recent years, reaching over 1,440,000 refugees in 2020; Whereas the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) is a life-saving solution critical to global humanitarian efforts, which serves to strengthen global security, leverage United States foreign policy goals, and support regional host countries while serving individuals and families in need; Whereas the United States has been a global leader in responding to displacement crises around the world and promoting the safety, health, and well-being of refugees and displaced persons; Whereas refugees are the most vetted travelers to enter the United States and are subject to extensive screening checks, including in-person interviews, biometric data checks, and multiple interagency checks; Whereas the United States Government leverages resettlement to encourage other countries to keep their doors open to refugees, allow refugee children to attend school, and allow adults to work; Whereas the USRAP emphasizes early self-sufficiency through employment, and most adult refugees are employed within their first six months of arriving to the United States; Whereas refugees contribute to their communities by starting businesses, paying taxes, sharing their cultural traditions, and being involved in their neighborhoods, and reports have found that refugees contribute more than they consume in State-funded services, including for schooling and health care; Whereas, for over 40 years, the United States has resettled up to 200,000 refugees per year, with an average admissions goal of 95,000 refugees per year; Whereas the United States Government has abdicated its leadership by setting a record-low refugee admissions goal in fiscal year 2020 at 18,000; Whereas, on January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump released an executive order banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees from entering the country; Whereas, since that time, the President has taken further executive and administrative actions to ban people from Muslim-majority countries and to dismantle the United States refugee program, resulting in significantly lowered capacity and loss of institutional memory and experience in the historically successful USRAP; Whereas the President issued a Proclamation on November 9, 2018, that wrongfully and illegally blocks people who cross between ports of entry from applying for asylum, and since then has taken further aggressive steps to dismantle the United States asylum system; Whereas the Department of Homeland Security started implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols on January 29, 2019, and it has exposed tens of thousands of asylum seekers to torture, kidnapping, trafficking, and exploitation by returning them to dangerous border cities in Mexico; Whereas the 2018 Department of State country report for Mexico acknowledges serious and targeted risks faced by migrants and asylum seekers in, and transiting through, Mexico, such that it remains an unsafe place for many; Whereas the United States has returned more than 24,000 asylum seekers alone to Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, widely recognized as among the most violent cities in the world, located in the state of Tamaulipas, which is the subject of a Department of State ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"" advisory; Whereas sending asylum seekers to another country limits and may completely eliminate their opportunity to identify and meet with counsel, thereby lowering their chances of obtaining relief; and Whereas all individuals seeking asylum in the United States are entitled to due process and access to an attorney: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate, (1) reaffirms the United States' proud history of refugee resettlement and protection of asylum seekers; (2) recognizes January 27, 2020, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban; (3) reaffirms the strong bipartisan commitment of the United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of refugees, including through resettlement and the asylum seeking process to the United States for those who cannot return home; (4) underscores the importance of the United States Refugee Admissions Program and a robust asylum system as critical tools for United States global leadership; (5) recognizes the profound consequences faced by refugees, asylum seekers, and their families who have been stranded, separated, and scarred by current United States policies, leaving thousands mid-process and more with little hope of protection in the United States; and (6) calls upon the United States Government, (A) to resettle a robust number of refugees to meet global need in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 with an emphasis on rebuilding the resettlement program and returning to historic norms; (B) to operate the program in good faith in an attempt to meet their own stated objectives, restore historic refugee arrivals, improve consultation with Congress, and adhere to the clear congressional intent within the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96, 212); (C) to ensure that no funds be made available by any Act to implement or enforce the Migrant Protection Protocols announced by the Secretary of Homeland Security on December 20, 2018, or any subsequent revisions to those protocols; (D) to enact the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, introduced in the Senate as S.1123 (116th Congress) and in the House of Representatives as H.R.2214 (116th Congress), which would terminate the Muslim, refugee, and asylum bans; and (E) to recommit to offering freedom to individuals fleeing from persecution and oppression regardless of their country of origin or religious beliefs."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1404730/harris-feinstein-colleagues-call-for-a-national-commitment-to-refugee-resettlement-on-third-anniversary-of-trumps-travel-ban&speechType=6	National Security Foreign Affairs Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-feinstein-colleagues-call-for-a-national-commitment-to-refugee-resettlement-on-third-anniversary-of-trumps-travel-ban
VSKH281202056	Kamala Harris	2020-01-28	Harris, Feinstein, Democrats Press Health Department for Updates on Novel Coronavirus, Call for Continuing Robust, ...	statement	"U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Monday joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and 28 of their Democratic Senate colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary Alex Azar at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requesting updates on the Administration's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak and information on the steps being taken to keep families safe. In the letter, the Senators asked the Department to keep them updated with the latest information regarding the severity of the disease, the country's capacity to diagnose cases, what steps were being taken to prepare U.S. health care workers, what screening systems were in place at U.S. airports, the status of a novel coronavirus vaccine, and more. The Senators also urged the Department to continue its robust, scientifically-driven response to the outbreak and asked what steps Congress should take to support their efforts to keep families safe. ""We write to express concern about the rapidly evolving 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to urge your continued robust and scientifically driven response to the situation, and to assess whether any additional resources or action by Congress are needed at this time. A quick and effective response to the 2019-nCoV requires public health officials around the world work together to share reliable information about the disease and insight into steps taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat it appropriately,"" wrote the Senators. Despite the Trump Administration regularly calling for cuts to public health programs, Congress recently passed a budget deal that increased funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Infectious Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund, which provides the agency with an immediate source of funding to prevent, prepare for, or respond to an infectious disease emergency either at home or abroad. Along with Harris, Feinstein, and Murray, the letter was signed by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jack Reed (D-RI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mark Warner (D-VA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Angus King (I-ME), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Dear Secretary Azar, We write to express concern about the rapidly evolving 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to urge your continued robust and scientifically driven response to the situation, and to assess whether any additional resources or action by Congress are needed at this time. A quick and effective response to the 2019-nCoV requires public health officials around the world work together to share reliable information about the disease and insight into steps taken to prevent, diagnose, and treat it appropriately. Chinese health officials confirmed the first case of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. Since then, the case count has exploded in China, with nearly 3,000 confirmed cases as of the writing of this letter. At least 80 people have died. Cases have now been confirmed on four continents. On January 21, the first U.S. case was confirmed in Washington state, where state and local public health officials quickly responded with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A second U.S. case was confirmed in Chicago on January 24. Subsequently, CDC confirmed two cases in California and one in Arizona, bringing the total U.S. case count to five. Airport screening procedures have been put in place to screen all passengers arriving in the U.S. from Wuhan. In Wuhan, and across China, officials have enacted travel restrictions and canceled planned festivals to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Even with these steps, the case count in China is expected to continue to rise, along with additional cases in the U.S. and around the globe. The World Health Organization is monitoring the situation closely, but has determined it is too early to formally designate this as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A quick, robust, and comprehensive approach to this outbreak is critical, while also remaining aware that, according to CDC, ""the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is considered low at this time."" Unfortunately, the 2019-nCoV outbreak follows troubling proposals from the Trump Administration to cut the budgets of core public health programs at home and abroad. Yet, outbreaks like this serve as a solemn reminder of the need for an unwavering commitment to global health security and the need for strong public health programs worldwide. We recognize the situation is evolving quickly and appreciate the information you have already provided. We ask you keep us apprised of developments as they occur, including any information related to the following questions: 1) What can Congress do to fully support the U.S. Government response to this outbreak? 2) How many HHS officials are currently engaged in the 2019-nCoV response domestically and abroad and in what capacities? 3) What is HHS's best current judgment about the clinical severity of this disease? 4) What is the current domestic diagnostic capacity? How many facilities across the country are able to diagnose 2019-nCoV? 5) What is currently known about the risk 2019-nCoV poses to health care workers? How is CDC communicating with U.S. health care facilities to ensure providers remain healthy and safe? What additional guidance is being supplied to health care providers? 6) How many passengers have been screened by the airport screening procedures that are in place at American airports? How many potential cases have been identified as a result of this screening? Are there any planned changes to airport screening procedures? 7) What progress has been made on the development of a 2019-nCoV vaccine? Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

VSKH311202055	Kamala Harris	2020-01-31	"Harris: ""There Will Be No True Acquittal If There is Not A Fair Trial"""	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in a press conference ahead of an expected vote on whether the Senate will allow firsthand witnesses or additional documents in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. ""The American people , the vast majority of the American public , want this United States Senate to produce the new evidence,"" said Harris. ""The only place this is being debated between Republicans and Democrats is not among the American people , it is here in the United States Senate."" Harris continued, ""The evidence that we know is available will not be presented and what that means as its bottom line is that this will not have been a fair trial and therefore they cannot walk out of this building and allege and assert that there has been a true acquittal. There will be no true acquittal if there is not a fair trial."" Full transcript of Harris' remarks: HARRIS: Thank you leader Schumer for your leadership. Let's just take this to the end game and we can take it to the end game based on just a few days ago when we started. They've been trying to rush this thing through. At first they proposed that we would have two days and then their constituents said ""well that's ridiculous,"" so they extended it to three as though they were being very gracious. But they have always been focused on their end game , our Republican Senate , and the end game for them has been acquittal, but here's the deal, you cannot have a true acquittal if you have not had a fair trial. So, they are not going to get what they've been trying to get if they do not allow witnesses to come forward. This is not a fair trial. The American people , the vast majority of the American public , want this United States Senate to produce the new evidence. The only place this is being debated between Republicans and Democrats is not among the American people , it is here in the United States Senate. The American people , Republicans and Democrats , the vast majority believe that the new evidence should come forward. The vast majority of Americans who have ever walked into a courthouse as a witness, as an accused, as a juror, know that the only attributes of a fair trial in our system of justice are witnesses and documents, evidence. None of which have been produced in any meaningful way based on what we know is available here in the United States Senate. So what we're about to do today, we believe, is to have the United Sates Senate based on the majority of Senators make a decision to exclude from our process evidence that is available, that is probative of the very issue before us. Now let's talk about this in the context of the issue that is before us. There have been three impeachments of a President of the United States in the over two centuries of our history. This is the most serious in terms of the charges. Underlying the concerns of the framers of our constitution of which we all took an oath , many of us many times took that oath to protect and defend that United States Constitution. The most serious concern our framers and founders had is there would be foreign entanglement, foreign entanglement in our government, in our democracy, in our republic, in our elections. And that is the basis of Article 1 of the impeachment of Donald Trump. Is it not right if we are going to honor our oath much less these fancy lapel pins that everybody walks around here wearing? That we would fight for the integrity of this process, and that we would receive evidence that we know is available. So the bottom line is that at the end of this they will probably get what they want. Which is that we are going to end this today or maybe tomorrow, but the evidence, the evidence that we know is available will not be presented and what that means as its bottom line is that this will not have been a fair trial and therefore they cannot walk out of this building and allege and assert that there has been a true acquittal. There will be no true acquittal if there is not a fair trial."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1404731/harris-there-will-be-no-true-acquittal-if-there-is-not-a-fair-trial&speechType=6	Executive Branch Legislative Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-there-will-be-no-true-acquittal-if-there-is-not-a-fair-trial

""The State of the Union address is an opportunity for the president of the United States to speak candidly about the challenges our nation faces and the direction he or she intends to take in the year ahead. Unfortunately, President Trump chose tonight to deliver a divisive speech that ignored the real challenges that working people continue to face to make ends meet. His remarks also failed to acknowledge the ongoing threat that his own actions pose to the integrity of our system of justice. ""The president spoke this evening before members of the very institution he is currently on trial for obstructing, the United States Congress. As a member of the United States Senate, I have spent the past few weeks considering the consequences of the president's efforts to escape congressional oversight and block the testimony of firsthand witnesses in his impeachment trial. We heard a lot of words from the president tonight, but his actions demonstrate his complete disregard for the rule of law and for the principle that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1404733/harris-statement-on-state-of-the-union-address&speechType=6	Executive Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-state-of-the-union-address

Highlights from Harris' remarks: When the framers wrote the Constitution they didn't think someone like me would serve as a United States Senator.

He will want us to think that he is all powerful, and we have no power. But we're not going to let him get away with that. We're not going to give him what he wants. Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people.Full transcript of Harris' remarks below: Mr. President, when the framers wrote the Constitution they didn't think someone like me would serve as a United States Senator. But they did envision someone like Donald Trump being president of the United States. Someone who thinks that he is above the law and that the rules don't apply to him. So, they made sure our democracy had the tool of impeachment to stop that kind of abuse of power. The House managers have clearly laid out a compelling case and evidence of Donald Trump's misconduct. They have shown that the president of the United States of America withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting for his political gain. He wanted a foreign country to announce , not actually conduct , announce an investigation into his political rivals. And then he refused to comply with congressional investigations into his misconduct. And, unfortunately, a majority of United States Senators , even those who concede that what Donald Trump did was wrong , are nonetheless going to refuse to hold him accountable. The Senate trial of Donald Trump has been a miscarriage of justice. Donald Trump is going to get away with abusing his position of power for personal gain, abusing his position of power to stop Congress from looking into his misconduct, and falsely claiming he's been exonerated. He's going to escape accountability because a majority of senators have decided to let him. They voted repeatedly to block key evidence like witnesses and documents that could have shed light on the full truth. And we must recognize that still in America, there are two systems of justice , one for the powerful and another for everyone else. So let's speak the truth about what our two systems of justice actually mean in the real world. It means that in our country too many people walk into courthouses and face systemic bias. Too often they lack adequate legal representation , whether they are overworked, underpaid or both It means that a young man named Emmett Till was falsely accused and then murdered, but his murderer didn't have to spend a day in jail. It means that four young Black men had their lives taken or turned upside down after being falsely accused of a crime in Groveland, Florida. It means that right now, too many people in America, are sitting in jail without having yet been convicted of a crime but simply because they cannot afford bail. And it means that future presidents of the United States will remember that the United States Senate failed to hold Donald Trump accountable, and they will be emboldened to abuse their power knowing there will be no consequence. Donald Trump knows all this better than anybody. He may not acknowledge that we have two systems of justice, but he knows the institutions in this country , be it the courts or the Senate , are set up to protect powerful people like him. He told us as much, when regarding the sexual assault of women, he said, ""When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything."" He said that Article II of the United States Constitution gives him as president the right to do whatever he wants. Trump has shown us through his words and actions that he thinks he is above the law. And when the American people see the president acting as though he is above the law, it understandably leaves them feeling un-trustful of our system of justice, distrustful of our democracy. When the United States Senate refuses to hold him accountable, it reinforces that loss of trust in our system. Now, I'm under no illusion that this body is poised to hold this president accountable. But despite the conduct of the United States Senate in this impeachment trial, the American people must continue to strive toward the more perfect union that our Constitution promises. And it's going to take all of us, in every state, every town, everywhere to continue fighting for the best of who we are as a country. We each have an important role to play in fighting for those words inscribed on that United States Supreme Court: ""Equal Justice Under Law."" Frederick Douglass, who like many, I consider to be one of the founders of our nation, wrote that, ""the whole history of the progress of human liberty that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle."" The impeachment of Donald Trump has been one of those earnest struggles for liberty. In this fight, like so many before, it has been a fight against tyranny. This struggle has not been an easy one and it has left too many people across our nation feeling cynical. For too many people, this trial confirms something they've always known: that the real power in this country lies not with them, but with just a few people who advance their own interests at the expense of others' needs. For many, the injustice in this trial is yet another example of the way that our system of justice has worked, or, more accurately, failed to work. But here's the thing. Frederick Douglass also told us that, ""if there is no struggle, there is no progress."" He went on to say, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand."" And he said, ""It never did and it never will."" In order to wrestle power away from the few people at the very top who abuse their power, the American people are going to have to fight for the voice of the people and the power of the people. We must go into the darkness to shine a light, and we cannot be deterred, and we cannot be overwhelmed, and we cannot ever give up on our country. We cannot ever give up on the ideals that are the foundation for our system of democracy. We can never give up on the meaning of true justice, and it is part of our history, our past, clearly our present, and our future that in order to make these values real, in order to make the promise of our country real, we can never take it for granted. There will be moments in time and history where we experience incredible disappointment, but the greatest disappointment of all will be if we give up. We cannot ever give up fighting for who we know we are, and we must always see who we can be unburdened by who we have been. That is the strength of our nation. So, after the Senate votes today, Donald Trump will want the American people to feel cynical. He will want us not to care. He will want us to think that he is all powerful, and we have no power. But we're not going to let him get away with that. We're not going to give him what he wants. Because the true power and potential of the United States of America resides not with the president, but with the people. All the people. So in our long struggle for justice, I will do my part by voting to convict this lawless president and remove him from office. And I urge my colleagues to join me on the right side of history."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405384/harris-the-senate-trial-of-donald-trump-has-been-a-miscarriage-of-justice&speechType=6	Executive Branch Legislative Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-the-senate-trial-of-donald-trump-has-been-a-miscarriage-of-justice
VSKH62202052	Kamala Harris	2020-02-06	After Senate Intelligence Committee Releases Third Volume of Bipartisan Russia Report, Harris Renews Call for Elec ...	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday released the following statement after the Senate Intelligence Committee released the third volume of its report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""Today's bipartisan report clearly reiterates the fact that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and underscores the need for our nation's intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and lawmakers to work together to combat Russia's efforts to do so again in the 2020 election. Let's be clear: Russia's efforts to influence our elections are a threat to the integrity of our democracy. Everyone, regardless of party, should agree that we must do more to safeguard the security of our elections. ""The Committee's report identifies, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, the challenges our government faced in responding to Russian interference in the months leading up to the 2016 election. The report highlights valuable lessons learned from the United States' experience in 2016, what was done well and what could have been done better, to identify and counter the threat. ""The Committee's report shows the risks of compartmentation and limited congressional notification in formulating a timely response. It also shows that during the campaign, candidate Trump's public statements made an already difficult situation even worse. It is now incumbent on the current administration to learn the lessons identified in the report, and to implement policies to facilitate threat identification, timely attribution, information sharing, and clear, actionable, response options. ""As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am committed to holding the president and this administration accountable to their duty to protect our elections. Russia and other adversaries will target our elections again. We must be ready."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405386/after-senate-intelligence-committee-releases-third-volume-of-bipartisan-russia-report-harris-renews-call-for-election-security-measures-before-ahead-of-november&speechType=6	Executive Branch Legislative Branch		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/after-senate-intelligence-committee-releases-third-volume-of-bipartisan-russia-report-harris-renews-call-for-election-security-measures-before-ahead-of-november
VSKH112202050	Kamala Harris	2020-02-11	Harris, Colleagues Introduce Bill to Counter Safety Net Cuts Pushed By Trump Administration	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) joined Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and 8 of their colleagues in introducing the Allowing Steady Savings by Eliminating Tests, or ASSET, Act to eliminate asset limits as a means of eligibility for three vital public assistance programs and raise asset limits for a fourth program. The bill presents an alternative vision for vital public assistance programs. Rather than shredding the safety net by imposing new bureaucratic hurdles for families, as proposed by President Trump in his budget released this week, the ASSET Act would increase the financial security of low-income families by helping them save for the future and move towards self-sufficiency. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) help low-income families, particularly those with children, meet basic needs like food and heating. However, currently, these public assistance programs limit eligibility for benefits on the basis of not only income, but the assets of a family, such as savings and other resources. Asset limits for savings are outdated and often set as low as $1,000 or $2,000, limiting a family's preparedness for a medical emergency or unanticipated expense. The ASSET Act would eliminate these savings penalties, reducing administrative costs and resulting in a consistent policy across the country. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program reduces extreme poverty among the elderly and people with disabilities. While asset limits are part of the SSI program design, limits have not been raised or even adjusted for inflation since 1989. The ASSET Act raises SSI asset limits from $2,000 to $10,000 for an individual and $3,000 to $20,000 for a couple, and indexes those thresholds to inflation. ""Let's be clear, safety net programs should not punish people for saving money for unexpected expenses and medical emergencies,"" said Senator Harris. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that helps lift working families out of poverty by eliminating outdated restrictions. We should be doing everything we can to ensure Americans have access to these vital programs that help them thrive."" In addition to Senators Harris, Coons, and Brown, the ASSET Act is cosponsored by Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Bob Casey (D-PA). The bill is endorsed by Alliance to End Hunger, Bread for the World, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Children's HealthWatch, Coalition on Human Needs, Delaware Community Legal Aid Society, Delaware Community Reinvestment Action Council, Food Bank of Delaware, Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), First Focus Campaign for Children, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Women's Law Center, Prosperity Now, REACH Riverside, United Way of Delaware, and UnidosUS."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405399/harris-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-counter-safety-net-cuts-pushed-by-trump-administration&speechType=6	Unemployed and Low-Income Agriculture and Food Food Processing and Sales		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-bill-to-counter-safety-net-cuts-pushed-by-trump-administration
VSKH112202049	Kamala Harris	2020-02-11	Harris to Graham: Hold Immediate Hearing on Roger Stone Case and Make AG Barr Testify	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday sent a letter to Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) demanding that the committee hold a hearing, with Attorney General Bill Barr as a witness, on potential political interference in the sentencing of Roger Stone, President Trump's former campaign advisor and longtime friend. Harris' letter comes after reports that the Department of Justice was considering reducing the sentencing recommendation put forward by the career prosecutors overseeing Stone's case, all four of whom have since requested to withdraw from the case, and after the Department filed an updated sentencing recommendation in the case that contradicted the career prosecutors. ""The Justice Department's decision to overrule its career prosecutors, immediately after President Trump's tweet, calls into question the independence and integrity of our legal system,"" wrote Harris. ""As the committee responsible for oversight of the Justice Department, we must review these events and assess their impact on the integrity of the Department and our system of justice."" Harris continued, ""Failure to meet basic oversight responsibilities in the face of such alarming news would send a signal to this and future administrations that the Senate no longer conducts itself as a co-equal branch of government. Accordingly, I request that you immediately schedule a hearing for Attorney General William Barr to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee so that the committee and the American people can understand the Justice Department's decision to overrule its career prosecutors in this case."" February 11, 2020 The Honorable Lindsey O. Graham Chairman Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate 224 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Graham: On February 10, 2020, federal prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum recommending that Roger Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison after a jury convicted him of seven felonies for obstructing Congress, lying under oath to investigators, and interfering with witness testimony related to his efforts to learn about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On February 11, 2020, the morning after the sentencing memorandum was made public, President Trump criticized the recommended sentence on Twitter, saying ""This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!"" Just hours after President Trump's tweet, a senior Justice Department official announced that the Department planned to overrule its career prosecutors and reduce the sentence recommendation. After the decision was announced, all four career prosecutors who handled the case against Roger Stone withdrew from the case. One prosecutor resigned from the Justice Department altogether. The Justice Department's decision to overrule its career prosecutors, immediately after President Trump's tweet, calls into question the independence and integrity of our legal system. As the committee responsible for oversight of the Justice Department, we must review these events and assess their impact on the integrity of the Department and our system of justice. Failure to meet basic oversight responsibilities in the face of such alarming news would send a signal to this and future administrations that the Senate no longer conducts itself as a co-equal branch of government.

VSKH112202051	Kamala Harris	2020-02-11	Harris, Feinstein, Lawmakers Unveil Landmark Legislation to Break Free From Plastic Pollution	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) joined Senators Tom Udall (D-NM) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) in unveiling the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2020, legislation that would phase out unnecessary single-use plastic products, hold corporations accountable for wasteful products, reduce wasteful packaging, and reform our broken waste and recycling collection system. Recent reports estimate that each person consumes a credit card's worth of plastic per week. That's because plastic is everywhere and it doesn't biodegrade. Plastic breaks down into micro-plastics that are found in rainwater on the peaks of the Rocky Mountains, in farmland soil that produces our food, and in our lakes, rivers, and seas. Plastic production is also a major contributor to climate change, with its production expected to account for 20 percent of global oil consumption by 2050. Meanwhile, 92 percent of U.S. plastic waste is never recycled. By shifting the responsibility for recycling and cleanup to the companies that produce wasteful products, practical waste reduction and waste management policies can reverse this trend and put the United States on a path to break free from plastic pollution. ""There is simply no question we are facing a global environmental crisis from plastic pollution,"" said Senator Harris. ""The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act offers comprehensive action to reduce plastic waste and production, one of the major contributors to climate change and the poisoning of our oceans and waterways. California has been a leader on this issue and it is vital that we implement long lasting solutions at the federal level and hold corporations accountable for the plastic waste and pollution that poison our families and environment."" Along with Harris, Feinstein, Udall and Merkely the legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). The legislation joins initiatives from a number of countries around the world to reduce plastic pollution, such as policies from the 28 member countries of the European Union, Canada, India and China. The Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act will provide badly-needed national leadership , reducing the amount of wasteful plastic and reforming our broken waste and recycling collection system. It will shift the burden of cleanup to where it belongs , to the corporations that produce this waste: Require big corporations take responsibility for their pollution, requiring producers of plastic products to design, manage, and finance waste and recycling programs.Spur innovation, incentivizing big corporations to make reusable products and items that can actually be recycled.Create a nationwide beverage container refund program, which is successful at the state level.Reduce and ban certain single-use plastic products that are not recyclable.Establish minimum recycled content requirements for beverage containers, packaging, and food-service products, while standardizing recycling and composting labeling.Spur massive investments in U.S. domestic recycling and composting infrastructure, while pressing pause on new plastic facilities until critical environment and health protections are put in place."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405400/harris-feinstein-lawmakers-unveil-landmark-legislation-to-break-free-from-plastic-pollution&speechType=6	Environment		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-feinstein-lawmakers-unveil-landmark-legislation-to-break-free-from-plastic-pollution

Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Wednesday introduced the Protecting Unique and Beautiful Landscapes by Investing in California (PUBLIC) Lands Act, a package of three previously introduced bills that would increase protections and access for over 1 million acres of California lands, including nearly 600,000 acres of new wilderness and over 100,000 acres of new national monument. The bill introduction comes after the House of Representatives passed a large western public lands package that included the same increased protections for California lands. ""Every American should have the ability to explore and enjoy the outdoors, especially throughout California's beautiful natural scenery,"" said Harris. ""But this administration has threatened and chipped away at protections for our public lands, undermining our right to clear water and clean air. Rather than focusing on leasing our public lands to Big Oil, we should be focusing on protecting our future. I applaud the House of Representatives for taking decisive action to bolster protections for California's public lands, it is now time for the Senate to act."" ""Few places can match California's beauty, in part thanks to the success we've had protecting our rich natural resources. Our bill would build on that strong environmental legacy by safeguarding key portions of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Central Coast and Northern California's forests and rivers. Investing in public lands preservation not only benefits us now but will also continue to pay dividends for generations to come,"" said Feinstein. Throughout her Senate career, Harris has been a champion for the nation's public lands. Last year, she worked with Reps. Jared Huffman (CA-02), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), and Judy Chu (CA-27) to introduce a package of bills to establish new public lands protections throughout Northwest California, California's Central Coast, and the San Gabriel Mountain in Southern California. The PUBLIC Lands Act is a single bill that contains the three previously introduced bills. Harris has also led the fight for increasing access to the outdoors for underserved communities in our cities by introducing the Outdoors for All Act with Representative Barragan (CA-44). In 2018, her bill to expand the John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez, CA was signed into law. In 2019, her legislation to establish a national monument at the site of the St. Francis Dam disaster and to preserve and improve historic buildings and sites at Historically Black College and Universities was signed into law as part of the Natural Resources Management Act."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405406/harris-feinstein-applaud-house-passage-of-public-lands-bill-and-introduce-senate-companion-package&speechType=6	Environment		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-feinstein-applaud-house-passage-of-public-lands-bill-and-introduce-senate-companion-package

Harris (D-CA) and Congressman Joaquin Castro (TX-20) on Thursday introduced a resolution condemning the presence of white nationalist Stephen Miller in the White House and called for his immediate resignation from office. The resolution outlines Miller's consistent advocacy of racist and white supremacist ideology. Miller's work in the Administration has encouraged a resurgence of racism and bigotry and helped create a climate of fear, danger, and violence for communities of color and immigrants. ""Stephen Miller is the hateful force behind the cruel and xenophobic policies that have defined the Trump administration. His white supremacist, anti-immigrant ideology has no place in our country, let alone the White House,"" said Senator Harris. ""I'm proud to lead this effort on behalf of immigrant families in California and throughout the country."" ""It is unacceptable for the Trump Administration to knowingly install a known white nationalist and believer of white supremacist ideology in a position of power and influence over federal policy. Stephen Miller's presence in the Trump White House has allowed him to sow hate into federal policy, grind our immigration system to a halt, and encourage the President's own xenophobic beliefs,"" said Congressman Castro. ""Americans, and in particular the Latino community, will never forget it was President Trump and Stephen Miller's hateful rhetoric that helped inspire the deadly attack in El Paso where 22 individuals were killed for being Latino. When we see the families suffering at the border or being torn apart by ICE raids, we can look to Stephen Miller as the main architect of the Administration's cruel anti-immigrant policies. He must be removed from the White House immediately to stop further damage to our country and our communities."" ""From racist policies at the border to coddling white supremacists, this administration has stoked division and pitted our people against each other. Stephen Miller's record is one of hatred and cruelty. He has no place in the White House,"" said Senator Wyden.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and 6 of their colleagues in introducing legislation to greatly enhance the ability of law enforcement to investigate and solve gun crimes, crack down on gun trafficking and negligent gun dealers, and allow researchers, for the first time, to study gun violence and its impact on communities across the country. The Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act would require the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to collect, preserve and disclose gun records and gun tracing data. ""There is a national epidemic of gun violence; Congress needs to act,"" said Sen. Harris. ""Access to gun data is vital to law enforcement's ability to solve gun crimes and keep our communities safe.

Since 2003, Republicans have restricted the ability of the ATF and FBI to collect, preserve and make public a range of gun records and data by attaching so called ""Tiahrt Amendments"" to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) yearly funding bill. This legislation would repeal the following Tiahrt provisions: Ending the prohibition on the ATF from releasing firearm trace data for use by cities, states, researchers, litigants and members of the public;Ending the requirement for the FBI to destroy all approved gun purchaser records within 24 hours of approval; Ending the provision that makes it extremely difficult for ATF to retrieve firearms from prohibited persons who are mistakenly sold guns or from gun owners who become ineligible to possess guns; Ending the prohibition on ATF requiring gun dealers to submit their inventories to law enforcement; (Gun dealer inventories facilitate enforcement of the federal law requiring dealers to report the loss or theft of firearms and help law enforcement oversee the more than 50,000 firearms dealers nationwide. According to a 2008 analysis by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, more than 30,000 guns in the inventories of firearms dealers were unaccounted for in 2007.)Ending the prohibition on public disclosure of data on multiple handgun sales, as well as gun sales information dealers are required to keep that may be required to be reported to the U.S. Attorney General for determining the disposition of one or more firearms in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405414/harris-colleagues-introduce-gun-safety-bill-to-mandate-preservation-disclosure-of-federal-gun-data&speechType=6	Guns		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-gun-safety-bill-to-mandate-preservation-disclosure-of-federal-gun-data

""According to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General Complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the abuses include a CBP official slamming a woman who was six-months pregnant repeatedly into a fence and denial of medical care to at least three pregnant women in detention,"" the senators wrote. ""All three women described pleading with CBP personnel to be taken to a doctor or the ability to access clean clothes and unspoiled food. CBP personnel refused to take them seriously, with one reportedly responding: ""Don't be so dramatic.' As a result, at least one woman miscarried. We should not need to point out that this treatment is absolutely unacceptable."" The senators' letter follows a March 2019 hearing on the subject and CBP's subsequent, alarmingly contradictory answers. This includes the agency alleging they are unable to provide data on the documented instances of a CBP officer retraining or shackling a pregnant person because they do not ""have a mechanism in place for tracking this information"" while also claiming they are in compliance with regulations requiring such a mechanism. Along with Harris and Blumenthal, the letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Jeffrey A. Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Edward J. Markey (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Richard J. Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA). Dear Acting Commissioner Morgan: We have recently been made aware of extremely disturbing reports that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials are mistreating pregnant migrants in CBP custody. These reports, combined with public reporting that CBP is returning pregnant asylum seekers to Mexico in contravention even of the deeply-flawed Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), raises serious concerns for the health and safety of these individuals. We request your prompt response to the questions outlined in this letter. According to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General Complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the abuses include a CBP official slamming a woman who was six-months pregnant repeatedly into a fence and denial of medical care to at least three pregnant women in detention. All three women described pleading with CBP personnel to be taken to a doctor or the ability to access clean clothes and unspoiled food. CBP personnel refused to take them seriously, with one reportedly responding: ""Don't be so dramatic."" As a result, at least one woman miscarried. We should not need to point out that this treatment is absolutely unacceptable. These reports are especially infuriating in light of CBP's evasion of congressional oversight. In March 2019, in questions for the record submitted following an oversight hearing, Senator Blumenthal requested that CBP provide ""a list of every documented instance in the past two years of a CBP officer restraining or shackling a pregnant woman."" CBP responded that it ""cannot provide this data as the agency does not have a mechanism in place for tracking this information."" This response raises serious questions. First, in explaining CBP's opposition to a categorical ban on shackling pregnant individuals in detention, CBP stated that ""this action is exceedingly rare."" CBP cannot claim that shackling pregnant individuals is ""rare"" when it also claims that it does not keep records on those instances. How does CBP know how often this happens if it does not have a ""mechanism in place for tracking this information""? Indeed, public reporting indicates that shackling pregnant migrants ""around their hands, legs, and belly,"" especially while being transported between holding centers, may very well be a regular occurrence. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2020 prohibits the use of funds for placing restraints on women in DHS custody who are pregnant, absent an individualized determination that the woman is a serious flight risk or immediate and serious risk to herself or others. It is unclear how CBP can ensure compliance with this requirement without adequate records. Second, CBP claimed that it is in compliance with the 2015 National Standards on Transportation, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) policy, which, as CBP noted in its response, requires that all instances of restraining or shackling pregnant detainees ""must be documented in the appropriate electronic system(s) of record, including the facts and the reasoning behind the decision."" If CBP were in compliance with TEDS, then it would have records about each instance of shackling or restraining pregnant migrants in custody. Either CBP is not in compliance with TEDS or these records do exist. If the former, then we urge CBP to ensure that it complies with this policy as soon as possible. If the latter, we renew our request for records pertaining to each instance that CBP has used shackles or restraints on pregnant individuals. In light of reports that CBP personnel are mistreating pregnant people in detention, we are especially disturbed by the prospect that CBP is not complying with pre-existing obligations to monitor how it is treating pregnant people in its custody. Even in the absence of TEDS, we trust that CBP would want to be fully informed about how often it is restraining pregnant migrants. As you know, this practice can have tragic consequences. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has long warned that use of restraints can ""put the health of the [pregnant person] and fetus at risk"" by increasing the chances of developing blood clots, interfering with the ability of medical professionals to treat preeclampsia and other potentially fatal complications, and preventing pregnant individuals from being able to break their falls. Indeed, up until 2017, it was CBP policy to never detain pregnant individuals barring exceptional circumstances. Since the Trump administration's decision to reverse that policy, the rate of miscarriages reported in CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody has nearly doubled. Given the medical consensus that shackling ""not only compromise[s] health care but is demeaning and rarely necessary,"" there should be no reason that CBP is using the practice except in exceedingly rare circumstances and we hope that CBP is, in fact, currently keeping records on each instance of shackling or restraining pregnant migrants in its custody. If not, we urge you to do so as quickly as possible. We request answers to the following questions no later than February 28, 2020: Does CBP keep records of each instance of shackling a pregnant individual in detention, as required by TEDS? If not, why not?If CBP does not keep those records, has CBP conducted an analysis of how that practice is consistent with TEDS? If so, please provide that analysis.If CBP does keep those records, please provide them.Does CBP keep records on the rates of miscarriages and other pregnancy-related complications that CBP detainees experience in or as a result of CBP custody? If not, why not? If yes, please provide those records.Does CBP keep records of complaints by pregnant detainees about mistreatment by CBP personnel? If not, will you commit to doing so?How does the agency hold CBP officers who mistreat detainees in their custody accountable?How many CBP employees have been disciplined for mistreating pregnant detainees in the last three years? How many CBP employees have been fired for mistreating pregnant detainees in the last three years?Is CBP in compliance with requirements to make individualized determinations any time a pregnant detainee is placed in restraints?What guidance or training exists for CBP personnel with respect to applying MPP to pregnant individuals? Please provide documentation of any such guidance or training.Has CBP entered pregnant individuals into the MPP program? If so, how many?Thank you for your attention to this important matter. If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Schwartz in Sen. Blumenthal's office (Charlotte_Schwartz@blumenthal.senate.gov).

VSKH202202044	Kamala Harris	2020-02-20	Harris, Colleagues Push Departments of Education and Labor to Withdraw Rules Allowing for Federally Sanctioned Dis ...	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and their colleagues in urging the Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to withdraw proposed rules that would expand federally funded discrimination against members of the LGBTQIA+ community and women. The lawmakers sent two separate letters to the Department of Education and the Department of Labor. Both rules would eliminate crucial protections that would leave eligible people at risk of losing access to vital taxpayer services, from college readiness programs at the Department of Education to job training programs at the Department of Labor , simply because of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The proposed rules are part of the Trump Administration's roll-out of similar proposed rules that would allow for federally sanctioned discrimination at six other federal agencies. ""The administration's proposal opens the door to federally funded discrimination against women and members of the LGBTQIA+ community and would hurt some of our nation's most vulnerable groups. These rules are nothing more than an attack on Americans simply because of who they are. I will continue to fight against discriminatory policies and ensure protection for the communities that need it most,"" said. Senator Harris. Both rules would expand federally funded discrimination by eliminating requirements to alert beneficiaries of their rights; eliminating requirements to refer beneficiaries to alternate providers in cases where beneficiaries may feel uncomfortable with the religious belief of the provider; and explicitly allowing federally funded service providers to include mandatory religious elements as part of their services. The rules also greenlight employment discrimination by allowing federally funded service providers to make employment decisions based on ""acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization,"" allowing people to be hired or fired on the basis of their sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy status. In the letter to Secretary DeVos, the senators outlined how these rules could prevent students from accessing vital services that provide healthcare screenings, transportation, shelter, clothing, new immigrant services, and more. Under the proposed regulations, service providers could subject LGBTQIA+ students to anti-LGBTQIA+ hostility or force them to participate in religious activities against their beliefs. Additionally, the Department of Education rule expands religious exemptions for educational institutions and student organizations, giving them license to discriminate against members of the LGBTQIA+ community and women. ""LGBTQIA+ students often feel unsafe during their first year on college campuses,"" the senators wrote to Secretary DeVos. ""By creating carve-outs for religious educational institutions to avoid creating equitable environments for LGBTQIA+ students and women, the Department is effectively encouraging institutions to turn away from their legal obligations to serve all students."" In the letter to Secretary Scalia, the senators highlighted how the rule would create barriers to services like job training programs for members of the LGBTQIA+ community and women and make existing forms of workplace harassment and discrimination against those communities worse. ""We are deeply concerned that by expanding religious exemptions, the Administration's proposed rule would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate against employees because of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity,"" wrote the senators in the letter to Secretary Scalia. ""This proposed rule will exacerbate ongoing forms of discrimination and harassment against the LGBTQIA+ community."" In addition to Senators Harris and Murray, other senators who signed the letter to Secretary Scalia include Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). In addition to Senators Harris Murray, other senators who signed the letter to Secretary DeVos include Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Jack Reed (D-RI). The full text of the letter to the Department of Education is below and HERE. February 19, 2020 The Honorable Betsy DeVos Secretary of Education U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202 Dear Secretary DeVos: We write to strongly oppose the U.S Department of Education's (the Department) proposed regulation, ""Uniform Administrative Requirements, Costs Principles, Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, Direct Grant Programs, State-Administered Formula Grant Programs, Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program, and Strengthening Institutions Program,"" which was published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2020. The proposed regulation, developed under the guise of religious liberty, is actually an attack on religious freedom and would open the door to federally-funded discrimination. The proposed rule drastically expands religious exemptions that could provide federally-funded faith-based institutions and student organizations a license to discriminate against students, employees, and beneficiaries who are LGBTQIA+, as well as women. In addition, it would lift protections designed to ensure beneficiaries of programs funded by the Department are not forced to participate in a religion not their own. We demand the Department immediately withdraw this proposed rule. 1. The Proposed Rule Undermines Title IX The proposed rule would grant a significant expansion of the limited exemption for education institutions in Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (Title IX). Title IX creates an exemption for educational institutions ""controlled by a religious organization."" In the proposed rule, the Department proposes the Office of Civil Rights use a series of seven factors to evaluate requests from educational institutions for a religious exemption. Several of these factors are overbroad, including: a statement that the educational institution subscribes to specific moral beliefs or practices, and a statement that members of the institution community may be subjected to discipline for violating those beliefs or practices; a statement that is approved by the governing body of an educational institution and that includes, refers to, or is predicated upon religious tenets, beliefs, or teachings; or other evidence establishing that an educational institution is controlled. The Department's proposed factors are so broad that religious exemptions could be given not just to educational institutions controlled by religious institutions, as is provided for by the statute, but also colleges and universities with a tenuous relationship to religion. Enforcing the proposed factors as written would allow virtually any college or university to claim an exemption. If an educational institution simply subscribes to a certain set of ""moral beliefs or practices,"" even if those beliefs and practices have no connection with religion, and ""members of the institution may be subjected to discipline for violating those beliefs,"" the college or university could claim an exemption. Similarly, educational institutions that submit a statement ""predicated upon religious tenets, beliefs, or teachings,"" or statements based on ""other evidence"" that do not even mention religion, could establish other harmful carve-outs to non-discrimination laws. The Department should not propose a regulation that is contrary to the statutory language of Title IX and would provide colleges and universities with a blanket license to discriminate at the expense of students. 2. The Proposed Rule Fails to Protect Students from Discrimination We are deeply concerned that expanding the religious exemption for educational institutions controlled by religious organizations would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate against employees and beneficiaries because of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The proposed rule would allow employers to make decisions based on the ""acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization,"" which is an expansion of the religious exemption rule under Title VII. This means individuals could be fired or not provided resources on the basis of their sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, all based on an organization's self-defined religious tenets. Accordingly, the proposed rule effectively allows entities that receive federal support to discriminate. This is particularly discouraging given the high rates of discrimination and barriers faced by women and LGBTQIA+ students on college campuses. LGBTQIA+ students often feel unsafe during their first year on college campuses. According to a survey taken in 2019 of first-year students, 38 percent of first-year LGBQ students felt unsafe compared to 22 percent of their heterosexual classmates. Around 52 percent of transgender students felt unsafe compared to 23 percent their non-transgender classmates. The survey also found 24 percent of LGBQ students reported being verbally threatened between 2018 and 2019 compared to 16 percent of their heterosexual classmates. Twenty-six percent of transgender students reported being verbally threatened between 2018 and 2019 compared to 17 percent of non-transgender students. Women also face a number of additional barriers to equity and inclusion at school. While Title IX has made it easier for women to participate in education programs, discrimination and harassment still make it harder for women seeking to get an education. Studies have shown women are less likely to enter fields of study that are perceived to discriminate against women, and in a recent campus climate survey, over one quarter of undergraduate women reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact during college. Among students enrolled in a community college, two-thirds of women who have children after they enroll do not end up finishing their degree. By creating carve-outs for religious educational institutions to avoid creating equitable environments for LGBTQIA+ students and women, the Department is effectively encouraging institutions to turn away from their legal obligations to serve all students. Rather than expand the ability of colleges and universities to discriminate against women and LGBTQIA+ students, the Department should encourage and work with religious educational institutions to combat discrimination, while also preserving their faith-based educational missions. 3. The Proposed Language Undermines Institutions' Ability to Enforce Non-Discrimination Protections The proposed rule prevents educational institutions from ensuring that religious student groups are subject to the same expectations of inclusivity and non-discrimination as other student groups on their campus. Some colleges and universities across the country have sought to ensure students are not required to fund student groups that actively discriminate against them. For example, these schools have determined that student groups funded with activity fees should not have restrictive membership requirements that would prevent students from joining because of the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, religion, or other factors. The proposed rule undermines this goal by requiring that ""[a] public institution shall not deny to a religious student organization at the public institution any right, benefit, or privilege that is otherwise afforded to other student organizations at the public institution (including full access to the facilities of the public institution and official recognition of the organization by the public institution) because of the beliefs, practices, policies, speech, membership standards, or leadership standards of the religious student organization."" On its face, this language would require LGBTQIA+ students, women, and educational institutions to continue to support and fund religious student organizations that refuse to allow LGBTQIA+ students or women who access reproductive health care to become members. Such a proposal flies in the face of the Supreme Court case Christian Legal Society v. Martinez in which the Court affirmed the right of public universities to require student clubs seeking official recognition and funding to be open to all registered students. In affirming this right, the Court rejected the student organization's claim that it could restrict the membership of LGBTQIA+ students. 4. The Proposed Rule Eliminates Requirements to Protect the Religious Liberty of Beneficiaries The proposed rule eliminates the requirement that religious providers receiving direct grant program funding from the Department must explain peoples' religious liberty and other rights in writing. Currently, these religious providers must provide prior written notice to any beneficiaries of their Department, funded programs explaining they are not required to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) or participate in activities that are voluntary. Similarly, the proposed regulation eliminates protections for people who may be uncomfortable or unable to receive services from religious providers, implicating the religious liberty of these beneficiaries. In the Department's existing regulation, if a beneficiary objects to the religious nature of an organization, ""that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection."" The Department's proposal abandons the referral requirement and provides no substitute to protect beneficiaries' ability to go to a non-religious provider. Eliminating these requirements from the current rule will create unnecessary, harmful barriers for beneficiaries seeking access to important services. For example, a student who identifies as LGBTQIA+ or who is a child of LGBTQIA+ parents could experience open anti-LGBTQIA+ hostility from a Department-funded program partnering with their public school to provide healthcare screening, transportation, shelter, clothing, or new immigrant services. Additionally, a low-income LGBTQIA+ student participating in an Upward Bound program for college readiness preparation could be forced to participate in additional religious activities against their personal beliefs. The Obama administration promulgated this rule, in part, to ensure those seeking aid from federally-funded programs in the Department could be aware of their religious liberty rights and not experience taxpayer-funded discrimination. No one should have to choose between their beliefs and accessing the services they need. We urge you to withdraw this proposed rule. Sincerely, February 19, 2020 The Honorable Eugene Scalia Secretary of Labor U.S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Ave. NW Washington, DC 20210 Dear Secretary Scalia: We write to strongly oppose the Department of Labor's (DOL or the Department) proposed regulation, ""Equal Participation of Faith-Based Organizations in the Department of Labor's Programs and Activities: Implementation of Executive Order 13831,"" which was published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2020. The proposed regulation, developed under the guise of religious liberty, is actually an attack on religious freedom that would open the door to federally-funded discrimination. The proposed rule drastically expands religious exemptions that could provide organizations that receive federal funds a license to discriminate against employees and beneficiaries who are LGBTQIA+ and women, and lifts protections designed to insure beneficiaries are not forced to participate in a religion not their own. We demand the Department immediately withdraw this proposed rule. 1. The Proposed Rule Would Allow Religious Organizations to Use Federal Funding to Discriminate Against Beneficiaries We are deeply concerned that by expanding religious exemptions, the Administration's proposed rule would allow faith-based organizations to discriminate against employees because of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The proposed rule would allow faith-based entities to make employment decisions on the ""basis of [their employees'] acceptance to or adherence to the religious requirements or standards of the organization, but not on the basis of any other protected characteristic."" There appear to be no guardrails to ensure faith-based providers receiving taxpayer funds do not use religion as a pretext to discriminate when making employment decisions. This proposed rule will exacerbate ongoing forms of discrimination and harassment against the LGBTQIA+ community. In a 2017 nationally representative survey reporting harassment in the LGBTQ community, 20 percent of LGBTQ people said they were discriminated against when applying for jobs. In the same survey, nearly 60 percent of LGBTQ people agreed with the statement, ""LGBTQ people where I live have fewer employment opportunities."" In a March 2018 report on LGBTQ poverty and economic justice, between 15 percent and 43 percent of LGBTQ workers reported having experienced discrimination on the job. In the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 30 percent of survey respondents who had a job the previous year reported being fired, were denied a promotion, or experienced some form of mistreatment. The proposed rule will make it easier for employers to discriminate against women and pregnant workers. Women already face significant discrimination in the workplace, which this rule would further embolden. In a 2017 survey, approximately four out of ten women reported facing discrimination in the workplace. Historically, some of this discrimination has resulted from women exercising reproductive health decisions. For example, pregnancy discrimination cases filed with the EEOC have risen substantially over recent decades, while a 2014 survey estimates nearly a quarter million women are denied requests for accommodations related to pregnancy each year. Some employers have threatened to fire employees for using contraception, while others have fired workers for being unmarried and pregnant, or for having an abortion. The proposed rule could allow faith-based entities to exacerbate existing challenges facing women and discriminate against those employees who do not share the same beliefs of the employer. 2. The Proposed Rule Eliminates Requirements to Protect Religious Liberty for Beneficiaries The proposed regulation also eliminates protections for people who may be uncomfortable or unable to receive services from religious providers, implicating the religious liberty of those beneficiaries. In the existing Department regulation, if someone who is seeking services objects to the religious character of an organization that provides services under the program, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or the prospective beneficiary has no objection."" The Department's proposal abandons the referral requirement and provides no substitute to protect beneficiaries' ability to go to a non-religious provider. The current referral requirement stems from the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (the Council), which President Obama initiated to strengthen and assess the relationships among faith-based entities, community-serving organizations, and the government. The Council members believed the referral requirement was critical to providing adequate protection for the ""fundamental religious liberty rights of social service beneficiaries."" The Department offers no reasonable explanation for its decision to abandon this careful, consensus-based effort by a diverse group of grassroots leaders and other religious experts to protect religious liberty. Similarly, the proposed rule eliminates the requirement that religious providers receiving taxpayer funding must explain peoples' religious liberty and other rights in writing. Currently, religious providers must provide prior written notice to a beneficiary explaining they are not required to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) or activities that are voluntary. The notice also makes clear they can report suspected violations to the DOL's Civil Rights Center. The proposed rule eliminates this notice requirement. People cannot exercise their rights if they have no understanding of the scope and nature of those rights. Eliminating the requirement risks exposing beneficiaries to, and leaving them unable to effectively object to, discrimination or religious coercion from a provider. These protections are vital to ensuring people never have to make the decision between accessing services, often critical, and retaining their religious freedom. Eliminating notice of these protections unfairly elevates the interests of entities over the needs and rights of people seeking vital services.

The White House has yet to inform the American public of an adequate plan to address this global health crisis. California has been at the frontlines in responding to the coronavirus outbreak and has received insufficient guidance and assistance from the administration. ""The surge of outbreaks in other nations across the globe, from South Korea to Iran to Italy, only heightens the need for public hearings. [ ] The American people need to hear directly from the officials who are responsible for responding to and containing the virus, not from reports of closed-door meetings and tweets,"" Harris wrote. She continued, ""We cannot afford to continue to wait for a credible, comprehensive plan to address the crisis. Your administration's propensity to minimize its challenges, combined with its longstanding refusal to participate in adequate oversight, is now threatening our nation's public health."" The full letter is available here and below. February 26, 2020 President Donald J. Trump The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: I write to express my deep concern about your administration's response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the United States over a month ago, your administration has failed to take necessary steps to address this crisis and provide adequate information to Congress and the American people, raising serious questions about your administration's ability to prepare for and contain COVID-19. You have stated that the virus is ""very well under control in our country"" and that you ""think the whole situation will start working out."" Your National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has also minimized the ongoing threat of COVID-19 spread, stating ""We have contained this...it's pretty close to airtight"" Mr. President, denying the seriousness of this public health crisis will not keep Americans safe. You must act and, to date, you have not done nearly enough. To start, the American people deserve to hear from administration leaders about plans to address this global public health crisis. For weeks, I have been calling for public hearings in the Senate with senior officials from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State. Almost six weeks after this crisis began, Congress is finally getting our first opportunity to question administration officials about COVID-19 in public hearings. This delay is simply unacceptable. The surge of outbreaks in other nations across the globe, from South Korea to Iran to Italy, only heightens the need for public hearings. The World Health Organization appears ready to upgrade the outbreak to a pandemic. Your own public health officials said yesterday that it is not a question of ""if"" COVID-19 will spread through the United States, but ""when [it] will happen and how many people will have severe illness."" The American people need to hear directly from the officials who are responsible for responding to and containing the virus, not from reports of closed-door meetings and tweets. More than any other state, California has been on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. California communities are stepping up to respond to this outbreak, screening and testing incoming travelers, hosting over 800 repatriated and quarantined individuals, and caring for those recovering from the virus, despite poor coordination and vague guidance from the federal government. Further, your administration has yet to reimburse state and local entities for costs incurred as part of the federal response to COVID-19 , or even provided written assurances of any plan to do so. Your emergency supplemental appropriations request from February 24, 2020 did not address my concerns regarding your administration's strategy to prevent further spread of the virus in the United States. In addition to being far smaller than previous emergency supplemental requests and falling short of recommendations from public health experts, your request also relies on raiding public health funding from other critical priorities. In addition, your Fiscal Year 2021 budget request that would cut funding for programs critical to response efforts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. And your Secretary of Health and Human Services has already admitted that the United States only has 10 percent of the protective facemasks needed for U.S. health care workers. All of this will further weaken the United States' ability to address this crisis and prevent American lives from being lost. We cannot afford to continue to wait for a credible, comprehensive plan to address the crisis. Your administration's propensity to minimize its challenges, combined with its longstanding refusal to participate in adequate oversight, is now threatening our nation's public health. At a minimum, your administration must: Correct problems with COVID-19 diagnostic test kits and make them available to hospitals and public health labs in all states.Take all necessary steps to guarantee the adequate supply of protective facemasks for U.S. health care workers and the American public, including to produce them domestically.Ensure greater transparency and better coordination with state and local entities, including by appointing a single federal official responsible for COVID-19 response.Immediately reimburse state and local entities for costs already incurred in responding to the virus.Make funds available to state and local entities now for ongoing and future response efforts so that they are not forced to rely on delayed federal reimbursement.Commit administration officials to fully cooperate with Congress, including routine public testimony at Congressional hearings, timely responses to requests for information, and responses to oversight inquiries.Thank you for your attention to this issue. I look forward to your timely response.

VSKH272202041	Kamala Harris	2020-02-27	Amid Apparent Pattern of Political Influence at DOJ, Harris Leads Judiciary Dems in Call for Investigation	statement	"U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Thursday led Judiciary Democrats in a letter to U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz demanding an investigation into a series of actions taken by the DOJ that appear to benefit the president's personal or political interests. Specifically, the letter points to Attorney General Barr and other political appointees overruling the sentencing recommendation made by career prosecutors in the case of Roger Stone, a top advisor to the president. Further, the letter points to Barr reportedly intervening in the case of President Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn by appointing an outside prosecutor to scrutinize the work of career prosecutors. The letter includes an appendix of additional actions that suggest a pattern of political interference at DOJ. ""The public record provides a number of reasons to believe that President Trump or other White House officials are seeking to influence the Justice Department's handling of certain investigations, civil lawsuits, and criminal prosecutions,"" the senators wrote. They continued, ""Our concern is that politically motivated enforcement of federal law could become standard practice. This would permanently damage the integrity and independence of the Justice Department."" In addition to Harris, the letter is signed by every Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee member: Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), and Cory Booker (D-NJ).

The Department's mission to ""ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans"" requires that its prosecutorial decisions be insulated from political influence, including interference from the White House. Yet when Attorney General Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 1, 2019, he did not provide a clear answer when Senator Harris asked whether he had received or acted upon requests or suggestions from President Trump or the White House to open specific investigations. The public record provides a number of reasons to believe that President Trump or other White House officials are seeking to influence the Justice Department's handling of certain investigations, civil lawsuits, and criminal prosecutions. For example: · Attorney General Barr and other political appointees overruled the sentencing recommendation made by career prosecutors in the Roger Stone case. This caused all four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case, with one resigning from the Department. · The Attorney General reportedly assigned an outside prosecutor to scrutinize career prosecutors' handling of the case against Michael Flynn, President Trump's former National Security Adviser. The President has repeatedly called Flynn's prosecution ""unfair."" · Former U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu reportedly pursued a case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe even after a team of career prosecutors concluded they could not win a conviction. According to recent reports, the replacement of Liu with a new U.S. Attorney was related to her failure to indict McCabe, a frequent target of the President's ""deep state allegations."" These actions, along with those detailed in the attached appendix, suggest political interference in the Justice Department's work. A number of Justice Department policies and regulations exist to prevent this from happening. Our concern is that politically motivated enforcement of federal law could become standard practice. This would permanently damage the integrity and independence of the Justice Department. We therefore request that your office investigate whether these incidents are indicative of a pattern of abuse or misconduct in Department programs, or by Department employees. Sincerely, APPENDIX President Trump's efforts to investigate his political rival, Hillary Clinton. Volume II of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election detailed three separate occasions on which President Trump asked or suggested that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions investigate the president's former opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Special Counsel's report also described a series of tweets in which the president suggested or openly called for criminal investigations into Clinton. In November 2017, Sessions tasked U.S. Attorney John Huber with investigating allegations by Trump and his allies that the FBI had not adequately pursued investigations into the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One. The investigation reportedly concluded with no charges after Huber ""found nothing worth pursuing."" Prior to his confirmation, Attorney General William Barr claimed that there was a stronger predicate for investigating the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One than there was for investigating the Trump campaign's ties with Russia, although he was unable to detail that predicate during his confirmation hearing, instead referring to ""smoke around the issue."" The Office of the Inspector General recently completed an exhaustive investigation into whether the Crossfire Hurricane investigation had an adequate factual and legal predicate, and should similarly evaluate whether the Huber investigation was adequately predicated. President Trump's efforts to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. As documented in a rough transcript of a phone call released by the White House, on July 25, 2019, President Trump not only attempted to coerce the newly-elected president of Ukraine into assisting with investigations into his political rival, a scheme orchestrated by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, but President Trump also suggested that he would work through the Justice Department and instruct Attorney General Barr to follow up with Ukrainian officials about the investigations. Despite receiving a criminal referral from the CIA General Counsel and the National Security Council's top lawyer, the Department quickly concluded ""there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted."" A Justice Department spokesperson later denied that the attorney general had knowledge of or spoke to the president about the July 25 call, but public reports subsequently established that he did in fact meet with individuals involved in the Ukraine scheme. In August 2019, Attorney General Barr met with two lawyers who, working with Giuliani, had reportedly offered to ""fix"" federal criminal investigations of Ukrainian oligarchs in exchange for the oligarchs' assistance in digging up dirt on President Trump's political rivals. The outcome of that meeting remains unknown. Efforts to exonerate President Trump's political allies. · It appears that President Trump's personal and political interests influenced the Justice Department's sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to President Trump. On February 10, 2020, career prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum recommending that Stone be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison after a jury convicted him of seven felonies for obstructing Congress, lying under oath to investigators, and interfering with witness testimony related to his efforts to learn about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On February 11, 2020, the morning after the sentencing memorandum was filed, President Trump criticized the proposed sentence on Twitter, saying ""This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!"" Just hours after President Trump's disapproving tweet, a senior Justice Department official announced that the Department planned to overrule its career prosecutors and reduce the sentence recommendation. After the decision was announced, four career prosecutors who handled the case against Roger Stone withdrew from the case, and one resigned from the Department altogether. · According to recent reports, Attorney General Barr has also intervened in the case against President Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whose prosecution Trump has repeatedly criticized as ""unfair."" Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI but moved to withdraw his guilty plea in January 2020. On January 7, 2020, prosecutors filed a memorandum recommending a prison sentence between zero and six months. The Department weakened that recommendation in a new filing on January 29, which indicated that a sentence of probation would be ""reasonable."" Earlier this month, it was reported that Barr had assigned U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Jeff Jensen to review the handling of Flynn's case, which was prosecuted by career attorneys on the Special Counsel's team and in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Rudy Giuliani wields undue influence over the actions of the Justice Department. · Giuliani peddles his influence at the Justice Department as leverage in his smear campaign against President Trump's political rival, Joe Biden. As documented in a rough transcript of a phone call released by the White House, on July 25, 2019, President Trump attempted to coerce the newly-elected president of Ukraine into assisting with investigations into his political rival, a scheme orchestrated by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. In August 2019, Attorney General Barr met with two lawyers who, working with Giuliani, had reportedly offered to ""fix"" federal criminal investigations of Ukrainian oligarchs in exchange for the oligarchs' assistance in digging up dirt on President Trump's political rivals. The outcome of that meeting remains unknown. · Giuliani provides Ukrainian propaganda and misinformation to the Justice Department. On February 11, 2020, Attorney General Barr confirmed a claim made by Senator Lindsey Graham that the Justice Department has ""created a process that Rudy could give information [about President Trump's desired investigation into former Vice President Biden and his son Hunter Biden] and they would see if it's verified."" A Justice Department official later confirmed that Giuliani, who is currently being investigated in the Southern District of New York, had ""recently"" shared information obtained from multiple Ukrainian officials related to former Vice President Joe Biden and his family through this ""process."" · President Trump pressures the Justice Department to drop cases against Giuliani's clients. Reports suggest that efforts by allies of the president to influence federal criminal investigations are not limited to Ukraine. For example, it was reported that, during a 2017 Oval Office meeting with President Trump and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Giuliani sought to secure the release of his jailed client, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader named Reza Zarrab, as part of a potential prisoner swap with Turkey. According to reports, President Trump urged Tillerson to pressure the Justice Department to drop its case against Giuliani's client. Improper communications between the Justice Department and the White House. President Trump has not acted alone in improperly suggesting that the Justice Department be used to settle his personal and political scores. During Matthew Whitaker's tenure as Chief of Staff to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he reportedly ""frequently spoke by phone with both [President] Trump and Chief of Staff John Kelly"" and ""privately provided advice to the president . . . on how the White House might be able to pressure the Justice Department to investigate the president's political adversaries."" Mr. Whitaker was reportedly ""seen by Department officials as a partisan and a White House spy"" who was ""counseling the White House on how the President and his aides might successfully pressure Sessions and [former Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein to give in to Trump's demands."" Targeting states that use their sovereign powers to minimize the damage of President Trump's regressive policies and positions.President Trump has repeatedly expressed an animus toward the state of California, and that animus appears to have played a role in the Department's decisions to challenge the state's carbon-cutting pact with Quebec and open an antitrust inquiry into a deal California made with four automakers to reduce carbon emissions. Targeting companies that President Trump dislikes. President Trump has repeatedly expressed his disdain for CNN, and in late summer 2017, President Trump reportedly ordered then-director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn to pressure the Justice Department to intervene in AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN. The Department later filed suit to block the merger. The Office of Legal Counsel's use of its power and status to insulate President Trump from accusations of wrongdoing. Over the past three years, OLC has provided questionable legal justifications and political cover for some of the Trump Administration's most controversial and politically fraught actions. · The Whistleblower: On September 24, 2019, OLC issued a memorandum that overruled a decision made by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (""ICIG"") that a whistleblower complaint outlining President Trump's misconduct was not an ""urgent concern"" as defined in the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, 50 U.S.C. § 3033(k)(5)(G). The complaint outlined President Trump's attempt to pressure the newly-elected president of Ukraine to announce investigations into President Trump's political rival and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, serious accusations that ultimately resulted in President Trump's impeachment. After OLC overruled the ICIG, the whistleblower complaint was referred to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice for ""appropriate review."" The OLC memorandum and subsequent actions taken by the Department of Justice were resoundingly criticized by dozens of Inspectors General, including yourself. You, and your fellow inspectors general, wrote, ""OLC substituted its judgement and reversed a determination the statute specifically entrusted to the ICIG"" and that the opinion was ""wrong as a matter of law and policy."" · President Trump's So-Called Border Wall: OLC bowed to political pressure to legitimize President Trump's decision to invoke a national emergency to secure funding for a border wall. Despite the fact that OLC lawyers were ""frustrated"" and ""skeptical"" of the decision, OLC ""ultimately gave its blessing, people familiar with the matter said."" · President Trump's Tax Returns: OLC again bowed to political pressure when it provided a legal justification for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's refusal to produce President Trump's tax returns, despite a contrary legal opinion issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and cautioned the judicial branch that intervention in the dispute would be inappropriate. · Online Gambling: In January 2019, bowing to political pressure and political donors, OLC released an opinion that restricted online gambling. The opinion appears to have been influenced in part by Sheldon Adelson, a casino owner and political donor who spent millions of dollars to elect President Trump."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405442/amid-apparent-pattern-of-political-influence-at-doj-harris-leads-judiciary-dems-in-call-for-investigation&speechType=6	Executive Branch Judicial Branch Legislative Branch		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/amid-apparent-pattern-of-political-influence-at-doj-harris-leads-judiciary-dems-in-call-for-investigation
VSKH272202042	Kamala Harris	2020-02-27	Harris, Colleagues Blast Facebook's Continued Failure to Monitor and Enforce Gun Sales Ban	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday joined Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Ed Markey (D-MA) and 10 of their Senate colleagues in calling out Facebook for its continued failure to enforce and monitor its own ban on guns sales, pointing to a recent report that shows sellers and buyers have simply moved their transactions to private Facebook groups in order circumvent the social media giant's own ban. ""[D]espite Facebook's ban of gun sales on its platforms, users are nonetheless able to facilitate firearm transactions in private Facebook groups specifically designed to skirt Facebook's ban on firearm sales,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The senators cited a recent Protocol report detailing Facebook's failed efforts to track and remove gun sellers who simply move to new private groups when the company shuts them down. The report quotes a former Facebook employee who claims the company sought to get the content down to an ""acceptable"" level after it recognized it was too difficult to enforce its own gun sales ban due to the ""sheer volume"" of the content on its platform. ""While we understand that in November 2018 Facebook instituted proactive measures to better identify accounts that violate its gun sale policy, we have concerns that those measures fall short,"" the Senators added. The senators demanded Zuckerberg answer specific questions to how many private group and individual user accounts Facebook suspends each month for violating the firearm sale policy, and what proactive measures it is taking to ensure that users in private groups are not able to skirt Facebook's ban on gun sales. Additionally, the senators want to know what procedures Facebook has in place to stop permanently suspended users and groups from starting a new group or hop to other platforms like WhatsApp or Snapchat to sell guns, and report instances of gun trafficking to appropriate law enforcement. Along with Harris, Menendez, and Markey, the letter was also signed by Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Patty Murray (D-WA), Dick Durbin (D-IL) Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: We write to express concern that despite Facebook's ban of gun sales on its platforms, users are nonetheless able to facilitate firearm transactions in private Facebook groups specifically designed to skirt Facebook's ban on firearm sales. In light of troubling reporting, we request information on the steps Facebook is taking to combat gun sales facilitated through private Facebook groups. When Facebook banned the sales of firearms on its platforms in 2016, your company took a powerful stand against unlicensed gun sales. A 2017 study estimated that 22 percent of firearm owners obtained their most recent firearm without undergoing a background check. Another study found that the private market for gun sales ""has long been recognized as a leading source of guns used in crimes."" As an industry leader, Facebook ""shut down a key avenue that criminals and minors [ ] used to arm themselves and put lives in danger"". This is exactly the type of common sense gun policy that enjoys broad support with the American public. Unfortunately, it is not enough to simply ban such sales. Effective monitoring, including the suspension of accounts in violation of these policies, is essential. As reported in Protocol earlier this month, ""[w]hile Facebook's policy led to the removal of some high-profile groups that hosted these discussions, many simply moved to unlisted settings that made tracking the behavior more difficult."" Even more troubling is the assertion from a former Facebook engineer that the ""sheer volume of content"" made it difficult to enforce the firearm sales ban, and Facebook simply sought to ""get [the content] down to a level that was acceptable."" While we understand that in November 2018 Facebook instituted proactive measures to better identify accounts that violate its gun sale policy , we have concerns that those measures fall short. Thus, we request answers to the following questions no later than March 12, 2020: On average, how many private group accounts does Facebook suspend each month for violating the firearm sale policy?On average, how many users within private groups does Facebook suspend each month for violating the firearm sale policy?What measures does Facebook have in place to ensure that if it permanently suspends a private group for violating the gun sale policy, users from that group cannot create another private group under a different name?What proactive measures is Facebook taking to ensure that users in private groups are not able to skirt Facebook's ban on gun sales, including by referring potential buyers to apps such as WhatsApp, Snapchat, Wickr, or any alternative communication platform?What policies does Facebook have in place to alert law enforcement to instances of gun trafficking on its platforms? Specifically, in those states where peer-to-peer sales without a federal firearm licensor are illegal, does Facebook refer such attempted sales to state and local law enforcement?Facebook claims that over 93% of the firearm sales content removed from its platform is done proactively. Thus Facebook relies on user reports to make up the difference. How does Facebook expect users to report on violations within private groups?Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Sincerely,"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1405432/harris-colleagues-blast-facebooks-continued-failure-to-monitor-and-enforce-gun-sales-ban&speechType=6	Guns Science, Technology and Communication		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-blast-facebooks-continued-failure-to-monitor-and-enforce-gun-sales-ban
VSKH33202040	Kamala Harris	2020-03-03	"Harris, Warren, Merkley Raise Concerns That DHS-Operated ""Tent Courts"" Violate Asylum Seekers' Due Process Rights"	statement	"U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) on Monday sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) raising concerns about the lack of access to appropriate legal services and lack of transparency at DHS-operated ""tent courts"" at the U.S.-Mexico border. The lawmakers questioned whether these conditions violate asylum seekers' due process rights and hinder critical oversight of those courts. They also renewed their calls to the Trump Administration to end its inhumane Remain in Mexico policy, which has forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait in extremely dangerous conditions while their asylum claims are processed. ""We are concerned that DHS and DOJ's current operation of the tent courts violates the due process rights of those seeking refuge at our borders and prevents meaningful oversight of the asylum adjudication process,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""As a result, we request that you provide additional information regarding the operation of these courts and the steps DHS and DOJ are taking, if any, to protect the rights of migrants seeking asylum."" The lawmakers' letter raises several concerns first raised by immigration lawyers, activists, journalists, and asylum seekers themselves: - Asylum seekers in tent courts have inadequate access to information about their legal options. For instance, tent courts do not provide a Legal Orientation Program, a resource provided in most immigration courts that educates asylum seekers about the asylum process and their available legal options. - Asylum seekers have poor access to counsel. Tent courts impose severe challenges to obtaining an attorney. Asylum seekers that do have counsel are often unable to meet with their attorneys outside of the tent courts and are often given as little as 15 minutes to meet with their attorneys inside the tent courts. Once inside the courtroom, DHS further handicaps migrants' attorneys by denying them access to technology in the courtroom, while DHS attorneys are granted full access. - The tent courts function as ""virtual immigration courtrooms,"" where judges remotely conduct hearings by video teleconference, denying migrants meaningful interaction with their judge. - Members of the public and the press have been granted only restricted access to observe proceedings in tent courts. Senators Harris, Warren, and Merkley have requested responses to their questions about the operations at the tent courts by March 13, 2020."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1407529/harris-warren-merkley-raise-concerns-that-dhs-operated-tent-courts-violate-asylum-seekers-due-process-rights&speechType=6	Legal Immigration		Washington D.C.	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-warren-merkley-raise-concerns-that-dhs-operated-tent-courts-violate-asylum-seekers-due-process-rights

""We are in a moment of crisis that requires leaders to respond swiftly and humanely in the interest of public health. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has failed to take sufficient commonsense actions that would save lives. That needs to change, now."" Last month, Senator Harris pressed the heads of DHS, ICE, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) about procedures and protocols to slow the spread of COVID-19, including guidance for releasing people to protect vulnerable individuals and standards for holding private contractors accountable. She also called on DHS, CBP, and ICE leaders to remove vulnerable and low-risk detained individuals from immigration detention facilities on recognizance, bond, parole, or via enrollment of individuals in alternatives to detention."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1418083/harris-statement-on-inhumane-conditions-at-otay-mesa-detention-center&speechType=6	Health and Health Care Immigration		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-inhumane-conditions-at-otay-mesa-detention-center_

VSKH244202030	Kamala Harris	2020-04-24	Harris, Colleagues Unveil Bill to Repeal GOP Tax Giveaway to Million-Dollar-Plus Earners in Coronavirus Relief Leg ...	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Representative Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) in unveiling legislation to repeal a massive tax giveaway for a small group of wealthy taxpayers that Republicans included in the coronavirus relief bill. The legislation would do away with provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates will reduce government revenue by $195 billion over ten years, and that would overwhelmingly benefit wealthy taxpayers like hedge fund managers and real estate speculators. Together, the Republican provisions are among the costliest parts of the CARES Act, despite having no real connection to battling coronavirus or its economic fallout. ""It's outrageous that Senate Republicans gave the richest individuals in our nation a tax break in COVID-19 relief bill,"" said Senator Harris. ""We need to be protecting the most vulnerable communities during this time, not giving away money to the rich. This is provision must be repealed immediately."" Joining Harris and Whitehouse on the bill in the Senate is Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), along with Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tom Udall (D-NM), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Markey (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE), Jack Reed (D-RI), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Joining Doggett on the bill in the House are Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), and Steve Cohen (D-TN), along with nearly 40 other House members. The Republican provisions, sections 2303 and 2304 of the CARES Act, allow wealthy taxpayers to use losses in certain years to avoid paying taxes in other years. Among other things, the changes allowed wealthy taxpayers to claim rich refund checks for the 2018 and 2019 tax years , before the coronavirus crisis hit. And unlike programs in the CARES Act that required employers use benefits to maintain payroll and support workers, sections 2303 and 2304 let wealthy taxpayers keep the benefits with no strings attached. Only after the Senate had already voted on the CARES Act did the full cost of the Republican provisions become clear. According to an analysis from the JCT, just 43,000 individual tax filers covered by one of the Republican provisions would see their tax liability fall by a combined $70.3 billion in 2020. Nearly 82 percent of those who will benefit from that provision make $1 million or more, with 95 percent making over $200,000. The tax benefits from the Republican provisions dwarf payments flowing to working Americans. Based on the JCT's analysis, millionaire tax filers benefiting from one of the provisions will see an average benefit of $1.6 million this year alone. In contrast, direct payments to most Americans under the CARES Act are capped at $1,200. The bill would repeal the Republican provisions and, in their place, add a provision designed to help small companies struggling to stay afloat. This provision would be available to companies with under $15 million in receipts that have not engaged in excessive executive compensation, dividends, or stock buybacks. Unlike the Republican provisions, the new provision would only apply to 2020 and would offer taxpayers advanced refunds of up to $100,000 now to give them cash when they need it. According to reports, beneficiaries of the tax giveaways may include President Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and ""real estate investors in President Trump's inner circle."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1420507/harris-colleagues-unveil-bill-to-repeal-gop-tax-giveaway-to-million-dollar-plus-earners-in-coronavirus-relief-legislation&speechType=6	Taxes		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-unveil-bill-to-repeal-gop-tax-giveaway-to-million-dollar-plus-earners-in-coronavirus-relief-legislation_

""Today's bipartisan House passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a big step forward in our march toward achieving the ideal of equal justice under law.

""I was honored to work with my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues, including Chairwoman Bass and Senator Cory Booker, to introduce the first-ever bold, comprehensive approach to change the culture of policing in America, hold police accountable for misconduct, and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Our legislation establishes a national use of force standard that allows officers to use deadly force only when necessary. It creates a national ban on no-knock warrants in drug cases. The bill gives state attorneys general the authority to launch independent investigations into police misconduct, and expands the Department of Justice's powers to conduct robust pattern and practice investigations into discrimination by law enforcement agencies. ""I applaud the House of Representatives for prioritizing this meaningful bill that will actually save lives. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation immediately.

Similar legislation was introduced in the House last year. IAIA provides competitive and formula grants for school infrastructure projects, including school construction and facilities upgrades, in school districts with high percentages of children with military parents or children living on Indian lands. With these grants, school districts would have the flexibility to focus on their specific renovation and repair needs, which could include changes to help protect the health, safety, and well-being of students, teachers, school leaders, and school personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities in California and across the nation, school districts need our support.

I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing the Impact Aid Infrastructure Act to give federally impacted school districts the assistance they need to continue to serve our communities during this public health emergency and beyond,"" Senator Harris said. ""As schools in Hawaii prepare to open in the coming weeks following coronavirus-related delays, it is essential they have the expanded tools to protect students, their families, and staff.

""Even before the pandemic, many federally impacted school districts were in need of significant repair and renovation to provide a safe learning environment , now, they must be able to accommodate remote learning and public health guidelines to protect the health of students, teachers, and staff,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""The Impact Aid Infrastructure Act is critical legislation to ensure these school districts can address the unique needs presented by this crisis and make the necessary repairs and renovations to ensure students, teachers, and staff have safe learning and working environments. I'm proud to lead this legislation with Senator Hirono and I will continue working to include this desperately needed funding in the next relief package so that schools on or near military communities, Federal or Tribal Lands in New York and across the country have the resources needed to provide every student with a quality education."" ""As schools in Minnesota and across the country prepare for a new school year, they are facing unprecedented challenges in preparing a safe school environment for students, teachers and support staff,"" said Senator Smith.

""As we continue to confront this pandemic, it's important to ensure that school districts can provide a quality education to their students - even those schools without the ability to fund their operations through property taxes,"" Senator Klobuchar said. ""This legislation will help ensure that even during these challenging times, local school districts in Minnesota on federal land can retain the teachers, technology, and transportation they need to help students succeed."" ""By addressing the backlog of Impact Aid projects, we can help federally impacted school districts in New Mexico repair or rebuild decades-old infrastructures,"" said Senator Heinrich.

VSKH58202019	Kamala Harris	2020-08-05	Harris Joins Menendez, Colleagues in Urging Trump Admin to Address Reports of Retaliation Among Workers of Color W ...	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and a group of 19 colleagues in sending a letter to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding reports that workers of color face disproportionate acts of retaliation when reporting workplace concerns related to COVID-19. A recent report by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found one in eight workers has perceived retaliatory actions from employers for raising safety concerns related to the pandemic. Furthermore, the report showed that Black and Latino workers were more likely to see retaliation in the workplace than white workers. Black and Latino workers were also more likely than white workers to have their COVID-19 concerns go unaddressed by their employers. Under the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act, workers who report workplace hazard concerns to their employers or OSHA are protected from being retaliated against from their employer. Without these whistleblower protections, employers could fire or punish workers who speak out. ""We write today with serious concerns regarding reports that workers of color face disproportionate acts of retaliation when reporting workplace concerns related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,"" the senators wrote to DOL Secretary Eugene Scalia and OSHA Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary Loren Sweatt. ""To date, federal OSHA has received over 5,000 complaints related to COVID-19, yet it has only issued a handful of citations, one of which was a reporting violation. As workers who were home at the start of the pandemic begin to return to work, these concerns of unsafe workplaces will only grow."" ""We are troubled by recent reports that employers have taken retaliatory actions against workers, specifically workers of color, who have asked that their concerns regarding COVID-19 be addressed,"" the senators added. ""A June data brief released by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that Black and Latino workers were more likely than white workers to report that they or someone at work may have been punished or fired for raising concerns about COVID-19 in the workplace."" ""Workers need to trust that OSHA will enforce whistleblower protections to shield them against retaliation when reporting workplace hazards, and hold bad employers accountable. Without confidence in OSHA, as the report illustrates, employers will be free to silence and punish Black and Latino workers,"" the senators concluded before outlining a series of questions about the number of investigations, complaints and completed cases to date. Joining Senators Harris and Menendez in sending this letter were Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Bob Casey Jr. (D-Penn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Mazie K.

The text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Secretary Scalia and Assistant Secretary Sweatt: We write today with serious concerns regarding reports that workers of color face disproportionate acts of retaliation when reporting workplace concerns related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 is the worst public health crisis in a century, with four million recorded infections and over 150,000 American lives lost in just a few short months. With the lack of specific, enforceable standards issued from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on COVID-19, essential employees who are on the front lines are rightfully concerned that their employers are not taking the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at their workplaces. To date, federal OSHA has received over 5,000 complaints related to COVID-19, yet it has only issued a handful of citations, one of which was a reporting violation. As workers who were home at the start of the pandemic begin to return to work, these concerns of unsafe workplaces will only grow. We are troubled by recent reports that employers have taken retaliatory actions against workers, specifically workers of color, who have asked that their concerns regarding COVID-19 be addressed. A June data brief released by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that Black and Latino workers were more likely than white workers to report that they or someone at work may have been punished or fired for raising concerns about COVID-19 in the workplace. Employers were twice as likely to retaliate against Black workers as white workers. In addition, employers were two times less likely to address Black workers' concerns than their white peers. These disturbing statistics are a stark illustration of one of many barriers communities of color face in overcoming this pandemic. According to NELP, Black and Latino workers would be more willing to speak out against employers if there were strong legal protections that would protect them from being punished or fired. Instead, workers avoid addressing issues of COVID-19 in the workplace altogether, out of fear of retribution from employers. Moreover, OSHA's failure to implement specific, enforceable standards on COVID-19 only exacerbates the existing challenges Black and Latino workers face. It is long past time for every part of the federal government, including OSHA, to take a hard look at the systemic racism, inequality, and biases that are layered into every facet of our society. The same communities of color that have long suffered discrimination are now being disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent findings from NELP on employer retaliation against workers of color is but one of the many types of prejudices these communities continue to endure. As the nation's top watchdog for worker safety, OSHA should bring justice to all workers facing punishment for speaking out, and it should resolve the implicit and explicit racial biases that underlie employer retaliation which disproportionately impacts Black and Latino workers. Workers need to trust that OSHA will enforce whistleblower protections to shield them against retaliation when reporting workplace hazards, and hold bad employers accountable. Without confidence in OSHA, as the report illustrates, employers will be free to silence and punish Black and Latino workers. In light of the findings in the report, please respond to the following questions no later than August 14, 2020: What are the total number of on board whistleblower investigators and supervisory investigators at OSHA for each year from 2013 through 2020?To date, how many COVID-19 related whistleblower complaints (i.e. COVID-19 related 11 C complaints) has OSHA received? How many of these complaints have been docketed? Please provide a breakdown of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes of these complaints.How many of these complaint investigations have been completed? How many are ongoing?How many of the complaints involved workers being fired or terminated for allegedly exercising their rights under the OSH Act?Of the completed cases, in how many cases has OSHA found employers to be in violation of whistleblower protection laws? In how many cases has OSHA found employers not in violation?Are you aware of disproportionate higher rates of retaliation cases against Black and Latino workers? If yes, how long as OSHA been aware and what has OSHA done to address the issue?Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. OSHA needs an effective, and reliable whistleblower protection program to protect marginalized workers from workplace retaliation. We look forward to your prompt response to our questions.

VSKH58202018	Kamala Harris	2020-08-05	Harris, Van Hollen, Menendez, Booker Introduce Legislation to Increase Diversity on CARES Oversight Commission	statement	"WASHINGTON , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Wednesday joined Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to introduce the CARES Congressional Oversight Commission Diversity Act, legislation to ensure that the communities who have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic are represented on the Congressional Oversight Commission. The Coronavirus crisis has disproportionally impacted Black, Latinx, Pacific Islander, and Native American individuals; however, the current makeup of the CARES Congressional Oversight Commission does not include representation of these communities. The Senators' bill would amend the CARES Act to modify the membership requirements of the Congressional Oversight Commission to ensure that groups disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting economic recession are represented on the Commission. ""People of color are being infected and dying from coronavirus at astounding and disproportionate rates. As our country responds to this public health crisis, Congress must be proactive in ensuring that the leadership on the CARES Congressional Oversight Commission reflects the people it serves. This legislation is a necessary step to make sure perspectives from the hardest hit communities are at the decision making table and resources are allocated for their unique needs,"" said Senator Harris. ""We know Black, Latinx, Pacific Islander, and Native American communities have been hit hardest by both the health and financial impacts of the coronavirus, and it is essential that these communities have a seat at the table in guiding and overseeing the federal response to the pandemic. This legislation will ensure that these communities are better represented on the Congressional Oversight Commission so they can play a key role in the process. We'll be pushing Senate leadership to include this crucial provision in the next relief package,"" said Senator Van Hollen. ""Communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic deserve a seat on the CARES Congressional Oversight Commission,"" said Senator Menendez. ""Only with their input can we fully understand how the relief provided by Congress is or is not reaching those who need it most. I fully support Sen. Van Hollen's legislation to add four members to the commission who represent these affected communities. I call on my colleagues to support this bill. Diversity is not an aspirational goal but an action item that constantly requires our attention."" ""From healthcare access and outcomes to economic security and opportunity, the COVID-19 crisis has exposed and deepened the deep-seated structural racial injustices in this country,"" said Senator Booker.""As we continue to respond to this pandemic we cannot leave anyone behind, which is why our bill will make important changes to ensure that the communities most impacted by this crisis are the ones involved and included in directing our response to it."" The individuals appointed to the CARES Act Congressional Oversight Commission are all committed, well-qualified public servants. However, none of them are from the Black, Latinx, Pacific Islander or Native American communities, all of which have been disproportionately hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Congressional Oversight Commission Diversity Act would double the number of non-Chair commission members , adding four new members , and require half of the total members to be from groups disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting economic recession. Text of the legislation can be found here. ###"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474474/harris-van-hollen-menendez-booker-introduce-legislation-to-increase-diversity-on-cares-oversight-commission&speechType=6	Government Operations Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-van-hollen-menendez-booker-introduce-legislation-to-increase-diversity-on-cares-oversight-commission
VSKH68202016	Kamala Harris	2020-08-06	Harris, Rosen Lead Letter Calling on CBP to Protect Unaccompanied Children at the Southern Border	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), both members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), on Thursday led 26 of their colleagues in a letter to Acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan regarding CBP's screening of unaccompanied children at the U.S. border. In their letter, the Senators ask Acting Commissioner Morgan to comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) protections for unaccompanied children, address misleading statements he made before HSGAC during an oversight hearing in June, and provide written responses to follow-up questions about CBP's screening practices for unaccompanied children. ""We write with concern regarding U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)'s treatment of unaccompanied children seeking humanitarian protection at the U.S. southern border. In a recent hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), you stated under oath that CBP is screening all unaccompanied children it encounters at the border for human trafficking and other protection concerns. That claim appears inconsistent with evidence indicating that CBP is summarily returning unaccompanied children to dangerous conditions without properly screening them to assess whether they are at risk of trafficking or fear return. Not only are such screenings required under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA); they also are essential to protecting vulnerable children from exploitation. We therefore urge prompt clarification of your testimony and full compliance with the TVPRA,"" wrote the Senators. In addition to Senators Harris and Rosen, Senators signing the letter include Senators Gary Peters (D-MI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tom Carper (D-DE), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chris Coons (D-DE), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Bob Casey (D-PA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Tina Smith (D-MN), Tom Udall (D-NM), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Jack Reed (D-RI). The full text of the letter can be found here and below. Dear Acting Commissioner Morgan: We write with concern regarding U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)'s treatment of unaccompanied children seeking humanitarian protection at the U.S. southern border. In a recent hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), you stated under oath that CBP is screening all unaccompanied children it encounters at the border for human trafficking and other protection concerns. That claim appears inconsistent with evidence indicating that CBP is summarily returning unaccompanied children to dangerous conditions without properly screening them in the case of children from Mexico and Canada, or designating them as unaccompanied and transferring them to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours. We therefore urge prompt clarification of your testimony and full compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As you know, in recognition of unaccompanied children's unique vulnerabilities, the TVPRA guarantees them distinct humanitarian safeguards.[1] Specifically, the Act requires CBP to screen all arriving unaccompanied children from Mexico and Canada to determine, in key part, whether they are victims of human trafficking, at risk of trafficking, or fear return to their home countries. Such children who meet the TVPRA screening criteria must be transferred into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and placed into full immigration court proceedings, thereby affording them the opportunity to pursue protection from the dangers those screenings helped identify. Similarly, the TVPRA mandates that CBP transfer all arriving unaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries into ORR custody and place them into full court proceedings, whereupon social workers and attorneys may screen them for protection concerns. Taken together, these TVPRA-mandated protocols are vital to uncovering, preventing, and combatting the trafficking, persecution, and other forms of exploitation perpetrated upon children. When questioned regarding screenings during a June 25 CBP oversight hearing before HSGAC, you testified under oath that CBP is screening all unaccompanied children who arrive to the United States. You further testified that all children subject to your policies implementing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) order under section 362 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 265, that limits entry into the United States, have been screened by CBP for trafficking and protection concerns (""they are all screened""). In fact, when asked in a follow-up question if ""a hundred percent of these kids were screened for trafficking and protection concerns"", you responded, ""Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am."" You were soon after asked for clarification and posed the following question: ""Regardless of seeing signs [of trafficking], the regulation is that all unaccompanied minors are screened. You are screening all unaccompanied minors, is that what I am understanding?"" You responded, ""Yes, ma'am."" Yet the available evidence does not support these claims. Numerous media reports show that under Title 42 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is swiftly returning arriving unaccompanied children[2] without affording them any TVPRA-mandated protections whatsoever.[3] CBP's own website states that individuals subject to Title 42 ""will immediately be expelled.""[4] In June alone, although CBP encountered over 1,650 unaccompanied children, it referred only 61, or less than four percent, of them to ORR.[5] And operational guidance issued to CBP personnel concerning Title 42 expulsions fails to reference, much less require, screenings for unaccompanied children.[6] The guidance's only provisions relating to humanitarian protection address claims under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and require direct action by CBP personnel only when individuals ""make an affirmative, spontaneous, and reasonably believable claim that they fear being tortured in the country they are being sent back to.""[7] It is unclear how an unaccompanied minor seeking protection would be sufficiently aware they need to affirmatively and spontaneously express their fear of torture. The guidance does not address the myriad other protection claims available to these children under U.S. law. Echoing this guidance, in the U.S. government's opposition to the plaintiff's complaint in J.B.B.C. v. Wolf, a lawsuit brought in response to DHS's application of Title 42 to an unaccompanied child, the sole protection screening identified by the government relates to the Convention Against Torture.[8] The government also acknowledges that ""CDC did not contemplate that CBP would implement the immigration laws concurrently with the CDC Order."" As such, the Trump Administration appears to have taken the position that, by definition, Title 42 expulsions sweep aside legal safeguards, including TVPRA-mandated screenings and the designation and transfer of eligible unaccompanied children to ORR custody. The weight of this evidence causes grave concern. Absent screenings and additional legal protections codified in the TVPRA, unaccompanied children, including the more than 2,000 unaccompanied children returned by DHS under Title 42[9], have no meaningful opportunity to pursue safety from the dangers they flee. Instead, these children undergo rapid expulsion to situations in Mexico and Central America where they face the prospect of trafficking and other severe harm, precisely the outcomes Congress intended to prevent with the TVPRA. Additionally, news reports indicate that not only is CBP falling short in screening children and designating them as unaccompanied, but also that CBP is transferring unaccompanied children as young as one year old to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is holding them in hotels before removing them without allowing them sufficient access to lawyers and Child Advocates.[10] There have also been reports of children being required to sign documents in English, without a translation, and being expelled without explanation of what is happening to them.[11] In view of the heightened risks facing these children, we request that you clarify your June 25 sworn testimony to HSGAC and provide written answers to the below questions no later than August 14. We also call upon CBP to fully adhere to all TVPRA requirements and to provide a report to our offices by August 21 detailing TVPRA compliance. The safety of these children depends on CBP's fidelity to the TVPRA. Is CBP screening for trafficking and protection concerns all minors under the age of 18 who arrive at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian and who lack lawful immigration status and who are arriving from the contiguous countries of Mexico and Canada, including those minors deemed subject to Title 42? Has CBP expelled under Title 42, any Mexican or Canadian minors under the age of 18 who arrived at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian and who lacked lawful immigration status, without screening for trafficking and other protection concerns? Has CBP expelled any minors under the age of 18 who arrived at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian who lacked lawful immigration status from non-contiguous countries instead of designating them unaccompanied and admitting them to ORR custody, per TVPRA's requirements? If so, how many?Please identify, since the CDC order went into effect on March 20, the number of minors who were under the age of 18, arrived without a parent or legal guardian, and lacked lawful immigration status that CBP has categorized under Title 42 versus the number of such minors categorized under Title 8. Please identify, as disaggregated by categorization under Title 42 and Title 8, respectively, the number of these children that CBP: (a) screened for trafficking and other protection concerns; (b) referred to ORR custody; and (c) both screened for trafficking and other protection concerns and subsequently referred to ORR custody.How many of the children processed under Title 8 were later processed under Title 42?If minors under the age of 18 who arrived without a parent or legal guardian and lacked lawful immigration status were not screened or admitted to ORR custody in compliance with the TVPRA, please describe the reason why in each instance.Please clarify how CBP is applying the TVPRA's requirements to minors subject to Title 42 who are under the age of 18, arrive at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian, and lack lawful immigration status.Please provide a detailed description of the protection screenings, if any, performed by CBP of minors from contiguous countries under the age of 18 who arrive at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian and who lack lawful immigration status, including such minors subject to Title 42. In that description, please specify whether CBP is conducting these screenings affirmatively, in what settings it is conducting them, whether it is using Form 93, and what arrangements, if any, it is making to ensure privacy and appropriate language interpretation access. Please also provide copies of:Any guidance, policies, or procedures issued to CBP personnel relating to any such screenings;Any forms and/or interview questions used as part of any such screenings;Any documentation provided to unaccompanied children who go through these screenings; andAll other documentation relating to any such screenings. What relevant training does CBP provide to personnel who conduct protection screenings of children? Please provide copies of all relevant training materials. Please identify the number of minors expelled under Title 42 who were under the age of 18, arrived at the U.S. border without a parent or legal guardian, and lacked lawful immigration status, both in total and as disaggregated by the minors' country of origin, country of return, age, and sex. Please also provide copies of any guidance, policies, or procedures relating to such children's return under Title 42. In implementing these Title 42 policies, what steps did CBP take to assess the potential detention or holding-related impacts to children, including but not limited to recent reports of children being held in hotels? How many unaccompanied children has CBP transferred to ICE or to an ICE contractor? What is the coordination between CBP and ICE regarding the transfer detention and holding of children that have been subjected to CBP's policies? In each case in which CBP transferred an unaccompanied child to ICE, please provide the age of the child; the number, sex, and ages of other children and adults with them; whether the child was able to speak with an attorney, Child Advocate, or parent while in CBP custody. Please provide copies of any documentation unaccompanied children are asked to sign.Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter.

VSKH68202017	Kamala Harris	2020-08-06	With In-Person Visits Suspended, Harris, Colleagues Advocate for Access to Free Telephone Calls and Video Conferen ...	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday joined Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Brian Schatz (D-HI), and 12 colleagues to send a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urging Congress to include provisions in the next economic relief package to provide access to free phone and video calls for incarcerated people in state and local facilities during and after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As many facilities have suspended in-person visits and families face layoffs, furloughs, and evictions due to the pandemic, these calls are more necessary, and cost prohibitive, than ever. Studies have shown that keeping in touch with family members while incarcerated can help reduce recidivism, enhancing public safety and saving taxpayer dollars. ""As it remains unclear when effective treatment or a vaccine will be available, ensuring that incarcerated people can stay connected with their loved ones while in-person visits are suspended is critical, but we must also support solutions to help keep families connected after the pandemic,"" the senators wrote. ""Regular communication with loved ones has consistently proven to help incarcerated people succeed in reentering the workforce after their release, and allowing them to stay connected will benefit them and their communities in the short and long term. We urge you now to include provisions in the next economic relief package to provide access to free phone and video calls for incarcerated people and their families both during and after the pandemic."" Harris, Klobuchar, Duckworth, Booker, and Schatz were joined by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Angus King (I-ME), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI). The full letter text can be found below and HERE: Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer: We write to urge you to include provisions in the next economic relief package to provide access to free phone and video calls for incarcerated people during and after the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. America's prisons and jails currently house more than 2.2 million people, a disproportionate number of whom are people of color. Before the pandemic, more than 50 percent of families with an incarcerated loved one struggled to pay for housing and food, and one in 29 children had a parent incarcerated. In addition, one in three families with an incarcerated loved one went into debt in order to stay connected with them, and women shouldered 87 percent of these costs. Now, as many facilities have suspended in-person visits and families face layoffs, furloughs, and evictions due to the pandemic, these calls are more necessary, and cost prohibitive, than ever. On July 16, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to lower the rate caps for interstate calls from prisons and jails, providing some relief for incarcerated people and their families. But interstate calls make up only 20 percent of all prison phone calls in the U.S., and courts have restricted the FCC's authority to regulate the other 80 percent of calls made within states, allowing telecommunications providers to charge families up to $25 for fifteen minutes. Without action from Congress to address the rates for instate calls, families will continue to suffer. As it remains unclear when effective treatment or a vaccine will be available, ensuring that incarcerated people can stay connected with their loved ones while in-person visits are suspended is critical, but we must also support solutions to help keep families connected after the pandemic. Regular communication with loved ones has consistently proven to help incarcerated people succeed in reentering the workforce after their release, and allowing them to stay connected will benefit them and their communities in the short and long term. We urge you now to include provisions in the next economic relief package to provide access to free phone and video calls for incarcerated people and their families both during and after the pandemic. Thank you for your attention to this highly important issue. We stand ready to work with you to help keep families connected at this critical time.

VSKH68202015	Kamala Harris	2020-08-06	Harris, Ocasio-Cortez Introduce Landmark Legislation to Empower Frontline Communities	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY-14) on Thursday introduced the Climate Equity Act, legislation to ensure that the United States government centers communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis in policy related to climate and the environment. For the last year, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez have worked with frontline community leaders to receive feedback on this legislation to ensure the strongest policy possible. ""COVID-19 has laid bare the realities of systemic racial, health, economic, and environmental injustices that persist in our country,"" said Sen. Harris. ""The environment we live in cannot be disentangled from the rest of our lives, and it is more important than ever that we work toward a more just and equitable future. That is why, as we combat the climate crisis and build a clean economy; we must put justice and equity first. I'm proud to partner with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez on this comprehensive proposal to empower communities that have been neglected by policymakers for far too long."" ""The Democratic Party is now finally starting to embrace what many activists have long advocated: climate policy must be driven by and centered around frontline communities,"" said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. ""Major environmental policies must be written by the black, brown, and low-income people who have been and will be disproportionately impacted by it, just like the Green New Deal envisioned. For too long, policies that affect communities of color have been determined by a few white men in a room in Washington. The budding grassroots movement and electoral results we're seeing around the country make clear that Americans want to upend old, exclusionary order. I'm proud to partner with Senator Harris on a bill that will pave the way for a new, inclusionary way of doing things in D.C."" The Climate Equity Act creates an administrative structure within the federal government to ensure that as we boldly address the climate crisis, our policies are founded in equity and justice for frontline communities. By ensuring that frontline community leaders and allies are playing a fundamental role in shaping and guiding federal policy, the Climate Equity Act helps hold the government accountable for creating a more just and equitable future as we tackle the climate crisis and build a clean economy. ""Frontline communities' are those that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities, environmental racism, and other forms of injustice, including low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and communities of color. As the climate crisis continues, these communities and others, including deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, vulnerable elderly populations, unhoused populations, and people with disabilities , and the women, youth, and future generations belonging to these communities , will be impacted first and hardest by the climate crisis. The Climate Equity Act holds the government accountable to frontline communities when it considers a policy, regulation, or investment with a climate or environmental nexus , which could broadly include direct policies to address the environment and climate change, but also transportation, housing, infrastructure, jobs, workforce development, and more. Specifically, the legislation will: Hold Congress Accountable Require relevant legislation receive an equity score that is both quantitative and qualitative to estimate the impact on frontline communities.The equity score will be modeled after the economic scores provided by the Congressional Budget Office, will be developed in consultation with experts and leaders from frontline communities, and will be updated periodically with the best available science.Hold the Executive Branch Accountable Require that relevant rules and regulations that have significant impact on frontline communities undergo an additional level of review. This review will aim to mitigate negative impacts, maximize benefits, and bring representatives from frontline communities into the regulatory review process.Require relevant federal grant-making and investment programs undergo review to ensure that frontline communities benefit by targeting investments and addressing existing barriers.Ensure Frontline Communities Lead Establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability with a Board of Advisors made up of members and allies of frontline communities to represent the views of frontline communities in rulemaking at the beginning of the rulemaking process. Establish a new position of Director for Climate and Environmental Justice at all relevant agencies to ensure compliance and coordination.Require that representatives of frontline communities are at the table during the drafting and review of relevant rules and regulations, providing insights and comments on how to minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits to frontline communities and ensure those insights and comments are addressed. Because the Climate Equity Act aims to establish accountability for justice and equity impacts of federal climate and environmental actions, advocates and allies from the most impacted communities provided feedback in formulating this legislation to ensure that together we build the strongest policy possible. ""For far too long environmental justice communities have lacked the laws needed to protect ourselves from legacy pollution and new harmful projects. The Climate Equity Act can be a useful tool for early assessment of proposed laws and policies and their impact on the quality of life of frontline communities,"" said Peggy Shepard, Co-Founder and Executive Director, WE ACT for Environmental Justice. ""We appreciate that the core of the bill centers the expertise and voices of people through the establishment of the Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability with a Board of Advisors made up of members and allies of frontline communities. We also appreciate the engagement that we have had with Senator Kamala Harris's office around drafting and providing input to the Climate Equity Act since early last year. Both Senator Harris and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have shown a commitment to advancing policies that address environmental and climate justice."" ""Ensuring our nation's climate legislative and policy agenda is built on a foundation of justice and equity is critical to achieving our democratic ideals,""said Cecilia Martinez, Executive Director, Center for Earth, Energy, and Democracy (CEED). ""This legislation will support our efforts toward this end. For too long, the most vulnerable in our nation have suffered the worst consequences of climate change, and the pollution of an energy sector impairing their health. The Climate Equity Act is essential and needed for us to move forward as a nation."" ""When our elders and the founders of the environmental justice/climate justice movement convened in Jemez, New Mexico in 1996, they knew that until our communities were centered they would never be adequately protected from the climate crisis and the myriad injustices that contribute to it - this understanding led to the 1996 Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing,""said Elizabeth Yeampierre, Co-Chair, Climate Justice Alliance Steering Committee and Executive Director, UPROSE. ""Centering, our communities, our leaders, including our young people, is a requisite and primary step for climate justice. The Climate Equity Act, if properly implemented, could be a key tool for ensuring that our communities are always at the table and multiple government agencies work in synergy to ensure intersectional and inclusive solutions."" ""Young people, poor people, and Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities have always borne the brunt of toxic pollution and climate collapse. These communities closest to the pain of the interlocking crises must also be closest to developing the solutions,"" said Lauren Maunus, Sunrise Movement Legislative Manager. ""Sunrise is grateful for Senator Harris and Representative Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to working hand-in-hand with impacted communities over the past year to draft the Climate Equity Act. This bill is foundational to the Green New Deal and the project of creating a more just and equitable country in the face of the climate crisis."" ""Every day, black and brown communities suffer disproportionally from a higher than average exposure to pollution and climate change,"" said Heather Toney, Moms Clean Air Force National Field Director. ""The Climate Equity Act will ensure that these communities have a seat at the policy making table and will lessen the impacts of structural racism to protect the health of the most vulnerable among us. Moms Clean Air Force applauds Senator Kamala D. Harris and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for investing in communities of color and ensuring there is justice in every breath."" ""For far too long, communities of color as well as low-income communities have not had a say in any number of crucial decisions,"" said Hilary O. Shelton, the Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and the Association's Senior VP for Policy and Advocacy. ""The result has too often been that we are left out of the decision making process. This is particularly concerning as these are decisions that may affect any number of vital issues such as our lives, our livelihoods, and the health and wellbeing of our families. Rather than having a seat at the policy making table, we have found ourselves on the menu. We commend Senator Harris and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez for introducing the forward-thinking Climate Equity Act. When fully implemented, we are convinced this important policy will create real improvements by keeping the people most impacted at the heart of the decision making process."" ""Black and brown communities continuously face unequal protection from pollution and often disproportionate harms from climate change. With Senator Harris' and Representative Ocasio-Cortez's Climate Equity Act, we are on a path toward a new and better process for establishing federal climate policies that empower the most climate-impacted communities,"" said K. Sabeel Rahman, president of Demos. ""This legislation advances community control by requiring equity assessments of proposed rules, legislation, and investments for addressing climate change, and by providing a foothold for communities overburdened by pollution and climate risks to inject their demands for equity and power into the policymaking process."" ""We applaud this bill for bringing the voices of those who suffer the worst impacts of climate change and pollution to the decision-making table and for holding polluters accountable for the devastation they have for far too long caused these communities,"" said Maria Handley, Director of Campaigns for Energy and Climate at The Wilderness Society. ""This important piece of legislation will ensure people of color, Indigenous populations, low-income and frontline communities are finally included and represented throughout the federal rule-making processes that regulates what happens in their own backyards."" ""Systemic racism and environmental injustice in this country has meant that power plants, incinerators, factories and other toxic facilities are often built next to Black and brown communities, leaving these communities to bear the brunt of air pollution and toxic exposure,"" said Elizabeth Gore, Senior Vice President, Political Affairs, Environmental Defense Fund. ""EDF is proud to support the Climate Equity Act, a powerful piece of legislation introduced today by Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY-14) that seeks to dismantle these long standing environmental injustices by establishing a robust and much-needed framework for incorporating environmental justice and equity in government decision making, including increased transparency and meaningful stakeholder participation."" ""We commend Senator Harris and Representative Ocasio-Cortez not only for introducing a bill that puts frontline communities and environmental justice leaders at the center of climate policy development, but also for ensuring that the Climate Equity Act itself was crafted through an inclusive process with environmental justice organizations and coalitions,"" said Sara Chieffo, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, League of Conservation Voters.

VSKH68202014	Kamala Harris	2020-08-06	Harris, Colleagues Introduce Resolution Celebrating the 55th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Thursday joined Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and 22 of their colleagues to introduce a Senate Resolution to recognize, commemorate, and celebrate the 55th anniversary of the enactment of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. President Lyndon Johnson proposed the legislation just days after the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, during which the late Representative John Lewis was savagely beaten by law enforcement officers while crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on what was to become known as ""Bloody Sunday."" The Voting Rights Act passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965. ""While we celebrate the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we must recommit to the fight for equality and fairness at the voting booth,"" said Senator Harris. ""Voter suppression is still happening around the country in the form of strict voter ID laws, limited voting hours, long wait times, and voter roll purges. Now more than ever, we must , as Congressman John Lewis said , get into ""good trouble' to ensure that we protect and expand access to the ballot box in America."" Harris and Markey are joined by Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Doug Jones (D-Ala.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Bob Casey, Jr. (D-Penn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). A copy of the Resolution can be found HERE. Since 2013, many States have passed discriminatory voting laws that have made it more difficult for people of color and low-income individuals to vote in elections. Nearly 1,200 polling locations have closed since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder. The country is witnessing a spread of voter suppression laws sweep across the country. From voter identification laws, to voter roll purges, elected officials are making it hard for Americans to vote. This Resolution affirms the Senate's commitment to modernizing and strengthening the Act through further legislative efforts. ""Today we commemorate and remember those who fought so hard and gave so much for the right to vote and celebrate the anniversary of this historic legislation,"" said Senator Markey. ""But we cannot stop there. We must commit ourselves to fully restoring and strengthening the Voting Rights Act, and to fighting any effort to suppress voting."" ""55 years later, the Voting Rights Act remains a powerful reminder that America can move closer to our highest ideals , but only if we insist on it, work at it, and take seriously our responsibility as citizens in this democracy,"" said Senator Bennet. ""Today that means protecting our right to vote from threats like voter suppression, partisan gerrymandering, disinformation, and elections awash in special interest money. It also means not only celebrating the Voting Rights Act, but strengthening it for the 21st century."" ""Today, as we mark the 55th anniversary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, we also honor the legacy of those who sacrificed so much to fight for the right to vote, including the late Congressman John Lewis,"" said Senator Hirono. ""His lifetime of advocacy for gaining and protecting access to the ballot box should remain our guide as we stand firmly against Donald Trump's continued attacks on our elections, including his efforts to suppress voter turnout, shut down the U.S. Postal Service, and undermine voting by mail."" ""Today's anniversary is a time to remember all of the great Americans who fought for their God-given right to vote, 55 years ago,"" said Senator Wyden.""And it's yet another opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the hard work of carrying on that fight against all of the forces that are intent on suppressing Americans' right to vote safely and securely."" ""Fifty five years ago the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law to protect the constitutional right to vote and this right remains under attack today. Our fight to take on voter suppression and ensure access to the ballot is not over,"" said Senator Baldwin. ""That is why we must take action and pass the bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore full protections for all Americans' right to vote. I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate to do right by John Lewis and work together to end voting discrimination so we can guarantee that all Americans have equal access to vote and let their voices be heard."" ""The Voting Rights Act gave voting protections to millions of Black, Latino, Asian and Native Americans who were previously shut out of the democratic process,"" said Senator Cortez Masto. ""This legislation is a monument to the leaders of the civil rights movement, including Congressman John Lewis, who put their lives on the line so that America could live up to its promise for all Americans. It remains one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation in American history. However, communities of color across the United States still face barriers to exercising their right to vote because bad actors have worked to roll back these key protections. I'm proud to sponsor this resolution to commemorate this vital piece of legislation, while also rededicating myself to fighting for legislation that builds on this legacy and protects every American's right to participate in the safe, free and fair elections that are the bedrock of this nation."" ""Voting is a basic and fundamental right. On behalf of the generations who fought valiantly to rid our country of oppressive and racist restrictions on access to the ballot box, we fully dedicate ourselves to the goals of the Voting Rights Act and commit to fight pernicious efforts to roll back hard-fought civil rights protections,"" said Senator Blumenthal. ""Voting is the most sacred right, and as U.S. citizens we must fight to protect this right now more than ever,"" said Senator Menendez. ""The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was only possible because of the ""good trouble' caused by those like Congressman John Lewis who took to heart the mission of defending and fully participating in our democracy to shape this nation for the better. As we mourn Congressman Lewis's passing, the best way we can honor his legacy is by recommitting ourselves to the fight for the right to vote and fully restore this historic legislation. And together, we must stand up to Republican's efforts to suppress voting in 2020 and beyond."" ""As we celebrate the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark bill to end racial discrimination in voting, we must remind ourselves there is still work to be done,"" said Senator Feinstein. ""The Constitution guarantees the right to vote but institutional barriers exist to prevent voters of color from exercising that right. Our resolution will remind Americans of the progress we've made, the challenges we still face and the need to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to overcome them."" ""Despite the signing of the original Voting Rights Act 55 years ago today, hundreds of thousands of Americans are still denied their rights at the ballot box. The right to vote is at the heart of our democracy, and Congress must work to put an end to the systemic disenfranchisement that hurts so many marginalized communities,"" said Senator Kaine. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues in recognizing the important history of this fight, and will keep pushing Republican leadership to put the Voting Rights Advancement Act up for a vote."" ""The Voting Rights Act was a landmark law, only made possible by the efforts of so many , including our late friend and colleague, John Lewis , who fought fiercely for every American's right to vote,"" said Senator Van Hollen.""But 55 years later, communities of color are too often deliberately denied that fundamental right. In commemorating this historic anniversary, we must fight all the harder to stamp out voter suppression, pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and follow John's exhortation to get in the way of injustice."" ""The right to vote is one of the most sacred fundamental American rights. It's a right that so many Americans fought and risked their lives for to ensure that every man and woman , no matter their income or skin color, can participate in our elections,"" said Senator Warner. ""This resolution commemorates 55 years since the enactment of the landmark Voting Rights Act and the work that remains, particularly after the Shelby v. Holder decision, to protect voting rights and ensure that all Americans have their voices heard at the ballot box."" ""As John Lewis recognized, the promise of America will never be fulfilled until each and every American has guaranteed and equal access to the ballot box,"" said Senator Merkley. ""American elections should be won or lost by convincing the voters, not by denying some of them the right to cast a ballot. So on this anniversary of the landmark Voting Rights Act, I would hope that every Democrat and Republican who recently praised Congressman Lewis's lifetime of leadership and heroism will commit to a full restoration and expansion of the Voting Rights Act. All Americans must be able to fully participate in our democracy."" ""With this resolution commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, we honor the sacrifices of civil rights leaders and activists who put their lives and bodies on the line to fight for the fundamental right to vote,"" said Senator Durbin. ""Unfortunately, far too many Americans, particularly in communities of color, continue to face unnecessary and discriminatory barriers to the ballot box. Addressing these challenges begins by restoring the Voting Rights Act and ensuring that voting is accessible to every American."" ""We mark fifty-five years since the Voting Rights Act became law only weeks after losing one of its fiercest defenders , John Lewis,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""As we celebrate this historic legislation, we must recommit to fully restoring its intent. It is on us to finish the work that John Lewis and so many others risked their lives for to end voter disenfranchisement for Black and minority Americans, and all those who have been victims of voter suppression."" ###"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474480/harris-colleagues-introduce-resolution-celebrating-the-55th-anniversary-of-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965&speechType=6	Government Operations		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-colleagues-introduce-resolution-celebrating-the-55th-anniversary-of-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965
VSKH108202013	Kamala Harris	2020-08-10	Harris, Feinstein, Carbajal: Include Funding to Protect Incarcerated Individuals in COVID-19 Package	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Congressman Salud Carbajal (D-CA) on Monday called on House and Senate leadership to quickly finalize a COVID-19 emergency response package that includes critical assistance to respond to outbreaks in federal prisons in California. ""We are concerned that BOP has not yet implemented universal testing or onsite testing for inmates and staff to stop the spread of the virus throughout the prison system or within our communities"" the members wrote. ""We therefore urge you to work swiftly to ensure the necessary funds are made available to better equip the BOP in handling this crisis. The House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act, with $200 million for the BOP to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks, over 10 weeks ago. Our communities cannot afford further delays."" A recent report by the Department of Justice's inspector general found significant shortcomings in Lompoc Prison's COVID-19 response, including insufficient testing of inmates and staff. The members emphasized in their letter the need for funding to assist with testing, acquisition of personal protective equipment, and other efforts to mitigate COVID-19's spread in federal prisons. Full text can be found HERE and below. Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer: We write today urging you to expeditiously finalize the COVID-19 emergency response package and include critical assistance for the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to respond to the ongoing pandemic. This support is immediately needed to assist with testing, provide personal protective equipment (PPE), and ensure the BOP can prevent the virus from propagating further within our federal prisons. As you know, the BOP is responsible for over 140,000 inmates in BOP-managed institutions and community-based facilities throughout the nation. Per BOP data, over 9,000 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19. In California, nearly 1,700 inmates and staff have tested positive within Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) and Lompoc Federal Correction Complex (FCC). We are extremely concerned by how quickly the virus spread and the BOP's response to this crisis. It highlights the need for universal testing and sufficient PPE for inmates and staff without any further delay. The recent report from the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that testing within BOP facilities has been limited. In cases where universal testing was implemented, like within Lompoc FCI, over 75 percent of inmates tested positive. While the BOP has not communicated plans to provide testing for their staff onsite, the OIG report highlights that only 53 of 416 staff members at Lompoc FCC were tested for COVID-19 in May. Of those that were tested, approximately 60 percent tested positive. This is very troubling as individuals that work in the facility could be exposed to the virus and unknowingly spread it within their communities. As we know from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals are equally capable of transmitting this disease to others as those showing symptoms. We are concerned that BOP has not yet implemented universal testing or onsite testing for inmates and staff to stop the spread of the virus throughout the prison system or within our communities. We therefore urge you to work swiftly to ensure the necessary funds are made available to better equip the BOP in handling this crisis. The House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act, with $200 million for the BOP to respond to COVID-19 outbreaks, over 10 weeks ago. Our communities cannot afford further delays. Thank you for your consideration of our request. Please do not hesitate to contact our office should you have any questions. We stand ready to provide any assistance needed.

VSKH108202012	Kamala Harris	2020-08-10	Harris, Warren, Underwood, Colleagues Announce Bicameral Legislation to Combat Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Cr ...	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) on Monday joined Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Representative Lauren Underwood (D-IL), along with Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Tina Smith (D-MN), in introducing the Maternal Health Pandemic Response Act to improve research and data collection, safeguard the health of pregnant and postpartum individuals, and dedicate resources to combat the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation confronts the structural racism that drives disparities in maternal health outcomes by prioritizing racial equity and tasking the federal government with improving the delivery of and access to anti-racist, culturally congruent, and respectful maternity care. In 2018, Harris introduced legislation addressing the biases in our nation's health care system that have contributed to the Black maternal mortality crisis. In March, Harris and Underwood introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, which includes nine bills to comprehensively address the Black maternal health crisis. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) understanding of the specific impact of COVID-19 on pregnant people is limited, in part due to a lack of robust data collection. The data CDC has managed to collect suggests that pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and are at a higher risk for intensive care unit admissions than nonpregnant women. The CDC has also found that Hispanic and Black pregnant women were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. As of August 4, 2020, over 15,000 pregnant women have tested positive for COVID-19 and 37 pregnant women have died. ""The potential dangers that come with giving birth during a pandemic - and specifically a pandemic that is disproportionately impacting Black and brown people - is of particular concern to women of color,"" said Senator Harris. ""As our nation continues to address the coronavirus crisis, we must prioritize steps to improve maternal health outcomes. That is why I am proud to join my colleagues to introduce this legislation that ensures COVID-19 response efforts include comprehensive and inclusive care for pregnant and postpartum individuals."" ""COVID-19 and the maternal mortality and morbidity crises are hitting our country hard - and hitting Black communities and Indian Country the hardest,"" said Senator Warren. ""Our bill will ensure the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic centers pregnant people and confronts the systemic racism and discrimination in our health care system."" ""The coronavirus pandemic has further exacerbated our nation's maternal mortality crisis- increasing health risks for moms, especially Black women and other women of color who have been disproportionately affected, said Representative Underwood. ""We must take swift and serious action to better understand and respond to the new threats facing moms. I'm proud to join Senator Warren to introduce the Maternal Health Pandemic Response Act, which makes critical investments to combat our nation's maternal health crisis during COVID-19. By dedicating resources for improved data collection, inclusive coronavirus vaccine and therapeutic development, and safety in maternity care, we can keep moms protected during this pandemic and beyond."" ""We know the pandemic has exacerbated the deep-seated structural inequities in maternal health care access and outcomes that are putting pregnant people of color disproportionately at risk,"" said Senator Booker. ""Maternal healthcare is essential healthcare, and now more than ever, we have a responsibility to work to ensure that as we respond to this pandemic we are prioritizing the health of pregnant people."" ""COVID-19 has deepened existing racial inequalities in public health, and we must take decisive action to combat the maternal mortality and morbidity crises,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""The Maternal Health Pandemic Response Act will ensure the federal government develops and implements policies to help end the racial disparities in maternal health during the pandemic and beyond."" ""We need to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic by helping individuals-especially people of color-access excellent health care,"" said Senator Smith. ""That requires bold action to root out systemic racism, injustice and inequalities in health care and beyond. This bill is an important step in making sure pregnant people get better support and are included in the federal government's coronavirus public health response."" This maternal mortality and morbidity crisis is fueled by racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities, comorbidities, inadequate access to the health care system, and structural racism - the same factors that have contributed to the substantial racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. The Maternal Health Pandemic Response Act would: Improve Data Collection, Research, and Surveillance Initiatives. The bill requires the CDC to coordinate, collect, and publicly post data related to COVID-19 and pregnancy disaggregated by race, ethnicity, state, and tribal location. The bill also authorizes funding for CDC's pregnancy surveillance programs and the National Institutes of Health's research programs. It also mandates CDC tribal consultation and confer with urban Indian organizations, in collaboration with the Indian Health Service.Ensure the Inclusion of Pregnant People in Vaccine and Therapeutic Development for COVID-19. This bill directs the NIH to ensure that at least one COVID-19 vaccine is developed and made available for use in pregnancy and lactation. It adds reporting and data collection requirements for COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccine developers regarding their product's use in pregnancy and lactation. And it emphasizes the inclusion of pregnant people, including those from underrepresented populations, in clinical trials when safe and appropriate.Improve Public Health Information and Communication for Pregnant People. The bill directs the CDC to undertake a robust public health education effort aimed at informing pregnant people, their employers, and their providers about the latest evidence-based health information. It also requires the Secretary of Labor to issue an emergency temporary standard for pregnant workers and all workers.Ensure Lasting Maternal Health Care and Birthing Experience Improvements. The bill defines anti-racist, culturally congruent, and respectful maternity care and seeks to improve the provision of this type of care. It creates a Task Force on Birthing Experience and Safe, Respectful Maternity Care to develop federal recommendations to ensure the provision of quality, nondiscriminatory maternity care and the improvement of maternal health outcomes during the COVID-19 public health emergency. It also mandates a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency to assess the delivery of maternal care during the pandemic and make recommendations for future pandemic preparedness and response related to maternal care.The legislation is endorsed by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Center for American Progress, Center for Reproductive Rights, In Our Own Voice: National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda, Every Mother Counts, March of Dimes, March for Moms, National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, National Birth Equity Collaborative, National Partnership for Women and Families, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.

VSKH128202011	Kamala Harris	2020-08-12	Harris: Republicans Are Rushing Confirmation to Strike Down Affordable Care Act	statement	WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Monday participated in the hearing to consider the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. Senator Harris spoke out against Senate Republicans' attempt to jam through a nominee who will take away healthcare from millions of Americans, all while our nation is in the midst of a deadly pandemic. In her statement, Harris highlighted that the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the rights she fought to protect are at stake with Judge Barrett's nomination. Harris demanded the committee wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after the American people, who are currently voting, have the chance to decide who they want in the White House. Key Excerpts: This hearing has brought together more than 50 people to sit inside of a closed door room for hours while our nation is facing a deadly airborne virus.

Our voting rights are at stake. Workers' rights are at stake. Consumer rights are at stake. The right to safe and legal abortion is at stake. Holding corporations accountable is at stake. And again there is so much more.I believe we must listen to our constituents and protect their access to health care, and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after Americans decide who they want in the White House.A full transcript of Harris' statement, as delivered: HARRIS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This hearing has brought together more than 50 people to sit inside of a closed door room for hours while our nation is facing a deadly airborne virus. This committee has ignored commonsense requests to keep people safe , including not requiring testing for all members , despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee. By contrast, in response to this recent Senate outbreak, the leaders of Senate Republicans rightly postponed business on the Senate floor this week to protect the health and safety of senators and staff. Mr. Chairman, for the same reasons, this hearing should have been postponed. The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facilities workers, janitorial staff, and congressional aides, and Capitol Police at risk. Not to mention, that while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills, the Senate should be prioritizing coronavirus relief and providing financial support to those families. The American people need to have help to make rent or their mortgage payment. We should provide financial assistance to those who have lost their job, and help parents put food on the table. Small businesses need help. As do the cities, towns, and hospitals that this crisis has pushed to the brink. The House bill would help families and small businesses get through this crisis, but Senate Republicans have not lifted a finger for 150 days, which is how long that bill has been here in the Senate, to move the bill. Yet this committee is determined to rush a Supreme Court confirmation hearing through in just 16 days. Senate Republicans have made it crystal clear that rushing a Supreme Court nomination is more important than helping and supporting the American people who are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a devastating economic crisis. Their priorities are not the American people's priorities. But for the moment, Senate Republicans hold the majority in the Senate and determine the schedule, so here we are. The Constitution of the United States entrusts the Senate with the solemn duty to carefully consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Yet the Senate majority is rushing this process and jamming President Trump's nominee through the Senate while people are actually voting. Just 22 days before the end of the election. More than 9 million Americans have already voted and millions more will vote while this illegitimate committee process is underway. A clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill this seat. And my Republican colleagues know that. Yet they are deliberately defying the will of the people in their attempt to roll back the rights and protections provided under the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember: In 2017, President Trump and Congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, but remember people from all walks of life spoke out and demanded Republicans stop trying to take away the American peoples health care. Republicans finally realized the Affordable Care Act is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work. That's why President Trump promised to only nominate judges who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. This administration, with the support of Senate Republicans, will be in front of the Supreme Court on November 10th to argue that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. That's in 29 days that that'll happen. That's a big reason why Senate Republicans are rushing this process. They are trying to get a justice onto the Court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act. And if they succeed, it will result in millions of people losing access to health care at the worst possible time in the middle of a pandemic. 23 million Americans could lose their health insurance altogether. If they succeed, they will eliminate protections for 135 million Americans with preexisting conditions like diabetes and asthma, heart disease or cancer. A list that now will include over 7 million Americans who have contracted COVID-19. Insurance companies could deny you coverage, or could sell you a plan that won't pay a dime toward treating anything related to your preexisting condition. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, you will have to once again pay for things like mammograms and cancer screenings, and birth control. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. And young adults will be kicked off their parents' plans. And these are not abstract issues. We need to be clear about how overturning of the ACA will impact the people we all represent. For example, Myka, who is eleven years old and she lives in Southern California. So Myka enjoys being a Girl Scout and ice-skating and reading, eating pasta, and baking. Her mother says the only reason Myka is able to live her life as she does now is because the Affordable Care Act guarantees that her health insurance cannot deny her coverage or limit her care because it's too expensive. You see, Myka has a Congenital heart defect. She goes to multiple specialists throughout the year and gets an MRI with anesthesia every six months. At just eleven months old, Myka's family had already hit $50,000 in medical expenses. And her biannual MRI costs $15,000 a session. And so correction: by 11 months old her family had already hit $500,000 in medical expenses. If Republicans succeed in striking down the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will be able to deny coverage to children with serious conditions. Children like Myka. And parents, well, they'll be on their own. No one should face financial ruin to get their child, their spouse, or their parent the care they need. And no family should be kept from seeing a doctor or getting treatment because an insurance company says the treatment is too expensive. In America, access to health care should not be determined based on how much money you have. Health care and access to health care should be a right. Myka and millions of others who are protected by the Affordable Care Act know this is fundamentally what is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. And of course there's more at stake. Throughout our history, Americans have brought cases to the United Sates Supreme Court in the ongoing fight for civil rights, human rights, and equal justice. Decisions like Brown v. Board of Education, which opened up educational opportunities for Black boys and girls, Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's right to control her body. Loving v. Virginia and Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized that love is love, and that marriage equality is the law of the land. The United States Supreme Court is often the last refuge for equal justice when our constitutional rights are being violated. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life to this fight for equal justice. And she defended the constitution. She advocated for human rights and equality. She stood up for the rights of women. She protected workers. She fought for the rights of consumers against big corporations. She supported LGBTQ rights. And she did so much more. But now, her legacy and the rights she fought so hard to protect are in jeopardy. By replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with someone who will undo her legacy, President Trump is attempting to roll back Americans' rights for decades to come. Every American must understand that with this nomination, equal justice under law is at stake. Our voting rights are at stake. Workers' rights are at stake. Consumer rights are at stake. The right to a safe and legal abortion is at stake. And holding corporations accountable is at stake. And again there is so much more. So Mr. Chairman, I do believe this hearing is a clear attempt to jam through a Supreme Court nominee who will take health care away from millions people during a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 214,000 Americans. I believe we must listen to our constituents and protect their access to health care, and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after Americans decide who they want in the White House. Thank you. ### Print	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474520/harris-republicans-are-rushing-confirmation-to-strike-down-affordable-care-act&speechType=6	Government Operations Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-republicans-are-rushing-confirmation-to-strike-down-affordable-care-act
VSKH218202010	Kamala Harris	2020-08-21	Harris, Feinstein Push for Expedited Major Disaster Declaration Amid Ongoing California Wildfires	statement	August 21, 2020 The Honorable Donald J. Trump The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We strongly support California Governor Gavin Newsom's request for a Major Disaster declaration on August 20, 2020, for the State of California in response to the devastating wildfires burning in Lake, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, and Yolo Counties. Due to the catastrophic and rapidly developing nature of these wildfires and in order to help the affected communities and individuals rebuild as soon as possible, we ask that you expedite the declaration without the need for complete preliminary damage assessments and make federal assistance available under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, including Public Assistance Category A, Category B, Direct Federal Assistance, and Individual Assistance. The heat wave that began on August 14 has resulted in record-breaking temperatures and red flag warnings throughout the state. Exacerbated by the extreme fire conditions, lightning storms sparked fires across Northern California. As of August 20, over 350 fires have resulted from more than 10,000 lightning strikes. Five of the most significant fires, the LNU Lightning Complex, the CZU August Lightning Complex, the River Fire, the Jones Fire, and the Carmel Fire have burned more than 209,643 acres, destroyed at least 3,326 residences, and are threatening more than 42,154 structures. Over the last few years, California has experienced its largest, most destructive, and deadliest wildfires in history. The current explosion of wildfire activity has resulted in incredible strain on California's resources and firefighting capabilities. Even without the added challenge presented by the COVID-19 crisis, the destruction and magnitude of these fires would be extraordinary. Governor Newsom has determined that the severity of the wildfires is beyond the State's capabilities, and we appreciate your swift response in issuing an expedited Major Disaster declaration. Thank you for your consideration of this urgent request.

VSKH27820209	Kamala Harris	2020-08-27	As The School Year Begins, Harris, Senators Call On FCC To Bolster Lifeline Program To Keep Students Connected	statement	Dear Chairman Pai, We write to express our profound frustration that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has failed to take forceful action to keep households connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. As millions of American families face unprecedented financial pressures and educational challenges, we urge the FCC to reverse proposed changes to the Lifeline program, take immediate steps to open its assistance to more households, and ensure that its services meet the pressing needs of families during this crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and even reinforced the vast homework gap that has left millions of children offline because their parents cannot afford broadband internet access. Schools across the country are grappling with this digital divide as they decide whether they can safely reopen and whether virtual learning will work. According to Common Sense Media, one quarter of students nationally are at risk of being left out of the classroom because they lack broadband or connected devices, a toll that falls disproportionately and disastrously on communities of color. Unfortunately, the homework gap has already had an immense cost to children during this crisis, as some students have been forced to forgo online lectures and miss important homework. We are alarmed that as students head back to class , in person or online , there is still no national plan from the FCC to secure families' access to their educational future. This looming disaster is one product of the vast digital divide that hinders families' educational futures, economic opportunities, and health, which FCC should vigorously bridge through Lifeline and other USF programs. The FCC already has the ability to take immediate steps to close the homework gap and ensure that families have access to broadband. One of the FCC's most important assistance programs, Lifeline, was established under the Reagan Administration to provide discounts for free or low cost phone services to those who qualify for other financial assistance. In the four decades since, the Lifeline program has been supported and expanded on a bipartisan basis , a resounding recognition that phone and internet access is essential for economic security, health, and family life. Lifeline has lived up to its name for millions of veterans needing telehealth services, domestic violence survivors, older Americans, those experiencing housing insecurity, and other vulnerable Americans. Our immense reliance on broadband during the pandemic for telework, virtual learning, social connections, and telehealth has proven the original, bipartisan vision of Lifeline. Regrettably, under your Chairmanship, the FCC has actively worked to undermine and destabilize the Lifeline program, which has left more families vulnerable during the pandemic by widening the learning gap and lessening household's ability to access crucial services, such as unemployment benefits, food assistance, and health resources. Since the first weeks of your tenure, the FCC has sought to block new broadband providers' participation in the Lifeline program, curtail benefits in tribal areas, exclude existing carriers, rollback reforms for registering new carriers, make it harder for new applicants to subscribe, prevent carriers from offering free in-person distribution of phones, reduce incentives to enroll subscribers, and add more barriers for participating carriers and subscriber. These proposals have been so extreme that they would lead to cutting off carriers serving almost 70% of Lifeline subscribers. The FCC has also failed to complete important reforms to ease burdens on consumers and reduce fraud, such as the full implementation of the National Verifier meant to automate registration and preserve the integrity of Lifeline. Lastly, carriers face continued uncertainty about the long-term stability of the program given the open FCC proposals to cut back participation and compensation for services. The consequences of this sustained assault on Lifeline are stark , less than 20% eligible households subscribe to services, as much as a 30% drop during your watch. The FCC should step up to tackle the profound inequities and divides that American families are struggling with during this national crisis. We appreciate that the FCC issued and extended the temporary waivers in response to the pandemic to pause usage and subscriber documentation requirements, and also appreciate that it partnered with state utility commissioners to improve public awareness of the program. But, by the benchmark established during previous crises, such as Hurricane Katrina, the FCC response falls far short. Lifeline could be a reprieve for millions of households. The FCC should take the initiative to ensure that Lifeline meets the connectivity needs of households sheltering in place at home and facing financial hardship during the COVID-19 crisis. However, regrettably, you have asked your Commissioner colleagues to vote on order that would permanently alter the minimum standards for Lifeline without changes in contributions, which could potentially lead to the loss of the free Lifeline services in the middle of this pandemic. We support increasing Lifeline subscribers' data allowances during this crisis, but such increases should be backed with additional funding. At this critical moment, the FCC should provide the additional financial support needed for Lifeline subscriptions to meet the data demands of virtual classroom time, telehealth, and telework during this time. It is time for the FCC to offer a bold plan to respond to this national crisis through bolstering the Lifeline program, and the Commission does not need to wait to act. We strongly urge you to immediately take the following steps: Take emergency measures to provide additional financial support to Lifeline providers during the pandemic to temporarily provide unlimited mobile data and voice minutes, and notify Congress if additional funding is needed to support such changes.Extend all current FCC waivers on Lifeline usage and subscriber documentation requirements for at least a full year, until August 2021 or when we have recovered from the pandemic.Close the currently outstanding Lifeline proposed rulemakings that would create new obstacles for eligible households and add unwarranted burden on carriers.Pause the scheduled changes to Lifeline program's minimum service standards until the Commission studies such impacts on the market in its upcoming 2021 State of Lifeline Marketplace Report, to avoid disruptions to customer's services.Restore the monthly subsidy to $9.25 for plans offering voice services for subscribers who value voice over data-heavy plans and pause the planned decrease in contributions for voice support.Work with states to increase the automated verification of state databases with the National Verifier program by the end of this year.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

VSKH13920208	Kamala Harris	2020-09-13	Readout of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris's Call with Mark Ghilarducci, Director of Cal OES about California Wildfires	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Mark Ghilarducci, Director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) on Sunday held a call to discuss California's response to the current wildfire crisis. Senator Harris's call with Director Ghilarducci is the latest in a series of conversations with state leaders concerning this year's devastating fire season. This week, Senator Harris also spoke with California Governor Gavin Newsom. ""California has been devastated by wildfires that have claimed precious lives, destroyed communities, and forced thousands of Californians to evacuate in the midst of a pandemic. We owe a debt of gratitude to the brave firefighters working around the clock to protect us,"" said Senator Kamala Harris. ""Let's be clear: these wildfires are a result of the climate crisis and we must take action that meets the needs of this moment."" Director Ghilarducci briefed Senator Harris on the historic major fires currently burning in California and what steps are being taken to contain them. Director Ghilarducci shared how California is coordinating emergency services during this wildfire season in order to minimize the danger posed to people and property. Senator Harris thanked Director Ghilarducci for his work and discussed the importance of ensuring federal support for California. Senator Harris voiced her ongoing concerns about the compounding dangers of COVID-19 & wildfire season, and reaffirmed her commitment to help in any way possible. Director Ghilarducci and Senator Harris agreed to have frequent discussions about what steps are being taken to protect Californians as they face the threats of fires and COVID-19. They vowed to continue to find ways to work together going forward. In 2018, Senator Harris helped secure a wildfire funding fix to ensure that the U.S. Forest Service can use its funding to better manage forests. She also introduced the Wildfire Defense Act, legislation to provide grants communities to comprehensively plan for wildfires and build community wildfire resilience. Since March, Senator Harris has raised questions with FEMA about wildfire preparedness during the pandemic through oversight hearings, calls, and letters. ###"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474502/readout-of-us-senator-kamala-harriss-call-with-mark-ghilarducci-director-of-cal-oes-about-california-wildfires&speechType=6	Social		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/readout-of-us-senator-kamala-harriss-call-with-mark-ghilarducci-director-of-cal-oes-about-california-wildfires
VSKH19920207	Kamala Harris	2020-09-19	Statement by Senator Kamala Harris & Doug Emhoff on The Passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg	statement	"Tonight we mourn, we honor, and we pray for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. Tomorrow we fight for her legacy. For all who believe in the power of the law as a force for change, Justice Ginsburg was and will always be a titan. She was a relentless defender of justice in our country and a legal mind for the ages. She also remained, throughout her life, a proud daughter of Brooklyn, with immigrant roots and a fire lit from an early age as a champion for progress and equality. Justice Ginsburg was known to pose the question, ""What is the difference between a bookkeeper in the Garment District and a Supreme Court justice?"" Her answer: ""One generation."" She never forgot where she came from, or those who sacrificed to help her grow into the historic icon we all came to revere. Even as we focus on the life that she led and process tonight's grief, her legacy and the future of the court to which she dedicated so much can't disappear from our effort to honor her. In some of her final moments with her family, she shared her fervent wish to ""not be replaced until a new President is installed."" We will honor that wish. Justice Ginsburg used every ounce of life she was bestowed to urge our nation down a path toward equal justice. Doug and I send our heartfelt prayers to Jane and James, and the entire Ginsburg family, particularly on this holy day of Rosh Hashanah. According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah we begin a period of reflection. Tonight, we reflect on the legacy of Justice Ginsburg and we honor her belief in creating a fair and just world by recommitting to fight for that justice."	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1466906/statement-by-senator-kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-on-the-passing-of-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg&speechType=6	Government Operations Arts, Entertainment, and History			https://joebiden.com/2020/09/19/statement-by-senator-kamala-harris-and-doug-emhoff-on-the-passing-of-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg/
VSKH23920206	Kamala Harris	2020-09-23	Harris, Casey, Booker, Durbin Urge Finance Committee Leaders to Adopt Proposals to Reduce Maternal Mortality Rate	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) wrote a letter urging the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee to draw on their individually proposed maternal health bills as the committee develops policy recommendations to expand and improve coverage and services for pregnant and post-partum people. Those bills are: Senator Kamala Harris' Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act (S. 3424)Senator Kamala Harris' Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies (CARE) Act (S. 1600)Senator Bob Casey's Improving Coverage and Care for Mother's Act (S. 3443)Senator Cory Booker's Maximizing Outcomes for Moms through Medicaid Improvement and Enhancement of Services (MOMMIES) Act (S. 1343)Senator Richard Durbin's Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness (MOMMA's) Act (S. 916)""Maternal mortality and morbidity is a problem that plagues America and must be confronted. At 17.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, the United States ranks last among similarly situated countries. For Black mothers that rate rises to 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live births. American Indian and Alaskan Native mothers also face their own unique challenges that lead to higher than average maternal mortality rates. This is unacceptable,"" the senators wrote. They continued, ""If done right, this effort can have a truly positive impact and reduce the United States' dismal maternal mortality and morbidity rate."" In their letter to Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR), the Senators highlighted six main areas for improving maternal health rates: Access to coverage: Expand Medicaid coverage for at least one year for post-partum care;Access to services: Increase access to services so pregnant people can receive the full range of health care services and not just pregnancy-related care;Enable non-clinical professionals to provide services: Allow providers including doulas, midwives and lactation consultants to provide services and be reimbursed by Medicaid;Reduce racial disparities in maternal health care: Ensure employees in health care settings receive ongoing, evidence-based anti-racism and bias training;Ensure continuity of maternal health demonstrations: Allow states and communities to create local maternal health projects that the federal government can learn from; andSupport telehealth: Provide resources to help states implement telehealth services for maternity care, especially for those living in rural or underserved areas.The letter is available HERE. ###"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474506/harris-casey-booker-durbin-urge-finance-committee-leaders-to-adopt-proposals-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-rate&speechType=6	Women		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-casey-booker-durbin-urge-finance-committee-leaders-to-adopt-proposals-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-rate-

Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Saturday released the following statement following President Trump's nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States: ""The Supreme Court has a profound impact on the rights of all Americans. As a U.S. Senator and member of the Judiciary Committee, I have a duty to ensure that a Supreme Court nominee will uphold the law and has a demonstrated commitment to equal justice. Americans across the country are already casting votes, and we will soon know the president and senators who will be sworn in next January. We must respect Americans' voices and allow the winners of the election to nominate and confirm the next Supreme Court Justice. ""From day one, President Trump made clear that he had a litmus test for Supreme Court Justices , destroy the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with preexisting conditions and overturn our right to make our own health care decisions. ""President Trump, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans will stop at nothing to destroy the Affordable Care Act's protections for 130 million Americans with preexisting health conditions. The devastating coronavirus pandemic has already killed more than 202,000 Americans, and sickened millions more, yet President Trump is fighting in the Supreme Court right now to strike down the only law guaranteeing Americans can access the health care they need. Republicans are desperate to get Judge Barrett confirmed before the Supreme Court takes up this case in November and millions of Americans will suffer for their power play. ""Just yesterday, I paid my respects to the legendary Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who devoted her life to fighting for Equal Justice Under Law and a more fair and just world. Her passing is devastating, and it would be a travesty to replace her with a justice who is being selected to undo her legacy and erase everything she did for our country. ""I have been proud to represent the people throughout my entire career. With the next Supreme Court Justice set to determine the fate of protections for those with preexisting health conditions, and reproductive health options, I will continue to fight on behalf of the people and strongly oppose the president's nomination."" ###"	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474509/harris-statement-on-supreme-court-nomination&speechType=6	Judicial Branch		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-supreme-court-nomination-
VSKH11020204	Kamala Harris	2020-10-01	Harris, Brown Introduce Heat Stress Legislation to Protect Workers	statement	"WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senators Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) on Thursday introduced legislation to ensure the safety and health of workers who are exposed to dangerous heat conditions in the workplace. The bill, the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, is named in honor of Asunción Valdivia who died in 2004 after picking grapes for ten hours straight in 105-degree temperatures. Mr. Valdivia fell unconscious and instead of calling an ambulance, his employer told Mr. Valdivia's son to drive his father home. On his way home, he died of heat stroke at the age of 53. Mr. Valdivia's death was completely preventable, yet his story is not unique. Representatives Judy Chu (D-CA), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ), and Alma Adams (D-NC) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The bill builds on legislation that Rep. Chu introduced as a member of the California Assembly that made California the first state in the nation to require paid shade and water breaks for those who work outside. Currently, there is no similar federal standard. ""America has a serious and deadly problem of workers laboring in hot conditions without even the most basic protections such as rest breaks and access to water. These dangers are exacerbated right now as workers also face the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and smoke from widespread wildfires,"" said Senator Harris. ""It is absolutely unconscionable that workers in industries from agriculture to construction face excessive heat conditions for hours each day with no protections for their health and safety. I'm proud to introduce this legislation to ensure a more safe workplace for the thousands of workers that our country has come to rely on."" ""Protecting workers from heat stress is essential, particularly as global temperatures continue to rise and extreme weather conditions become more common,"" said Senator Brown. ""Every worker deserves a safe work environment, and this legislation is an important step toward creating national standards and protections that will keep workers safe on the job as the risks of heat stress increase."" Heat-related illnesses can cause heat cramps, organ damage, heat exhaustion, stroke, and even death. Between 1992 and 2017, heat stress injuries killed 815 U.S. workers and seriously injured more than 70,000. Climate change is making the problem worse. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, June 2020 tied at Earth's third hottest June on record. Farmworkers and construction workers suffer the highest incidence of heat illness. And no matter what the weather is outside, workers in factories and other workplaces, including ones where workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE), can face dangerously high heat conditions all year round. The Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act will protect workers against occupational exposure to excessive heat by: Requiring the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to establish an enforceable standard to protect workers in high-heat environments with measures like paid breaks in cool spaces, access to water, limitations on time exposed to heat, and emergency response for workers with heat-related illness; and Directing employers to provide training for their employees on the risk factors that can lead to heat illness, and guidance on the proper procedures for responding to symptoms. In addition to Harris and Brown, co-sponsors of this legislation include Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act has the support of a broad coalition of groups including: United Farm Workers of America, United Farm Worker Foundation, Public Citizen, Farmworker Justice, AFL-CIO, American Public Health Association, Earthjustice, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Migrant Clinicians Network, Migrant Legal Action Program, National Employment Law Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, SEIU, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, UNITE HERE!, United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, and Workers Defense Project. ""This past summer has been deadly for essential workers,"" said Juley Fulcher, Worker Health and Safety Advocate for Public Citizen. ""The combination of coronavirus and extreme heat puts farmworkers, mail carriers, warehouse workers and many others in danger every day they go to their jobs. Workplaces where COVID-19 runs rampant are often the same ones posing the greatest risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Not surprisingly, workers facing this double jeopardy are disproportionately Black and Brown. This summer has been one of the hottest on record , and heat stress will only be getting worse in the years to come. We thank Senators Harris and Brown for their leadership on this crucial bill to hold employers accountable for protecting their workers from heat-related illness and death."" ""Farmworkers perform one of the most arduous and dangerous jobs in the U.S. The current trend toward higher temperatures across the country is expected to accelerate, and with it the health risks posed by extreme heat. The lack of a federal standard to protect workers from heat stress endangers the health and lives of all workers, including farmworkers. Farmworkers should have access to something as basic as a sufficient amount of water, rest, and shade, instead of continuing to suffer tragic and avoidable injury and death,"" said Bruce Goldstein, President, Farmworker Justice. ""As temperatures soar beyond 100 degrees across the U.S., farm workers still lack basic protections from deadly heat such as the right to cold water, shade and rest breaks,"" said Teresa Romero, UFW President. ""Farm workers , who were deemed essential by the federal government during the global pandemic, deserve water, shade, and breaks. The UFW is honored to work alongside Sen. Harris on the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act to enact national heat rules such as those we won in California."" ""Farm workers, who have been at the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, must also face the additional risk of suffering heat illness,"" said Diana Tellefson Torres, Executive Director of the UFW Foundation. ""Farm workers are deemed essential workers but still lack basic labor rights. We need to change that. We are proud to join Sen. Harris in the fight for the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2020 to provide workers the right to access to water, shade, rest breaks and trainings."" ""Senator Harris' bill would provide common sense protections for millions of essential outdoor workers. If passed, it will help prevent avoidable and tragic deaths like Mr. Asunción Valdivia's. Without climate action, extreme heat is and will continue to be a threat to the health of outdoor workers, many of whom are Latino and African American and already experience long-standing systemic health and social inequities,"" said Juan Declet-Barreto, Climate Vulnerability Social Scientist, Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Sen. Harris' bill will help school groundskeepers, park workers, trash collectors, window washers, the thousands of school workers delivering meals to students, and everyone whose work must go on even when temperatures hit 90 degrees. It's time Congress stepped up to protect all essential workers,"" said Mary Kay Henry, President, Service Employees International Union. Bill text is available HERE.

Harris (D-CA) on Friday joined Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in pressing Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) not to proceed with Supreme Court confirmation hearings next week unless stringent COVID-19 testing procedures are implemented immediately. Pointing out that two Judiciary Committee members have tested positive for COVID-19 and others have thus far refused to be tested, the senators told Graham that without testing procedures in place, the hearings could threaten the safety and health of all who attend in person. The senators wrote, ""In the wake of news that Senators Lee and Tillis tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the White House event announcing Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, Judiciary Committee Democrats asked that you postpone her confirmation hearings to ensure that we don't risk the health and safety of fellow Senators, Senate staff, other Senate employees, as well as Judge Barrett and her family. To date, we understand that you plan to proceed with these hearings on October 12, 2020, despite the serious risks they present. We urge you against unsafely moving forward with these hearings while no clear testing regime is in place to ensure that they do not become another super-spreader of this deadly virus."" The senators continued, ""Without these precautionary measures in place, Senators, Senate staff, press, Judge Barrett and her family will face a serious, unnecessary risk of contracting COVID-19. We also have a moral responsibility to protect the workers who make it possible for us to do our jobs in the Senate each and every day. Absent these protocols, you are ignoring CDC best practices and may force Senators to participate in this hearing remotely which, for such a consequential hearing, would be entirely unprecedented.

VSKH121020202	Kamala Harris	2020-10-12	Harris: Republicans Are Rushing Confirmation to Strike Down Affordable Care Act	statement	WASHINGTON, D.C. , U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Monday participated in the hearing to consider the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. Senator Harris spoke out against Senate Republicans' attempt to jam through a nominee who will take away healthcare from millions of Americans, all while our nation is in the midst of a deadly pandemic. In her statement, Harris highlighted that the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the rights she fought to protect are at stake with Judge Barrett's nomination.

And again there is so much more.I believe we must listen to our constituents and protect their access to health care, and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after Americans decide who they want in the White House.A full transcript of Harris' statement, as delivered: HARRIS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This hearing has brought together more than 50 people to sit inside of a closed door room for hours while our nation is facing a deadly airborne virus. This committee has ignored commonsense requests to keep people safe , including not requiring testing for all members , despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee. By contrast, in response to this recent Senate outbreak, the leaders of Senate Republicans rightly postponed business on the Senate floor this week to protect the health and safety of senators and staff. Mr. Chairman, for the same reasons, this hearing should have been postponed. The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facilities workers, janitorial staff, and congressional aides, and Capitol Police at risk. Not to mention, that while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills, the Senate should be prioritizing coronavirus relief and providing financial support to those families. The American people need to have help to make rent or their mortgage payment. We should provide financial assistance to those who have lost their job, and help parents put food on the table. Small businesses need help. As do the cities, towns, and hospitals that this crisis has pushed to the brink. The House bill would help families and small businesses get through this crisis, but Senate Republicans have not lifted a finger for 150 days, which is how long that bill has been here in the Senate, to move the bill. Yet this committee is determined to rush a Supreme Court confirmation hearing through in just 16 days. Senate Republicans have made it crystal clear that rushing a Supreme Court nomination is more important than helping and supporting the American people who are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a devastating economic crisis. Their priorities are not the American people's priorities. But for the moment, Senate Republicans hold the majority in the Senate and determine the schedule, so here we are. The Constitution of the United States entrusts the Senate with the solemn duty to carefully consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Yet the Senate majority is rushing this process and jamming President Trump's nominee through the Senate while people are actually voting. Just 22 days before the end of the election. More than 9 million Americans have already voted and millions more will vote while this illegitimate committee process is underway. A clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill this seat. And my Republican colleagues know that. Yet they are deliberately defying the will of the people in their attempt to roll back the rights and protections provided under the Affordable Care Act. And let's remember: In 2017, President Trump and Congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, but remember people from all walks of life spoke out and demanded Republicans stop trying to take away the American peoples health care. Republicans finally realized the Affordable Care Act is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work. That's why President Trump promised to only nominate judges who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. This administration, with the support of Senate Republicans, will be in front of the Supreme Court on November 10th to argue that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. That's in 29 days that that'll happen. That's a big reason why Senate Republicans are rushing this process. They are trying to get a justice onto the Court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections of the Affordable Care Act. And if they succeed, it will result in millions of people losing access to health care at the worst possible time in the middle of a pandemic. 23 million Americans could lose their health insurance altogether. If they succeed, they will eliminate protections for 135 million Americans with preexisting conditions like diabetes and asthma, heart disease or cancer. A list that now will include over 7 million Americans who have contracted COVID-19. Insurance companies could deny you coverage, or could sell you a plan that won't pay a dime toward treating anything related to your preexisting condition. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, you will have to once again pay for things like mammograms and cancer screenings, and birth control. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. And young adults will be kicked off their parents' plans. And these are not abstract issues. We need to be clear about how overturning of the ACA will impact the people we all represent. For example, Myka, who is eleven years old and she lives in Southern California. So Myka enjoys being a Girl Scout and ice-skating and reading, eating pasta, and baking. Her mother says the only reason Myka is able to live her life as she does now is because the Affordable Care Act guarantees that her health insurance cannot deny her coverage or limit her care because it's too expensive. You see, Myka has a Congenital heart defect. She goes to multiple specialists throughout the year and gets an MRI with anesthesia every six months. At just eleven months old, Myka's family had already hit $50,000 in medical expenses. And her biannual MRI costs $15,000 a session. And so correction: by 11 months old her family had already hit $500,000 in medical expenses. If Republicans succeed in striking down the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will be able to deny coverage to children with serious conditions. Children like Myka. And parents, well, they'll be on their own. No one should face financial ruin to get their child, their spouse, or their parent the care they need. And no family should be kept from seeing a doctor or getting treatment because an insurance company says the treatment is too expensive. In America, access to health care should not be determined based on how much money you have. Health care and access to health care should be a right. Myka and millions of others who are protected by the Affordable Care Act know this is fundamentally what is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. And of course there's more at stake. Throughout our history, Americans have brought cases to the United Sates Supreme Court in the ongoing fight for civil rights, human rights, and equal justice. Decisions like Brown v. Board of Education, which opened up educational opportunities for Black boys and girls, Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's right to control her body. Loving v. Virginia and Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized that love is love, and that marriage equality is the law of the land. The United States Supreme Court is often the last refuge for equal justice when our constitutional rights are being violated. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life to this fight for equal justice. And she defended the constitution. She advocated for human rights and equality. She stood up for the rights of women. She protected workers. She fought for the rights of consumers against big corporations. She supported LGBTQ rights. And she did so much more. But now, her legacy and the rights she fought so hard to protect are in jeopardy. By replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with someone who will undo her legacy, President Trump is attempting to roll back Americans' rights for decades to come. Every American must understand that with this nomination, equal justice under law is at stake. Our voting rights are at stake. Workers' rights are at stake. Consumer rights are at stake. The right to a safe and legal abortion is at stake. And holding corporations accountable is at stake. And again there is so much more. So Mr. Chairman, I do believe this hearing is a clear attempt to jam through a Supreme Court nominee who will take health care away from millions people during a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 214,000 Americans. I believe we must listen to our constituents and protect their access to health care, and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after Americans decide who they want in the White House. Thank you. ###	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1474525/harris-republicans-are-rushing-confirmation-to-strike-down-affordable-care-act&speechType=6	Judicial Branch Health and Health Care		Washington, DC	https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-republicans-are-rushing-confirmation-to-strike-down-affordable-care-act

VSKH261020200	Kamala Harris	2020-10-26	Harris Statement on Confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett	statement	"U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-CA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Monday released the following statement on her vote against the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: ""Senate Republicans jammed through this nomination in the middle of an election where over 60 million Americans have already voted. Senate Republicans have ignored the will of the people, deciding instead to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who devoted her life to fighting for equal justice , with someone who was selected to undo her legacy. ""President Trump repeatedly made clear that he would only nominate judges who would get rid of the Affordable Care Act. President Trump and Senate Republicans are determined to take away health care coverage and protections for people with preexisting conditions. On November 10, Trump administration lawyers will be before the Supreme Court arguing to strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. This is a big reason why Senate Republicans rushed this confirmation. If they succeed, millions of people will lose access to health care in the middle of a devastating pandemic that has killed over 225,000 Americans and sickened millions more. ""The American people see this confirmation for what it is: an illegitimate move that will set our country back for generations. Access to health care is now in jeopardy. Our voting rights are now in jeopardy. Workers' rights are now in jeopardy. LGBTQ equality is now in jeopardy. The right to a safe and legal abortion is now in jeopardy. The ability to address a changing climate is now in jeopardy. And so much more. ""I share the American people's outrage at this rushed process to confirm a nominee who has the potential to do great harm."""	https://votesmart.org/public-statement/1488174/harris-statement-on-confirmation-of-judge-amy-coney-barrett&speechType=6	Judicial Branch Legislative Branch			https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-statement-on-confirmation-of-judge-amy-coney-barrett
