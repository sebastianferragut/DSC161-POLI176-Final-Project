CSPANKH27120190	Kamala Harris	2019-01-27	Senator Kamala Harris Presidential Campaign Launch in Oakland, CA	THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. MY HEART IS FULL RIGHT NOW. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK THE GREAT MAYOR OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE INTRODUCTION AND OUR LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP. OUR MOTHERS WERE FRIENDS ALSO IN OAKLAND. I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP. HERE WE ARE. [LAUGHTER] HERE WE ARE. LET ME TELL YOU, I AM SO PROUD TO BE A DAUGHTER OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS A MOST OF YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN UP THE ROAD AT KAISER HOSPITAL. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS JUST A FEW MILES AWAY THAT MY PARENTS FIRST MET AS GRADUAL , AS GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THEY WERE BORN HALF A WORLD APART FROM EACH OTHER. MY FATHER CAME FROM JAMAICA TO STUDY ECONOMICS. MY MOTHER CAME FROM INDIA TO STUDY SCIENCE. [APPLAUSE] THEY CAME HERE IN PURSUIT OF MORE THAN KNOWLEDGE. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, THEY CAME IN PURSUIT OF A DREAM. THAT DREAM WAS A DREAM FOR THEMSELVES, FOR ME, AND MY SISTER. AS CHILDREN IN THE EAST BAY, WE WERE RAISED BY A COMMUNITY WITH A DEEP BELIEF IN THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTS OF THE PROMISE THAT STILL REMAIN UNFULFILLED. WE WERE RAISED IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE WERE TAUGHT TO SEE A WORLD BEYOND OURSELVES. TO BE CONSCIOUS AND COMPASSIONATE ABOUT THE STRUGGLE OF ALL PEOPLE. WE WERE RAISED TO BELIEVE PUBLIC SERVICE IS A NOBLE CAUSE AND THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IS EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN FACT, MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN, DO SOMETHING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BASICALLY, SHE WAS SAYING, YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND STAND UP AND DO NOT GIVE UP THE FIGHT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS A DEEP ROOTED BELIEF THAT INSPIRED ME TO BECOME A LAWYER AND PROSECUTOR. IT WAS A COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM THIS SPOT 30 YEARS AGO AS A YOUNG DISTRICT ATTORNEY I WALKED INTO THE COURTROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SAID THE FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD GUIDE MY LIFE. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNEW OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS DEEPLY FLAWED. I ALSO KNEW THE PROFOUND IMPACT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ON PEOPLE LIVES. IT'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO GIVE THEM SAFETY AND DIGNITY. I KNEW I WANTED TO PROTECT PEOPLE AND I KNEW THE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WHO ARE MOST OFTEN TARGETED BY PREDATORS ARE ALSO MOST OFTEN THE VOICELESS AND VULNERABLE. I BELIEVE , [CHANTING] ON THAT POINT, I BELIEVE , I BELIEVED THEN AS I DO NOW, NO ONE SHOULD BE LEFT TO FIGHT ALONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, WE BELIEVE A HARM AGAINST ANY OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US. THAT IS WHY WHEN A CASE IS FINAL , IT DOES NOT READ THE NAME OF THE VICTIM, THAT IT READS, THE PEOPLE. THIS IS A POINT I HAVE OFTEN EXPLAINED TO COUNSEL, SURVIVORS OF CRIME, PEOPLE WHO FACE HARM OFTEN AT THE HANDS OF SOMEONE THEY TRUST, BE IT A RELATIVE OR A BANK OR A CORPORATION, I WOULD REMIND THEM, YOU ARE NOT INVISIBLE. WE ALL STAND TOGETHER. THAT IS THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE ONLY HAD ONE CLIENT, THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, A FIGHT NOT JUST AGAINST PREDATORS, BUT A FIGHT AGAINST VIOLENCE AND STIGMA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANS FIGHTING FOR A MORE FAIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN THE PREVENTION AND A REDEMPTION WERE NOT IN THE VOCABULARY OR MINDSET OF MOST DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. WE CREATED AN INITIATIVE TO GIVE JOB TRAINING AND SET OF JAIL TIME FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO HAD BEEN DEFRAUDED BY BANKS AND WERE MOVING THEIR HOMES BY THE MILLIONS IN THE GREAT RECESSION. SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM BIG BANKS, I WITNESSED THE ARROGANCE OF POWER. WEALTHY BANKERS ACCUSING INNOCENT HOMEOWNERS OF FAULT AS IF WALL STREET'S MESS WAS OF THE PEOPLES MAKING. WE WENT AFTER THE FIVE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE U.S. WE $120 BILLION FOR CALIFORNIA. WE PASSED THE STRONGEST ANTI-FORECLOSURE LAW IN THE U.S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DID THAT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANT FIGHTING TRANSNATIONAL GANGS WHO TRAFFIC GUNS AND HUMAN BEINGS. THEY ARE PERSISTENT AND RUTHLESS. ON THE SUBJECT OF TRANSNATIONAL GANGS, LET'S BE CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT'S MEDIEVAL VANITY PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO STOP THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [DRUMMING] IN THE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE, TO HOLD THIS ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE, I HAVE SEEN THE AMAZING SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DURING THE HEALTH CARE FIGHT, I SAW PARENTS AND CHILDREN WITH GRAVE ILLNESSES WALK THE HALLS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS. FAMILIES WHO TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT INCREDIBLE SACRIFICE. THEY CAME TO OUR NATIONS CAPITAL , BELIEVING IF THEIR STORIES WERE HEARD AND IF THEY WERE SEEN, THEIR LEADERS WOULD DO THE RIGHT RING. , RIGHT THING. I SAW THE SAME THING WITH OUR DREAMERS. THEY CAME BY THE THOUSANDS, PLANE, TRAIN, AUTOMOBILE. THEY WERE SLEEPING ON SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM FLOOR. THEY CAME BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE ONLY COUNTRY THEY HAVE EVER KNOWN AT HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MET SURVIVORS WHO SHARE THEIR DEEPEST AND MOST PAINFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WHO TOLD STORIES THEY HAVE NEVER BEFORE REVEALED EVEN TO THEIR CLOSEST LOVED ONES BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IF THEY WERE SEEN, THEIR LEADERS WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND PROTECT THE HIGHER COURT IN OUR LAND. TOGETHER, WE TOOK ON THESE BATTLES AND TO BE SURE WE WON AND WE HAVE LOST. WE HAVE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. WE ARE HERE KNOWING, WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND OUR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ARE UNDER ATTACK AND ON THE LINE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE HERE AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE WE MUST ANSWER A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. WHO ARE WE? WHO ARE WE AS AMERICANS? LET'S ANSWER THAT QUESTION TO THE WORLD AND TO EACH OTHER RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. AMERICA, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS WHO BULLY AND ATTACK THE FREE PRESS AND UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WHITE SUPREMACISTS MARCH AND MURDER IN CHARLOTTESVILLE OR MASSACRE INNOCENT WORSHIPERS IN A PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE CHILDREN IN CAGES CRYING FOR THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS, DON'T YOU DARE CALL THAT BORDER SECURITY. THAT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE LEADERS WHO ATTACK PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND VILIFY PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN BANKERS WHO CRASHED OUR ECONOMY GET BONUSES, BUT THE WORKERS WHO BROUGHT OUR COUNTRY BACK CANNOT EVEN GET A RAISE, THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE BARELY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, WHAT IS THIS ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE? THEIR RESPONSE IS TO TRY AND TAKE HEALTH CARE AWAY FROM MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. [BOOING] THEIR RESPONSE IS TO GIVE AWAY $1 TRILLION TO CORPORATIONS. [BOOING] THEIR RESPONSE IS TO BLAME IMMIGRANTS AS THE SOURCE OF OUR PROBLEMS. [BOOING] LET'S UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING. PEOPLE IN POWER ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE US THE VILLAINS IN OUR AMERICAN STORY IS EACH OTHER. THAT IS NOT OUR STORY. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. THAT IS NOT OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS NOT ABOUT US VERSUS THEM, IT IS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THIS MOMENT, WE MUST ALL SPEAK TROOPS ABOUT , SPEAK TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING, SEEK TRUTH, SPEAK TRUTH, AND FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHALL WE? [LAUGHTER] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. OUR ECONOMY TODAY IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. THE COST OF LIVING IS GOING UP BUT PAYCHECKS ARE NOT KEEPING UP. FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, A DECENT RETIREMENT FEELS OUT OF REACH AND THE AMERICAN DREAM FEELS OUT OF TOUCH. THE TRUTH IS, OUR PEOPLE ARE DROWNING IN DEBT. RECORD STUDENT LOAN DEBT. CAR LOAN DEBT. CREDIT CARD DEBT. RESORTING TO PAYDAY LENDERS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE BILLS. PEOPLE ARE DROWNING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF AMERICANS LIVING WITH A SINKING FEAR THEY WILL NOT DO AS WELL AS THEIR PARENTS. WOMEN ARE PAID ON AVERAGE $.80 ON THE DOLLAR, BLACK WOMAN, $.63, LATINAS, $.53. HERE IS THE THING. WHEN WE LIFT UP THE WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, WE LIFT UP THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY, WE LIFT UP THE FAMILIES OF OUR COUNTRY, AND THE WHOLE SOCIETY AND IF IT'S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK ANOTHER TRUTH. BIG PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE UNLEASHED AN OPIOID CRISIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA COAST TO THE MOUNTAINS OF WEST VIRGINIA, AND PEOPLE, ONCE AND FOR ALL, WE HAVE GOT A CALL DRUG ADDICTION WHAT IT IS , A NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS, FROM WILDFIRES IN THE WEST TO HURRICANES IN THE EAST, TO FLOODS AND DROUGHT IN THE HEARTLAND, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BUY THE LIE. WE ARE GOING TO ACT BASED ON SCIENCE FACT, NOT SCIENCE FICTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK AND UNCOMFORTABLE BUT HONEST TRUTH WITH ONE ANOTHER. RACISM, SEXISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL IN THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TOO MANY BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS ARE BEING LOCKED UP, FROM MASS INCARCERATION, THE CASH BAIL, TO POLICING, OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS DRASTIC REPAIR. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, AMERICA'S POSITION IN THE WORLD HAS NEVER BEEN WEAKER. WHEN DEMOCRATIC VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK AROUND THE GLOBE, WHEN AUTHORITARIANISM IS ON THE MARCH, WHEN NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IS ON THE RISE, WHEN WE HAVE FOREIGN POWERS INVESTING , IN FASTING THE WHITE HOUSE , INFESTING THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE MALWARE , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT OUR CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER. AND LET'S SPEAK THE BIGGEST TRUTH, THE BIGGEST TRUTH OF ALL. IN THE FACE OF POWERFUL FORCES TRYING TO SO HATE , SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONGST US, THE TRUTH IS THAT AS AMERICANS, WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND LET'S NOT BUY THE STUFF THAT SOME FOLKS ARE TRYING TO PEDDLE. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES, WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND IT YOU KNOW, SOME WILL SAY, WE NEED TO SEARCH TO FIND THAT COMMON GROUND. HERE IS WHAT I SAY. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE ALREADY STANDING ON COMMON GROUND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I SAY WE RISE TOGETHER OR WE FALL TOGETHER AS ONE NATION, INDIVISIBLE. AND I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT UNITY FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. HEAR ME OUT. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT UNITY FOR THE SAKE OF UNITY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOME FACADE OF UNITY. AND I BELIEVE WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE WORD UNITY HAS OFTEN BEEN USED TO SHUT PEOPLE UP OR PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AFTER ALL, LET'S REMEMBER, WHEN WOMEN FOUGHT FOR SUFFRAGE, THOSE IN POWER SAID THEY WERE DIVIDING THE SEXES AND DISTURBING THE PEACE. LET'S REMEMBER, WHEN ABOLITIONISTS SPOKE OUT AND CIVIL RIGHTS WORKERS MARCHED, THEIR OPPRESSORS SAID THEY WERE DIVIDING THE RACES AND VIOLATING THE WORD OF GOD. BUT FREDERICK DOUGLASS SAID IT BEST, AND HARRIET TUBMAN AND DR. KING KNEW, TO LOVE THE RELIGION OF JESUS IS TO HATE THE RELIGION OF THE SLAVE MASTER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN WE HAVE TRUE UNITY, NO ONE WILL BE SUBJUGATED FOR OTHERS. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR A COUNTRY WITH EQUAL TREATMENT, COLLECTIVE PURPOSE, AND FREEDOM FOR ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY CLEAR EYED ABOUT THE FIGHT AHEAD AND WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. WITH FAITH IN GOD, WITH FIDELITY TO COUNTRY, AND WITH THE FIGHTING SPIRIT I GOT FROM MY MOTHER , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WILL TELL YOU , I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I LOVE MY COUNTRY, I LOVE MY COUNTRY. I AM RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, AND FOR ALL PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM RUNNING TO FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE THE ECONOMY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. FOR AN AMERICA WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PAY THE BILLS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WILL DELIVER THE LARGEST WORKING AND MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT IN A GENERATION, UP TO $500 PER MONTH TO HELP AMERICA'S FAMILIES MAKE INTIMATE , MAKE END'S MEET. AND WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY REVERSING THIS ADMINISTRATIONS GIVEAWAYS TO THE TOP CORPORATIONS AND TOP 1%. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM RUNNING TO FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE OUR DEMOCRACY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL HONOR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS SO THAT NO ONE WHO HAS SERVED THIS COUNTRY HAS TO WAIT IN LINE FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS TO GET WHAT THEY ARE OWED WHEN THEY RETURN HOME, ON THE FIRST DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AN AMERICA WHERE EVERY PARENT CAN SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL WITHOUT BEING HAUNTED BY THE HORROR OF YET ANOTHER KILLING SPREE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHERE RETREAT ATTACKS ON VOTING RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AS ATTACKS ON OUR COUNTRY ITSELF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AN AMERICA WHERE OUR DAUGHTERS AND OUR SISTERS AND OUR MOTHERS AND OUR GRANDMOTHERS ARE RESPECTED WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHERE THEY WORK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA WHERE WE KEEP OUR WORD, AND WHERE WE HONOR OUR PROMISES, BECAUSE THAT IS OUR AMERICA. AND THAT IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. THAT IS THE AMERICA I KNOW WE BELIEVE IN. AND AS WE EMBARK ON THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I AM NOT PERFECT. LORD KNOWS I AM NOT PERFECT. BUT I WILL ALWAYS SPEAK WITH DECENCY AND MORAL CLARITY, AND TREAT ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL LEAD WITH INTEGRITY AND I WILL SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND, OF COURSE, WE KNOW THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY, GUYS. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. AND WE KNOW WHAT THE DOUBTERS WILL SAY. IT IS THE SAME THING THEY HAVE ALWAYS SAID. THEY WILL SAY, IT'S NOT YOUR TIME. THEY WILL SAY, WAIT YOUR TURN. THEY WILL SAY, THE ODDS ARE LONG. THEY WILL SAY, IT CAN'T BE DONE. BUT AMERICA'S STORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE WHAT CAN BE, I'M BURDENED , UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THAT IS OUR STORY. THAT IS OUR STORY. AND AS ROBERT KENNEDY MANY YEARS AGO SAID, ONLY THOSE WHO DARE TO FAIL GREATLY CAN EVER ACHIEVE GREATLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE ALSO SAID, I DO NOT LIGHTLY DISMISS THE DANGERS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF CHALLENGING AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. BUT THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY TIMES, AND THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY ELECTION. HE SAID, AT STAKE IS NOT SIMPLY THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR PARTY AND EVEN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS OUR RIGHT TO MORAL LEADERSHIP OF THIS PLANET. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO TODAY I SAY TO YOU, MY FRIENDS, THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY TIMES AND THIS WILL NOT BE AN ORDINARY ELECTION. BUT THIS IS OUR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SO HERE IS THE THING, IT IS UP TO US, IT IS UP TO US, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. SO LET'S REMEMBER, IN THIS FIGHT, WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE CAN ACHIEVE THE DREAMS OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. WE CAN HEAL OUR NATION. WE CAN GIVE OUR CHILDREN THE FUTURE THEY DESERVE. WE CAN RECLAIM THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EVERY, SINGLE PERSON IN OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERS] AND LET'S DO IT TOGETHER, AND LET'S START NOW, AND I THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

CSPANKH18220191	Kamala Harris	2019-02-18	Senator Kamala Harris Town Hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire	HI, EVERYONE. HI! IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU! IT'S GREAT TO BE IN THE GRANITE STATE! THANK YOU, GUYS! ALL RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE A WHILE. THANK YOU, MADAM SPEAKER. I CALLED TERRY BEFORE MY VISIT TO JUST CHECK IN AND GET SOME ADVICE AND COUNSEL. YOU HAVE BEEN A TRAIL BLAZER IN YOUR CAREER AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR ROLE OF LEAPER , LEADERSHIP AND FOR INTRODUCING ME THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S A HOLIDAY. IT IS SNOWING OUTSIDE AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR TIME BUT THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN TO SPEND IT BEING HERE MEANS THE WORLD TO ME AND OBVIOUSLY IS A REFLECTION OF THE LEADERS WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM AND HOW MUCH WE ALL CARE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY SO I THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I JUST ARRIVED THIS MORNING AND THE PRESS , I DID A COUPLE OF, LIKE THEY CALL IT A GAGGLE. A COUPLE OF PRESS INTERVIEWS. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS, I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM. [LAUGHTER] GET THE ELEPHANTS OUT OF THE ROOM. I INTEND TO COMPETE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I INTEND TO SPEND TIME HERE. I INTEND TO SHAKE EVERY HAND THAT I POSSIBLY CAN. I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU. I WANT TO LISTEN TO YOU. I WANT TO BE CHALLENGED BY YOU. I WANT TO ENSURE THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE ARE RELEVANT AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WILL BE ACHIEVED IS BY SPENDING TIME WITH LEADERS SUCH AS THOSE IN THIS CHURCH AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MANY CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN DEPTH SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU I PLAN ON SPENDING TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I PLAN ON COMPETING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I PLAN ON DOING VERY WELL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] SO THAT IS MY INTENTION. AND I AM GOING TO WORK TOWARD IT. SO I AM HERE TO LISTEN, NOT EVEN MORE THAN I INTEND TO TALK BUT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A FEW THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR A CONVERSATION AND TAKE QUESTIONS. WE ANNOUNCED THIS CAMPAIGN JUST A LITTLE OVER THREE WEEKS AGO, IN MY HOME TOWN OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME, WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? SO I'LL TELL YOU. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE, I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. AND I KNOW WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF. I KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, THE VALUES, THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED AND I'M PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR THOSE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT AN AMERICA TODAY WHERE AMERICAN VALUES AND THE AMERICAN DREAM ARE UNDER ATTACK AND WE HAVE GOT TO STAND TO DEFEND THOSE DREAMS AND IDEALS AND VALUES. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME TO RESTORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST A FEW, NOT JUST THE TOP 1%, NOT JUST BIG CORPORATIONS, BUT EVERYONE. AND RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY WE ARE LOOKING AT EXTREME INEQUITIES AND WE HAVE TO CORRECT COURSE AND I GUESS THE FINAL PLAN IS THERE. MY SISTER AND I , SHE'S HERE, MAYA. WE WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO, WHEN WE'D COME HOME AND TALK ABOUT THIS HAPPENED OR THIS PROBLEM AND COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, THE FIRST THING SHE'D SAY IS, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] SO THERE YOU GO. SO IT IS A TIME TO RESTORE TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. MANY OF YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND INCLUDES, AND THE SPEAKER TOLD YOU PART OF MY BACKGROUND WAS I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR MANY YEARS. I PROSECUTED EVERYTHING INCLUDING HOMICIDES. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME TO RESTORE TRUTH AND JUSTICE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. IT'S AN INFLECTION POINT. WE'RE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY IN THE WORLD. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING EACH OF US AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN A MIRROR AND ASK THIS QUESTION , WHO ARE WE? AND I BELIEVE PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT FOR THOSE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THAT WORD "JUSTICE." SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SEE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN. IT IS NOT JUSTICE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU GIVE A ONE TRILLION DOLLARS TAX CREDIT TO THE TOP 1% AND THE BIG CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. THAT IS NOT JUSTICE. IT IS NOT JUSTICE WHEN WE SEPARATE BABIES FROM THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AT THE BORDER. [APPLAUSE] AND CLAIM , AND CLAIM THAT THAT'S ABOUT BORDER SECURITY WHEN, IN FACT, WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. IT IS NOT JUSTICE, IN A COUNTRY THAT , THAT VALUES CIVIL SOCIETY, THAT WE DO NOT PASS GUN SAFETY LAWS BECAUSE OF FEAR OF LOBBYISTS , [CHEERING] INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR VALUES SHOULD BE ABOUT PROTECTING OUR BABIES WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL, PROTECTING PEOPLE WHERE THEY WORSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE SHOULD NEVER BOW DOWN TO THOSE WHO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID THAT WE MAY NOT WIN RE-ELECTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE DYING IN OUR STREETS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE. TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTH. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE ALL KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO RIGHTLY ARE FEELING QUITE DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AND LEADERS AND THE THING ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS THIS. THE VERY NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS SUCH THAT IT IS A RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUST IS TRUTH. BUT THERE IS A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. SPEAKING TRUTH OFTEN MAKES PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THESE MICROPHONES AND STAND BEHIND PODIUMS, THERE IS AN INCENTIVE THAT WHEN WE SPEAK, EVERYONE WILL FEEL LOVELY AND THEY WILL APPLAUD AND SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST ALL OVER THE ROOM, AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE HAD A GOOD DAY. SPEAKING TRUTH DOESN'T ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. HERE IS THE OTHER THING WHICH WE ALL KNOW. PEOPLE MAY WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION THINKING, I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT I HAD TO HEAR. PEOPLE WILL ALSO WALK AWAY KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION. SO LET'S SPEAK SOME TRUTHS. AS WE ATTEMPT TO RESTORE TRUST. YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE KNOW THAT ALMOST HALF OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY, THAT IT WILL PULL THEM IN A SPIRAL, WE KNOW WE MUST SPEAK TRUTH THAT AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. WHEN WE KNOW THAT IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, IN DO NOT , IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES OF THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR A FULL BEDROOM APARTMENT. [APPLAUSE] WE KNOW AMERICA IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHY I PROPOSE WE CHANGE THE TAX CODE TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND IN PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO WORKING FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, I PROPOSE A TAX CREDIT THAT THEY GET TO COLLECT $500 A MONTH TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO WALK AROUND TOUTING THE ECONOMY IS GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THIS COUNTRY TALKING TO FOLKS. I AM MEETING FOLKS WHO SAY, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS, I AM WORKING. I AM WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS. MY WAGES AREN'T MEETING THE COST OF LIVING, GAS, RENT, UTILITIES. WE HAVE GOT TO SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT EDUCATION. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. NOT SO MUCH OF THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S AGREE. [APPLAUSE] THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO PUT THE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INSTEAD WE ARE PUTTING TONS OF MONEY INTO A SYSTEM OF MASS INCARCERATION. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] BECAUSE WE ARE NOT BEING SMART ABOUT INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT PUTS IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT TALKS MORE ABOUT GRIZZLY BEARS THAN CHILDREN WHO NEEDS (music) RESOURCES. AND IS TRYING TO PRIVATIZE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, MANY IF NOT MOST AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE JUST SHORT OF BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO PAY A HOSPITAL BILL. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. AND THAT THE TRUTH ALSO IS HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE A PRIVILEGE, IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IF CHARLOTTESVILLE DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, IF THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE DID NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANSFORMING A , TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL. LET'S SPEAK THESE TRUTHS SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THEM. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND LET'S SPEAK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTHS THAT THIS TIME MUST BE SPOKEN WHEN WE HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FORCES THAT ARE TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTH I BELIEVE WE MUST KNOW IN OUR HEADS AND HEARTS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] AND I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. WE ARE A BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSE COUNTRY. LOOK AT THE WEATHER OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW AND IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE IN HAWAII RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIVERSITY, OF RELIGION AND RACE AND ETHNICITY AT TOPOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRY GREW WE COULD GO ON AND ON WE ARE A BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSE COUNTRY. SOME WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITHIN DIVERSITY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE UNITY. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENCES. HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE UNITY. I WILL TO YOU THIS. THE WAY WE ACHIEVE UNITY IS MY UNDERSTANDING YES, WE ARE DIVERSE AND HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT SOME OF US CALL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THOUGHT. OTHERS THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. THE WITCHING HOUR, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP WITH THAT THING THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU IN A COLD SWEAT, FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP, HAD THAT MOMENT THINKING THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WAITING ON US, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME DEMOGRAPHIC A POLLSTER PUT US IN. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF VERY FEW THINGS, PERSONAL HEALTH, THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN, PARENTS. FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, CAN I KEEP A JOB, PAY THE BILLS, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY? FOR SO MANY PARENTS, CAN I GET MY CHILD ACCESS TO TREATMENT FOR THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? FOR SO MANY STUDENTS, CAN I PAY OFF THOSE STUDENT LOANS? THE MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AS WE GO FORWARD AND FIGHT THIS GOOD FIGHT, LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT. LET'S NOT LET ANYONE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM US. [APPLAUSE] AND LET'S REMEMBER OUR STRENGTHS AS A NATION. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT THAT HAS HAPPENED THAT HAS CAUSED US TO SHOUT AT THE TV, THROW THINGS, INDIVIDUAL GROUP THERAPY. [LAUGHTER] BUT LET'S HOLD ON TO SOMETHING. LET'S HOLD ON TO AN IMAGE I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT I HAVE WITNESSED IN , I HAVE BEEN IN THE SENATE TWO YEARS. MY OFFICE IS IN THE HRART BUILDING ON THE FIRST FLOOR. I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF DREAMERS DESCEND ON OUR NATIONS CAPITAL TRAVELING BY BUS, TRAIN, CAR, SLEEPING I AM SURE 10 DEEP ON SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM FLOOR, MERGING THE HALLS OF CONGRESS BELIEVING THAT IF THEY ARE SEEN AND THEIR STORIES HEARD, IT WILL MATTER. I HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING WITH THESE TEENAGERS FROM PARKLAND AND THEIR PARENTS TRAVELING, MERGING. REQUIRING , MARCHING, REQUIRING PEOPLE TO SEE AND HEAR THEM. I SAW IT WITH PARENTS WHO CAME WITH CHILDREN TO FIGHT DURING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHO BROUGHT CHILDREN AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF DISABILITY, FAMILIES FOR WHOM IT IS AN EFFORT TO MOVE THE CHILD FROM ONE ROOM OF THE HOUSE TO ANOTHER. TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WALKING THOSE HOLES, BELIEVING IF THEY WERE SEEN AND THEIR STORIES HEARD, IT WOULD MATTER. I TALKED WITH SURVIVORS AROUND THE KAVANAUGH HEARING WHO BY THE HUNDREDS, MOST OF WHOM HAD NEVER TOLD THEIR STORY TO ANYONE AND HAD THE COURAGE AND THE CONVICTION TO TRAVEL TO OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, BELIEVING IF THEY WERE HEARD, IT WOULDN'T , IT WOULD MATTER. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER IN THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. CONVICTION AND HOPEFULNESS. WE CANNOT LOSE THAT. WE MUST HOLD ON TO THAT AS WE GO FORWARD TO 2020. WE MUST REMEMBER WE ARE A NATION THAT PART OF OUR STRENGTH IS THOSE PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED, THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE WRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE IDEALS BEHIND THOSE WORDS WE HAVE SPOKEN IN 1776 THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUALS. PART OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION IS WE WERE FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS AND WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE. WE ARE AN ASPIRATIONAL NATION. LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NOT MET THOSE IDEALS. WE KNOW THAT. BUT OUR NATURE IS TO FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THEM. WE CANNOT LOSE THAT ASPIRATIONAL NATURE BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF OUR STRENGTH. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS MOMENT, THAT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND WHO WE ARE. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS, AND THEN QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS, WHATEVER ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SAY. YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, THEY WILL LOOK IN EACH OF OUR EYES. YOU MAY LOOK IN SOMEBODY'S EYES. THEY WILL LOOK, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, AND THEY WILL ASK US WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT INFLECTION MOMENT? WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY IS WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THIS CHURCH TOGETHER AND OUR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH MORE THAN HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT. OUR ANSWER WILL BE WHAT WE DID, WHAT ACTION WE TOOK THAT WE STOOD UP, STOOD OUT, WE STOOD UP, MARCHED, SHOUTED, DID EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. [APPLAUSE] OK, QUESTIONS?	https://www.c-span.org/video/?457973-1/senator-kamala-harris-town-hall-portsmouth-hampshire	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) held a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to talk about health care, immigration, climate change, and efforts to prevent gun violence.

CSPANKH19220192	Kamala Harris	2019-02-19	Politics and Eggs Breakfast with Senator Kamala Harris	SO THIS IS MY FIRST OFFICIAL TRIP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DURING OUR TIME HERE YESTERDAY I STARTED THE DAY HAVING MANY INTERVIEWS AND ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED AS I'M BRINGING THIS UP AND I WANT TO GET THIS OFF THE TABLE, DO YOU PLAN ON SPENDING ANY TIME HERE, ARE YOU GOING TO COMPETE HERE? I WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW I PLAN ON COMPETING HARD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. [APPLAUSE] AND I PLAN ON DOING WELL HERE. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WHEN WE RUN THIS ELECTION AND WHEN WE RUN OUR CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY THAT WE NOT ONLY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF THE INTENTION TO WIN BUT FRANKLY THE WAY THAT I WILL MEASURE OUR SUCCESS IS NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THAT OF THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. THE ONLY WAY I THINK TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE RELEVANT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPENDING TIME WITH LEADERS AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE INFORMED, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, WHO CARE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I PERSONALLY SPEND TIME IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I'M BEING CHALLENGED AND WHERE I'M LISTENING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN I TALKED. SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I'M SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN BEAUTIFUL STATE AND I APPRECIATE AND THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO FAR. SO I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET INTO A GROUP CONVERSATION AND BEGIN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PART OF THIS MORNING. BUT AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, I AM A CAREER PROSECUTOR BY MOST OF MY CAREER. I WAS BORN IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. A DAUGHTER OF TWO PARTICIPANTS , PARENTS WHO ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THERE. SO MY SISTER MIA AND I, MY SISTER IS HERE, WE GREW THAT UP WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND AMONG THE HEROES, OF COURSE, THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WERE THE LAWYERS. THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SCHOOL OF THE PROFESSION AS LAW. TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND TO DO THE WORK THAT WE MUST BE DONE OF REMINDING OF GREAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776. WE ARE ALL AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. AT A YOUNG AGE I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER AND I WENT TO HOWARD AS JIM SHARED WITH YOU, AND RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL I JOINED THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH HAS REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE YEARS BEFORE EARL WARREN RAN THAT OFFICE. WHEN I DECIDED TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE THAT QUESTIONED THAT DECISION. MY SISTER WENT TO RUN ACLU. BUT WHAT I SAID THEN AND WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER AS PROSECUTOR , I WAS A COURTROOM TRIAL LAWYER, I PROSECUTED EVERYTHING INCLUDING HOMICIDE CASES. I WAS THE ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF A MAJOR CITY. I WENT ON TO BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MY STATE. WHAT I MAINTAIN TODAY AFTER A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER PROSECUTOR IS THIS, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS A PROFOUND AND DIRECT IMPACT ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING PEOPLE SAFETY, TO GIVE THEM DIGNITY. I ALSO BELIEVE HAVING KNOWN THE SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR REFORM OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THAT AS WELL. AND SO OF THE MANY PRIORITIES THAT I HAVE IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF THE VOTERS WILL HAVE ME AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ONE OF THEM WILL BE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SMARTER AROUND WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, SO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AND WILL ENJOY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THAT. I ALSO BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DISTRUSTFUL OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS AND ITS LEADERS, AND WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL AS WE GO FORWARD . THE NATURE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUST IS SUCH THAT IT IS RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS IN TRUST IS TRUTH. BUT THERE'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. AND AS ROOM OF LEADERS WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH IS SPEAKING TRUTH CAN OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. WHEN YOU STAND BEHIND MICROPHONES LIKE THIS AND YOU'RE AT A PODIUM LIKE THIS THERE'S INCENTIVE THAT WHEN WE SEEK THE , WE SPEAK THE CROWD AND EVERYONE WILL FEEL LOVELY AND SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST IN THE ROOM AND THE JOB WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. SPEAKING TRUTH DOES NOT ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH IS THIS. YES, PEOPLE WILL WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION SAYING I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE WHAT I HAD TO HEAR BUT THEY'LL ALSO WALK AWAY FROM THAT CONVERSATION KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION . AND AS WE PROCEED IN THIS CAMPAIGN YEAR I BELIEVE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS LEADERS WE SPEAK TRUTH WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT OFFENDING OUR , OR MAKING PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT WITH THE PURPOSE OF DEALING WITH ISSUES AND INSPIRING TRUST AMONG THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. SO IN THAT CONTEXT I WILL MENTION A FEW ISSUES THAT I THINK NEED TO BE SPOKEN AND A WAY THAT'S ABOUT THE TRUTH. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. THE ECONOMY IN AMERICA TODAY IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I SAY , THAT. I SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA, THE FACTS THAT TELL US THAT ALMOST HALF OF AMERICAN FAMILIES TODAY CANNOT AFFORD A $400 EMERGENCY OR UNINFECTED EXPENSE. , UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. THAT $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE THAT THE CAR BREAKS DOWN, MEDICAL BILL THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WILL CAUSE THEM TO LOSE THEIR FOOTING OR GOING TO FINANCIAL SPIRAL. THAT'S A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY IS THAT IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES, IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD MARKET RATE FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. THAT IS A FACT IN AMERICA TODAY. SO THIS DISCUSSION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS NOT ABOUT SAYING, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HARD AND GAINED SUCCESS TO BE VILIFIED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I APPLAUD THAT. THAT'S PURSUIT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE AND IF WE HAVE HONEST CONVERSATION WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE RULES AREN'T APPLYING EQUALLY TO ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY HAD EQUAL ACCESS TO A PATH TOWARDS SUCCESS AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CORRECT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE, I PROPOSE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILIES THAT ARE MAKING LESS THAN $100,000, THE FAMILY IS MAKING LESS THAN A $100,000 A YEAR, I'M PROPOSING THAT WE CHANGE OUR TAX CODE TO GIVE THOSE FAMILIES UP TO A $6,000 TAX CREDIT THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE A $500 A MONTH. SO THEY CAN MEET THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL SAY THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY TODAY THAT IT'S GREAT, IT'S GREAT. WELL, NOT SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK, HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE GREATNESS OF THE ECONOMY? AND PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. WELL, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY. YEAH, PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT ABOUT WAGES. WAGES FOR THE MOST PART REMAIN STAGNANT WHILE THE COST OF LIVING, TUITION, GAS, HOUSING KEEPS GOING UP. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE TRUTHS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S SOME COURSE CORRECTION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO ON THE SUBJECT OF RENTERS, FOR EXAMPLE, I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ISSUE HERE. THE OTHER PROPOSAL THAT I OFFER IS THAT IF A RENTER IS PAYING MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME IN RENT PLUS UTILITIES, THAT THEY GET A TAX CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE COST OF THEIR RENT. SO THAT'S A SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LONGER AND MORE IN-DEPTH CONVERSATION THERE. ON THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION, LET'S SPEAK THE TRUTH. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION BUT NOT SO MUCH THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. LET'S LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE WE HAVE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR MOST OF OUR CHILDREN. AND WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT. WE WILL HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES AND, AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY. I'VE MET TEACHERS WHO ARE WORKING TWO JOBS, SOMETIMES THREE TO NOT ONLY PAY THE BILL BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING OUT OF POCKET ON A CONSISTENT BASIS TO PAY FOR THE TOOLS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOM TO ACTUALLY BE EDUCATED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PUTTING THE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WE SHOULD. I WILL TELL YOU MY PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS IS VAST. MY FIRST-GRADE TEACHER, MRS. FRANCES, GOD REST HER SOUL ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL , GRADUATION. IT WAS A TIME IN AMERICA WHERE WE WERE PAYING PUBLIC TEACHERS THEIR VALUE. UNDERSTANDING THAT IN ADDITION TO PARENTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE , RAISING OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR TEACHERS AND WE MUST GIVE THEM THE VALUE OF WHAT THEY ARE GIVING US IN RETURN. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK MORE TRUTH. CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S REAL. IT'S REAL. AND IT IS POSING EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS HUMAN BEINGS AND WE MUST NOT ONLY TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, WE MUST HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS. I WAS IN PORTSMOUTH YESTERDAY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE IN TERMS OF DECLINE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DECLINE, WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT WILL BE UNDER WATER. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED AT THE UNITED STATES SENATE I WAS , WELL, I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I'M ON SEVERAL COMMITTEES. I'M ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. I'M HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND I'M ON JUDICIARY AND I'M ON BUDGET. IN ADDITION, WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE I WAS IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC WORKS. SO I SAT IN HEARINGS WHERE I KID YOU NOT, ONE OF THE HEARINGS WE HAD, THE PREMISE OF THE HEARING WAS ESSENTIALLY TO SCIENCE THE BASIS OF PUBLIC POLICY. FURTHER BACKGROUND ABOUT ME. MY SISTER AND I WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. MY MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER AND SHE HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE. TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS AND END BREAST CANCER. WE SHOULD TAKE US TO THE LAB WITH HER. WE WOULD GO AFTER SCHOOL ON WEEKENDS. I GREW UP AROUND THE PEOPLE WHO THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE FOR BEING WAS TO USE RESEARCH AND FACTS AND SCIENCE IN A WAY THAT COULD IMPROVE HUMAN CONDITION. AND WE RIGHT NOW ARE IN A SITUATION, HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION WHO HAS AMERICAN PUBLIC BUY SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT, TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. [APPLAUSE] TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. AND YOU KNOW, I JOKE ABOUT IT ON THIS ISSUE. LOOK, I CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ANY PARTICULAR DESIRE TO HUG A TREE , BUT I HAVE A VERY STRONG DESIRE TO HUG A HEALTHY BABY. AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THIS IS A MATTER THAT INCLUDES WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR. LET'S TALK TRUTH AND FACTS. LET'S LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT, AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY LEADERS IN BUSINESS HERE, WHETHER WE ARE PREPARED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. LET'S TALK TRUTH. OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS IT IS PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED AND AGREED UPON THAT OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS UP TO 40% OF THE JOBS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WILL NO LONGER EXIST. WE HAVE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT AUTOMATION IS REAL. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE IN THE MIX OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIXED OF AN INDUSTRIAL , MIDSST OF AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. WE HAVE TO SPEAK TRUTH THAT WE ARE NOT EQUIPPING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE , AGREE WITH PART OF WHO WE ARE CULTURALLY WHICH IS HARD-WORKING , HARD WORK IS GOOD WORK. BUT YET WE AS LEADERS ARE NOT PREPARING THE WORKFORCE OF AMERICA FOR THE JOBS OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THERE'S A LIST THAT CAME OUT FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS MID-LAST YEAR THAT PROJECTS THE 20 JOBS BETWEEN 2016 AND 2026 THAT WILL SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH. I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS LIST. SHE IS ABOUT TO START TALKING ABOUT THAT LIST. YES, I AM. SO I'M GOING TO NOW GET INTO AN INTERACTIVE MOMENT IF YOU GIVE THE DACHSHUND TILDE ME FOR A MOMENT. THE 20 JOBS THAT WILL SEE THE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. I WILL TAKE TWO GUESSES, JIM, OK. GUESS WHAT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO ARE. YES? SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THERE ARE A LOT THAT RELATE TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT'S NOT THAT, THAT'S NOT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. YES, IN THE BACK. I KID YOU NOT. YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON. YES, TECHNOLOGY JOBS OR THEY'LL GUESS RIGHTLY BECAUSE MOST JOBS RELATE TO PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE ALSO HAVE AN AGING POPULATION. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO, INSTALLATION OF MAINTENANCE OF SOLAR PANELS AND WIND TURBINES. SO, RIGHT, RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS IS PART OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO. THE REASON THOSE JOBS ARE ON OUR LIST IS BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP WHERE A JOB THAT NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED FOR WHICH WE DON'T HAVE THE SKILL ED LABOR. HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR COUNTRY TO PREPARE OUR WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT HAS GOT TO INCLUDE AS PART OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT CONVERSATION THE PRIVATE SECTOR? WHAT JOBS DO YOU NEED PERFORMED? WHAT ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THAT JOB? IT HAS TO INCLUDE OUR EDUCATORS, THERE'S SO MANY IN THIS ROOM. ARE WE AS GOVERNMENT LEADERS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT IS HAPPENING IN AN HONEST WAY? INCLUDING OUR LABOR LEADERS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WAS TALKING WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING TRADES ABOUT THIS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEY SAID. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE NEW SKILLS THAT ARE INVOLVED, THAT'S GOOD-OLD FASHION WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOREVER. PIPE FITTING, ELECTRICIANS, WELDERS. RIGHT QUESTION MARK , RIGHT. SO THE TRUTH, I WILL NOW END MY ISSUE SPOTTING. THERE ARE SEMI TRUTHS THAT WE MUST SPEAK RIGHT NOW. I WILL SAY THIS I REMAIN VERY , OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF AND WHERE WE WILL GO. I BELIEVE AND I KNOW WE ALL DO, THIS IS A ROOM FULL OF LEADERS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEAS. , IDEALS. WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEALS THAT WERE BEHIND AND INFORMED THE WRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THE IDEA THAT WERE BEHIND THOSE WORDS IN 1776 THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS EQUAL. PART OF OUR STRENGTH AS A NATION IS WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THOSE IDEALS. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NEVER QUITE REACHED THOSE IDEALS BUT OUR STRENGTH IS , THAT WE FIGHT TO REACH THOSE IDEALS. AND THIS IS THE MOMENT IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE MUST KEEP FIGHTING KNOWING THAT THESE ARE NOBLE IDEALS, KNOWING THAT IS PART OF OUR STRENGTH AND PURPOSE AND JUST THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE. SO I THINK OF THIS AS BEING AN EXCITING MOMENT IN TIME AND I'M HONORED THAT YOU ALL HAVE FROM YOUR BUSY LIVES IN YOUR COMMITMENTS CHOSEN TO SPEND THE MORNING WITH ME. I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM YOU. [APPLAUSE]	https://www.c-span.org/video/?457898-1/politics-eggs-breakfast-senator-kamala-harris	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 presidential candidate, spoke at a Saint Anselm College &ldquo;Politics and Eggs&rdquo; breakfast in Manchester, New Hampshire.

CSPANKH23420193	Kamala Harris	2019-04-23	Senator Kamala Harris Town Hall in Hanover, New Hampshire	WHAT 'S UP, DARTMOUTH? IT IS SO GREAT TO BE WITH YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR VOICE, AND I AM VERY HONORED YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US THIS AFTERNOON TO INTRODUCE ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I SPOKE TO A FEW OF THE FOLKS OUTSIDE, THE FIRE MARSHAL, LUCKY US. SPEAKING TO THE FOLKS OUTSIDE, ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID IS, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, I THINK SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES WE HAVE MADE, SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE HAVE MADE AN OUR MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND JUST PROGRESS , IN OUR MOVEMENT TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND JUST PROGRESS HAS BEEN PROMPTED AND FUELED BY THE STUDENTS OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND, YET AGAIN, YOU'RE DOING IT. YOU ARE DOING IT. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH. I OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY BACK IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. I JOKE, ME AND MY SISTER JOKE WE GREW UP BY A GROUP OF ADULTS THAT WERE , SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING. YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU GUYS. [LAUGHTER] AND THAT IS HOW THE CYCLE CONTINUES. I AM SO HAPPY TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY. THE LEADERS WHO WERE IN THE ROOM OF EVERY AGE, THANK YOU FOR THIS. I WILL SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN AND WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND THEN WE WILL PASS AROUND THE MIC, BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE. I TELL YOU I FULLY INTEND TO WIN THIS ELECTION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT, A MEASURE OF SUCCESS FOR ME IS ALSO THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS, THAT WE WILL BE RELEVANT, AND RELEVANT IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS I BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE LISTEN AS MUCH AS WE TALK , MORE THAN WE TALK. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU JUST A LITTLE OF MY THOUGHTS. WE ANNOUNCED OUR CAMPAIGN SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN THE PLACE OF MY BIRTH, OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. WE WERE HOPING WE WOULD HAVE A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ABOUT 22,000 OVER FRIENDS SHOWED UP , OF OUR FRIENDS SHOWED UP, THAT WAS KIND OF NICE. DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROCESS, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING , WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? SO I SHARE WITH THEM A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE OF THEM HAS TO DO WITH WHAT I THINK EVERYONE HERE KNOWS. WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING EACH INDIVIDUAL, AND COLLECTIVELY, TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING , WHO ARE WE? I THINK WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS THAT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] SO, THIS IS A MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRING US THEN TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. I THINK OF THIS ALSO AS BEING A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE A LEADER MUST FIGHT TO RESTORE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS I AM RUNNING. I GUESS A VERY PERSONAL REASON IS, MY SISTER AND I WERE RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO WAS FIVE FEET TALL, BUT IF YOU HAD EVER MET HER, YOU WOULD THINK SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL. OUR MOTHER WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO IF YOU OVERCAME A , CAME HOME , IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, SHE WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?" SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] THERE YOU GO. [APPLAUSE] SO, LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE. CERTAINLY IN THESE LAST TWO YEARS AND SEVERAL MONTHS, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TRUTH, MOSTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF TRUTH VERSUS UNTRHT , UNTRUTH. BUT I ASK WE ALSO CONSIDER ANOTHER CONTEXT, WHICH IS THIS. RIGHT NOW IN OUR COUNTRY, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO RIGHTLY FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF DISTRESSED , DISTRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT, ITS INSTITUTIONS, AND LEADERS. THE THING ABOUT RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST, IS BY ITS VERY NATURE, A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST IS RECIPROCAL. YOU GIVE AND YOU RECEIVE TRUST. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS OF TRUST IS THE TRUTH. BUT THERE IS A FUNNY THING ABOUT TRUTH. SPEAKING TRUTH CAN OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO SPEAK OFTEN BEHIND A MICROPHONE ARE BEHIND A PODIUM, THERE IS AN INCENTIVE THAT WE WILL ENGAGE IN. WE WILL MAKE EVERYONE FEEL LOVELY, SPRINKLE LOVELY DUST ALL OVER THE ROOM, PEOPLE WILL APPLAUD IN THE JOB WILL HAVE BEEN DONE. WHILE SPEAKING TRUTH, DOESN'T ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. HERE IS THE OTHER THING ABOUT SPEAKING TRUTH , YES, PEOPLE MAY WALK AWAY FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THINKING THEY DID NOT LIKE PARTICULARLY WHAT I'D HAD TO HEAR, BUT THEY WILL ALSO WALK FROM THE , WALK AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATION KNOWING IT WAS AN HONEST CONVERSATION. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE MUST SPEAK TRUTH. SO NOW, YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT ME, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TRUTHS YOU HAD IN MIND? I WILL SHARE A FEW WITH YOU. IF CHARLOTTESVILLE DIDN'T MAKE IT CLEAR, IF THE TREE OF LIFE SYNAGOGUE COULD NOT MAKE IT CLEAR, RACISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, TRANS-PHOBIA ARE REAL IN THIS COUNTRY, AND WE MUST SPEAK THESE TRUTHS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND, IN SPEAKING THAT TRUTH, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE BORN OUT OF HATE, HATE WHICH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS RECEIVED NEW FUEL. WE MUST AGREE THAT WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THAT HATE PRESENTS ITSELF, WE MUST ALL SPEAK OUT, SPEAK UP, AND WE MUST AGREE THAT WHOEVER IS THE TARGET OF THAT HATE, THEY SHOULD NEVER BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. THE ECONOMY OF AMERICA IS NOT WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? WELL, IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, ALMOST HALF OF AMERICAN FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. $400. THAT COULD BE THE CAR BREAKING DOWN, A HOSPITAL BILL, $400 UNEXPECTED WILL COMPLETELY TOPPLE THAT FAMILY. IN AMERICAN TODAY , IN AMERICA TODAY, IN 90% OF THE COUNTIES IN OUR COUNTRY, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER FOR WORKING , WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN APARTMENT. AND OUR COUNTRY LAST YEAR, 12 MILLION PEOPLE BORROWED ON AVERAGE $400 FROM THE PAYDAY LENDER AT AN INTEREST RATE OFTEN ABOVE 300%. THESE ARE THE TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, WHICH IS WHY AS 300%. PRESIDENT, I WILL REFORM THE TAX CODE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I PROPOSE IS THAT FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, THEY WILL RECEIVE A $6,000 TAX CREDIT A YEAR THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL REPRESENT ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH OR NOT. AND, IT IS AN INTERESTING THING, BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, I WILL TELL YOU THE ECONOMISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IS TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TAX CUT WE WILL SEE IN GENERATIONS. THIS WILL LIFT UP ONE INTO AMERICAN FAMILIES, TWO AND THREE AMERICAN PHAROAH , TWO IN THREE AMERICAN CHILDREN. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WILL PRESENT THE QUESTION , HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? [LAUGHTER] WELL, I WILL TELL YOU HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THAT TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND THE GREATEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE ARE A SOCIETY THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT EDUCATION. BUT NOT SO MUCH THE EDUCATION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. SO, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY, I HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH TEACHERS ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE WORKING TO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS TO PAY THE BILLS , TWO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS TO PAY THE BILLS. MONEY COMES OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, THAT BLESS HER SOUL , GOD BLESS HER SOUL, ATTENDED MY HIGH SCHOOL , LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. WE'LL HAVE MEMORIES OF THAT TEACHER WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. , WE ALL HAVE MEMORIES OF THAT TEACHER WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. WE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SPECIAL, BUT WE BELIEVED THEM, AND IT PUT US ON A PATH TO BE IN A PLACE SUCH AS THIS WHERE WE MIGHT BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S BE CLEAR, THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN , PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS AND ON SAND UNCLES , AND AUNTS AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE MAKE 10% LESS THAN SOME OF THE COLLEGE-EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS, WHICH IS WHY AS PRESIDENT, I WILL IMPLEMENT WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION, A FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT GAP ON AVERAGE IS EFFECTIVELY $13,500 A YEAR. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT $13,500 A YEAR. IN MOST PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT REPRESENTS A YEAR'S WORTH OF MORTGAGE STATEMENTS. , PAYMENTS. IT IS A YEAR'S WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. IT PUTS A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND TO MAKE A FINE POINT ON THIS, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] AND ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE THAT A SOCIETY CAN EXTEND TOWARD ITS CHILDREN IS TO INVEST IN THEIR EDUCATION, AND BY EXTENSION, THAT MEANS INVESTING IN THEIR TEACHERS. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT TO WHICH EVERYONE RECEIVES AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF JUST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT, WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT MEDICARE FOR ALL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE LET'S BE CLEAR, IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY, THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THEIR PAIN OR SAVE THEIR LIVES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR POCKET. THAT IS IMMORAL, AND IT IS SOMETHING WE CAN FIX, BUT WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND UNDERSTAND THIS WILL BE A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT OUR VALUES ARE AS A NATION. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] NOW, HONESTLY GUYS, ISN'T IT KIND OF SET I HAD TO SAY IT THAT WAY? [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW WHY I DID? BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON DC ON THIS SUBJECT WHO REPRESENTS AN EXCESS ESSENTIAL THREAT , AN EXCESS ESSENTIAL , AND EXISTENTIAL , AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. BUT THESE LEADERS ARE PUSHING SCIENCE-FICTION INSTEAD OF COLLECTIVE , INSTEAD OF FACTS. WE ARE IN A COLLECTIVE PERIL. [APPLAUSE] LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IN AMERICA THIS EVENING, IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY, FAMILIES WILL SIT DOWN FOR THEIR WEEKLY, NIGHTLY DINNER, THE PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THEIR CHILDREN ACROSS THE TABLE AND ASK THEM, HONEY, HOW WAS YOUR DAY? TO WHICH THOSE CHILDREN WILL RESPOND, WASN'T A GOOD DAY. WHY, WHAT HAPPENED? TODAY, WE HAD TO HAVE A DRILL. WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW WE HAD TO GO AND HIDE IN A CLOSET IN CASE THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF OUR SCHOOL. WHY, MOMMY AND DADDY, DID WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT DRILL? TO WHICH OF COURSE THE ANSWER IS, WELL, YOU SEE, THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH SUGGESTS YOU'RE ALWAYS , EITHER IN TABLE , EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE GUNS AWAY. WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, HONESTLY, I AM KIND OF FED UP WITH THIS ISSUE. I MEAN, LOOK, SOME PEOPLE WONDER WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG? WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN? WE ALL KNOW IT IS NOT LIKE WE ARE WAITING FOR A TRAGEDY , WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF TRAGEDIES. AND I DON'T EVEN NEED TO GO DOWN THE LIST WITH YOU GUYS. WE HAVE SEEN THE WORST OF TRAGEDIES. THE IDEAS HAD BEEN HAD. IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE FAILING TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT. HERE IS WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY, WHEN I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I AM GOING TO GIVE THE CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER, AND IF THEY DON'T, I'M GOING TO EXERCISE EXECUTIVE POWER AND DO THREE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU. ONE, I AM GOING TO REQUIRE THAT ANYONE WHO SELLS MORE THAN FIVE GUNS A YEAR IS REQUIRED TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS. I AM GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE ATF WILL REMOVE THE LICENSES FROM ANY GUN SELLER WHO VIOLATES THE LAW. AND, I AM GOING TO REVERSE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION DID AS IT RELATES TO FUGITIVES FOR JUSTICE. THEY TOOK THEM OFF THE LIST OF PIVOTED BUYERS , OF PROHIBITED BUYERS. I AM GOING TO PUT THEM BACK ON THAT LIST. THAT IS ALL I WILL DO IF CONGRESS FAILS TO ACT. [APPLAUSE] AND JUST TO PUT A FINE POINT ON IT, ON THE ISSUE OF GUN DEALERS? BECAUSE I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE. DID YOU KNOW THAT 90% OF THE GUNS THAT ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH CRIMES ARE SOLD BY 5% OF THE DEALERS? WE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. IN AMERICA TODAY, THERE ARE FAMILIES AND PARENTS THAT HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH MOSTLY THEIR SONS, SOMETIMES THEIR DAUGHTERS, WHEN THAT CHILD TURNS 12 YEARS OLD TO HAVE WHAT IS CALLED "THE TALK," WHEREIN THOSE PARENTS EXPLAIN, SON, YOU MAY BE STOCKED, YOU MAY BE ARRESTED , STALKED, YOU MAY BE ARRESTED, YOU MAY BE CHASTE, YOU MAY BE SHUT BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN. LET'S SPEAK TRUTH THAT IN AMERICA TODAY WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS DEEPLY FLAWED, THAT HAS BEEN INFECTED IN MANY WAYS BY BIAS, AND THAT CAN BE REFORMED. WE SHOULD AGREE THAT IN OUR AMERICA, NO YOUNG MEN SHOULD FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN. [APPLAUSE] AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE HAVE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WHO ON THAT SUBJECT, PREFERRED TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THAT WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED. THAT WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, A JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS. AND LET'S SPEAK TRUTH. WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO HAVE THAT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] I COULD GO ON AND ON WITH THE TRUTH. I AM GOING TO CLOSE UP ON THIS ONE, WHICH I BELIEVE ESPECIALLY NOW, WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY POWERFUL FORCES AND VOICES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. IT IS NOT ONLY CRITICAL THAT WE SPEAK, BUT THAT WE KNOW AND FEEL IN OUR HEARTS AND IN OUR SOLE. THAT TRUTH IS THIS , THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. LET'S SPEAK THAT TRUTH AND KNOW IT TO BE TRUTH. RIGHT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT. IT IS WHAT I CALL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THOUGHT, THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT, THE WITCHING HOUR, YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT, , THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF A SIMPLISTIC DEMOCRATIC A , DEMOGRAPHIC A POLLSTER PUT US IN. AND FOR THE MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, AND HAS TO DO WITH JUST ONE OF VERY FEW THINGS, OUR PERSONAL HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, OUR PARENTS, CAN I GET A JOB, KEEP A JOB, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY? CAN I PAY OFF THE STUDENT LOANS? FOR SO MANY FAMILIES IN AMERICA, RIGHT HERE INCLUDED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, CAN I HELP MY FAMILY MEMBER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND SO, I SAY, AS WE MARCH TO 2020, LET'S MARCH ONTO THAT KNOWING THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE. LET'S REJECT THE STUFF THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SAY IT IS US VERSUS THEM. I AM NOT BUYING THAT. I AM NOT BUYING IT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SAY YOU ARE , YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE CONVERSATION IN THE MIDWEST, ANOTHER ONE DOWN SOUTH, ANOTHER ONE ON THE COAST, I AM NOT BUYING THAT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND SO, I ALSO SAY THIS , ON OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IS BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE IN ASPIRATIONAL PEOPLE. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1770 6 , THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY? WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THOSE IDEALS. BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS THAT WE FIGHT TO GET THERE. AND SO, LET'S OWN THAT STRENGTH. LET'S OWN THAT STRENGTH IN A WAY THAT WE FIGHT KNOWING WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. LET THIS BE A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. LET THIS BE A FIGHT THAT WE KNOW IS BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY. AND KNOWING WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THAT IS HOW I THINK OF THE TASK BEFORE US. AND MY FINAL POINT THEN IS THIS , THIS MOMENT IN TIME WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, OTHERS WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT INFLECTION MOMENT? AND PART OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SAY IS, THERE WAS THIS ONE AFTERNOON HANGING OUT AT DARTMOUTH. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHAT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN TIME , WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WHAT ACTION WE TOOK. THAT WE STEP UP. , STEPPED. UP. . , THAT WE STEPPED UP. THAT WE ORGANIZED. WE GOT PEOPLE REGISTERED TO VOTE. WE TOOK THEM TO THE POLLS, AND WE WORKED KNOWING THE POWER OF WHO WE ARE WHILE WE ARE ALL IN THIS. WHEN WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF THIS NATION IS THE PEOPLE, AND WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE CAN BE. SO YEARS FROM NOW, WE WILL TELL THEM ALL THAT AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE WON. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS ONE OF , IT IS A BIG AREA OF CONCERN FOR ME. NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO FEAR THAT BURDEN OF STUDENT DEBT BRINGS RIGHT NOW. ON AVERAGE, NEW HAMPSHIRE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH $32,000 IN DEBT. BACK TO THE ISSUE I AM TALKING ABOUT WITH THE TEACHER PAY, I HAVE MET MORE TEACHERS WHO LEFT THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT AFFORD TO DO THE WORK AND PAY OFF STUDENT LOANS. ON THIS POINT, I WANT THAT STUDENT WHO MIGHT BE YOU OR ANYONE OF YOU, WHO IS EXCELLING IN SCIENCE AND HAS A PASSION TO GO TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS, I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO LOOK OUT ON YOUR FUTURE AND NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENT LOAN THAT YOU ARE FACING AND THE COST OF LIVING AND THEN DECIDE INSTEAD OF GOING TO TEACH MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS, I HAVE TO GO AND JOIN A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, OR WALL STREET BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO TEACH. THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES THAT COME WITH THE ISSUE OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT ONE IS ABOUT A BURDEN, A REAL BURDEN, EMOTIONALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, AND FINANCIALLY AS WELL AS WHAT WILL END UP BEING CAREER DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PAY THE BILL AS OPPOSED TO FOLLOWING YOUR PASSION AND DOING SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GROWING OUR SOCIETY. THESE ARE THE WAYS I THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. FIRST OF ALL, YES, TUITION FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, DEBT-FREE COLLEGE. NEXT, WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO LET STUDENTS REFINANCE THEIR STUDENT LOAN DEBT. FOR EXAMPLE, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE ANY OF YOU, BUT A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS BEFORE, IF THEY TOOK OUT THEIR LOANS BETWEEN 2006 IN 2013, THEY WERE LOOKING AT ABOUT 7% INTEREST RATE. I AM PROPOSING THAT WOULD BE RENEGOTIATED TO 3.5%. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN AND ACTUALLY BANNED THE SYSTEM SO THAT THE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE IS GOING TO BE INCOME-BASED. SO, IT WOULD BE PROPORTIONATE TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU ARE MAKING. THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WILL GO BACK TO MY DAYS AS BEING AN ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO WERE DEFRAUDING CONSUMERS, IS THE NUMBER OF PREDATORY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUT THERE WHO ARE SERVICING LOANS BUT REALLY IN A PREDATORY WAY THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STUDENTS. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THEM AND PROSECUTE THEM WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGED IN WRONG BEHAVIOR. [APPLAUSE] AND THEN, FINALLY, SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF THE ENTRY POINT IS SIMPLIFY THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCESS. ALL THE STUDENTS HERE KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS AWFUL. IT IS JUST AWFUL AND IT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN HAVE ACCESS AND KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO. THOSE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] NATALIA ASKED, HOW DO WE PLAN TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO GET SOMETHING DONE, RIGHT? I HEAR YOU. HERE'S THE THING. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS BIPARTISAN WORK THAT IS HAPPENING. I AM VERY PLEASED AND EXCITED TO HAVE TWO PIECES OF SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION THAT DO SOME VERY IMPORTANT WORK. ONE, I AM SPONSORING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REFORM THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ISSUE AND AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE SITTING IN JAIL FOR DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS EVEN POTENTIALLY YEARS WAITING TO GO TO TRIAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THEIR BACK POCKET TO PAY FOR BAIL TO GET OUT WHILE THEY ARE PENDING TRIAL. I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD BASICALLY CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM. MY COSPONSOR, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T AGREE ON MOST OF ANYTHING, HIS NAME IS RAND PAUL, A REPUBLICAN FROM KENTUCKY. HE IS MICHAEL COSPONSOR AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] , HE IS MY COSPONSOR AND WE ARE WORKING ON IT TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] HE SAID, KAMALA, APPALACHIA LOVES IT. GETTING BACK TO THE EARLIER POINT, THE BEST MAJORITY OF US HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. ANOTHER BILL DEALING WITH A VERY BIG ISSUE THAT DEALS WITH CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ELECTION AND THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS ELECTION SECURITY. SO, I SIT ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, AND WE RECEIVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE VULNERABILITIES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT WE ARE VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE WITH OUR ELECTIONS. I AM WORKING WITH A REPUBLICAN FROM OKLAHOMA, AND WE HAVE A BILL THAT WILL UPGRADE ALL OF THE STATES' ELECTIONS SYSTEMS, AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE MOST SECURITY , THE MOST SECURE WAY TO VOTE HIS PAPER. , IS PAPER. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE REPUBLICAN DEALER , REPUBLICAN LEADER WOULD BE ON THE FLOOR FOR A BOAT, WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED, BUT THERE IS BIPARTISAN WORK HAPPENING. I WILL SAY THIS ALSO. AFTER THE SELECTION, IT IS MY INTENTION , AFTER THIS ELECTION, IT IS MY INTENTION TO BRING CONGRESS TOGETHER AND TO SAY WE HAVE GOT TO FIX SOME THINGS. BECAUSE PART OF OUR COLLECTIVE FRUSTRATION WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS US STARING AT OUR BELLY BUTTON. THE WORLD IS PASSING US BY. WE HAVE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT ARE BEING NEGLECTED IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE BECOMING WEAKER BECAUSE OF IT. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS. AIN'T NOBODY ELSE GOING TO COME IN HERE AND FIX OUR PROBLEMS. IF WE DON'T DO IT, WHO WILL? WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT GLOBALIZATION, AT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO COMPETE ON A MUCH BIGGER PLANE, WE BETTER GET OUR ACT TOGETHER. AND MOST OF THE INTRACTABLE ISSUES THAT WE MUST ADDRESS ARE NOT EVEN BIPARTISAN. I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THEY ARE NONPARTISAN. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE REAL LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP, AND THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

CSPANKH3720196	Kamala Harris	2019-07-03	Senator Kamala Harris Town Hall in Des Moines, Iowa	THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. PLEASE, CAN WE GIVE IT UP FOR ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS OF IOWA AND AMERICA. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. YOU WEAR SO MANY HATS. AND YOU DESERVE A VOICE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. SIME HONORED TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. CONFLUENCE BREWERY, THANKS FOR TAKING US IN. THAT'S THE LAST MINUTE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE AND YOU JUST , YOU SHIFTED THE PLAN AND YOU CAME HERE. I CAN'T THANK CONFLUENCE BREWERY AND ALL OF YOU ON A RAINY AFTERNOON FOR BEING HERE. I'M VERY, VERY TOUCHED. THANK YOU. I'M KAMALA HARRIS, I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF MY THOUGHTS AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING QUESTIONS. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY BEFORE, I FULLY INTEND TO WIN THIS ELECTION. I REALLY DO. PART OF THE MEASURE OF OUR SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I AND WE LISTEN AS MUCH AS I TALK, ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN, SO I AM HERE TO LISTEN AS MUCH AS I AM TO TALK BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS. FIRST OF ALL, CAN WE GET A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR NARAL. YAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE WE ARE. SO I THANK YOU FOR COHOSTING THIS MEET AND GREET AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERS OF NARAL, MOST OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE WORK THEY DO AND YOU DO EVERY DAY. WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION, THAT QUESTION BEING, WHO ARE WE? WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES UPON WHICH WE BASE THAT PERSPECTIVE IS THAT RIGHT NOW, AND IT IS NOT A NEW MOMENT IN AMERICA, BUT IT IS A HIGHLIGHTED MOMENT. WOMEN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS UNDER ATTACK IN AMERICA. AND WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. WE HAVE GOT TO STAND FIRM. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN ALABAMA, YOU ALL KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN GEORGIA AND MISSOURI. WE ARE NOT BEING ALARMISTS WHEN WE SAY WOMEN WILL DIE. AND IN PARTICULAR, POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR. THOSE WHO CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE, WHICH IS IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED TO TELL WOMEN WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES. THEY CANNOT LEAVE WHERE THEY ARE IN A PLACE WHERE POLITICIANS HAVE DECIDED THEY KNOW BETTER ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS THAN HER OWN PHYSICIAN, AND WE ARE AT A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WOMEN ARE GOING TO NEED OUR SUPPORT AND OUR HELP AND THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RIGHT OF COURSE, TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVES, AND SO MANY OF THEM WILL NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE STATE IN WHICH THEY LIVE. NARAL, YOU'RE DOING THAT WORK OF SUPPORTING THESE WOMEN AND HELPING THEM IN THOSE PLACES AND BEING LEADERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN IS UNDER ATTACK. MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW, MY SISTER AND I , SHE IS HERE SOMEWHERE. THERE SHE IS. BUT YOU KNOW, I GREW UP, WE GREW UP HEARING ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES. OUR MOTHER WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE WAS A SCIENTIST. MY EARLIEST MEMORIES, SHE WOULD COME HOME ENRAGED OFTEN ABOUT THE LACK OF DIGNITY THAT WOMEN WERE GIVEN IN THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, IN THE CONTEXT OF TAKING WOMEN SERIOUSLY AND AT THEIR WORD WHEN THEY INDICATE OR EXPRESS WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. SO THIS ISSUE IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR TO ME. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT NOT ONLY REPRESENTS WHAT IS RIGHT IN TERMS OF GIVING A WOMAN HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND TO EXERCISING FREE WILL AND EXERCISING AGENCY, IT IS NOT ONLY AN ISSUE THAT IS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN AND THAT WOMEN MAY ACTUALLY DIE. IT IS ALSO AN ISSUE ABOUT UNDERSTANDING EQUALITY, FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF EQUALITY. MANY OF YOU WATCHED THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED THAT QUESTION, IS THERE ANY LAW THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT TELLS A MAN WHAT TO DO WITH HIS BODY AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE GOING TO ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING PLACES WITH THAT, RIGHT? NO, IT IS ABOUT EQUALITY. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF EQUALITY. SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ON THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY, PART OF WHAT I AM PREPARED TO DO IS NOT ONLY CONTINUE ENJOYING WITH ALL OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THIS FIGHT FOR FULL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR WOMEN, BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU AFTER ELECTED, I AM PREPARED TO REQUIRE THAT AS IT RELATES TO ANY STATE THAT HAS A HISTORY OF RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE, THAT THAT STATE HAS TO CLEAR THAT LAW, TO CLEAR IT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, TO CLEAR THAT IT COMPORTS WITH ROE V. WADE THROUGH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THAT IS CALLED PRECLEARANCE. AND UNTIL THAT LAW CLEARS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER, IT CANNOT GO INTO EFFECT. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE CLEARLY, WE NEED SOME OVERSIGHT, CONSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT, SO WE WILL PLAY ON THE DEFENSE, BUT LET'S ALSO TAKE IT ON THE OFFENSE. [APPLAUSE] THIS ISSUE IS ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES THAT FOR ME, IT RELATES TO THE ISSUES PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT FROM THE TIME OF MY BIRTH. OUR PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE STUDENTS IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WE JOKE THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, FOR JUSTICE, FOR EQUALITY, IS A FIGHT THAT MUST BE FOUGHT AND WON WITH EACH GENERATION. RIGHT? I THINK THERE WERE TWO POINTS THERE. ONE, THAT IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, THAT WHATEVER GAINS WE MAKE, THEY WILL NOT BE PERMANENT. IT IS THE NATURE OF IT. THE SECOND PART OF IT IS, , POINT THEN IS, KNOWING IT IS THE NATURE OF IT, DO NOT DESPAIR. DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED, LET'S NOT THROW UP OUR HANDS WHEN IT'S TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES, RIGHT? SO ON THIS FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE WE GET TO WORK AND DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE DEFENSE AND THE OFFENSE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES RIGHT NOW AT PLAY AS WELL. I WILL TELL YOU, THAT SAME MOTHER OF OURS, SHE WAS FIVE FEET TALL, BUT YOU COULD SAY SHE WAS SEVEN FEET TALL. SHE WAS FIERCE. SHE WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A HAND ON HER HIP AND WITH A VERY STRAIGHT FACE ASKED, "WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?" SO, I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS AT PLAY RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, CURRENTLY. OK? HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT HE HAS ACTUALLY BETRAYED AMERICA. HE RAN ON A PLATFORM THAT SAID I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF Y'ALL. I DON'T NEED TO TELL IOWA THAT THIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY , TRADE BY TWEET , HAS RESULTED IN IOWA FARMERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, THOSE WHO HAD CULTIVATED A MARKET OVER AT LEAST THE LAST DECADE IN CHINA TO SELL SOYBEANS, NOW SITTING ROTTING IN BINS. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW HE BETRAYED PEOPLE WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT AS MANY AS 700,000 AUTOWORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY LOSE THEIR JOB BY THE INDUSTRY YEAR. , BY THE END OF THE YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WITH THE SO-CALLED TRUMP TRADE POLICY, WHICH I CALL THE TRUMP TRADE TAX, AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE SPENDING 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS A MONTH MORE FOR EVERYTHING FROM SHAMPOOS TO WASHING MACHINES. IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. HE WANTS TO TAKE AMERICA BACKWARD, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. WE ARE PREPARED TO TURN THE PAGE. [APPLAUSE] AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I'M HERE TO TEACH YOU ABOUT PART OF MY BACKGROUND , I HAVE A BACKGROUND WHERE SUCCESSFULLY, I HAVE PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS WHO PREYED ON HOMEOWNERS, PROSECUTED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WHO PREYED ON SENIORS, PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PREYED ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND I WILL TELL YOU, WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND THE THING ABOUT THIS PERSON, IS HE'S GOT PREDATORY INSTINCTS AND A PREDATORY NATURE. BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET ABOUT PREDATORS. THEY PREY ON THE VULNERABLE. THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY ASSUME ARE WEAK. THEY PREY ON THOSE THEY ASSUME ARE DESPERATE. THE THING ABOUT PREDATORS IS THIS , THEY ARE COWARDS. WHAT WE NEED AND WANT IN OUR AMERICA IS A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO RECOGNIZES THAT HER STRENGTH DERIVES FROM AN ABILITY NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN, BUT LIFT PEOPLE UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LIFT THEM UP. LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET ON THIS CASE. LET'S LOOK AT THE RAP SHEET, SHALL WE? SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT PROMISED WORKING PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD BE HELPED, BUT THEN HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF YET AGAIN CONTINUOUS ATTEMPTS TO TAKE HEALTH CARE FROM AMERICAN FAMILIES, INCLUDING REVIVING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AS A BAN ON GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN IN CAGES AND THEY ARE SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF ORDER SECURITY, WHEN IN FACT THAT IS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE THIS CASE, BUT LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHAT IS BEFORE US IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE, IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND FIGHTING FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. TOMORROW, WE WILL CELEBRATE OUR NATION'S INDEPENDENCE. TOMORROW, WE WILL REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE A NATION WHO DERIVES ITS GREATEST STRENGTH FROM THE FACT THAT BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THOSE WORDS WE , THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY , WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR-EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE FIGHT TO GET THERE, AND SO, FIGHT WE WILL AND FIGHT WE MUST, AND LET US BE CLEAR , THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF SEEING AND KNOWING WHAT CAN BE, AND BELIEVING IN THAT, UNBURNED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN NOT ONLY OF KNOWING WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE YOUR , LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A FIGHT, THEREFORE, FOR OUR AMERICA AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW THEY WILL PAY THEIR BILLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE YOU ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN ARE PAID THE SAME AS MEN. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE WOMEN WILL ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE NO CHILD HAS TO ATTEND A HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN HIDE IN A CLOSET BECAUSE OF A GUNMAN ROAMING THE HALLS OF THEIR SCHOOLS. WE BELIEVE IN AN AMERICA WHERE EVERYONE IS GIVEN DIGNITY AND IS TREATED WITH EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS, AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT, AND AS WE MARCH TOWARD THE SELECTION IN , THIS ELECTION IN 2020, WITH AND BORN OUT OF AN ULTIMATE AND FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND THAT WE ALL RISE AND FALL TOGETHER AND THAT THE POWER IS IN THE PEOPLE, WITH ALL THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR SOULS, I PROMISE YOU, DES MOINES, WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION.

CSPANKH14720197	Kamala Harris	2019-07-14	Senator Kamala Harris in Gilford, New Hampshire	SENATOR HARRIS HAS ANOTHER EVENT PLANNED IN BOSTON LATER TODAY. BUT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SHE TOUCHED ON THE ICE RATES THAT STARTED THIS MORNING IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THOSE RAIDS, THE TOPIC OF SUNDAY TALK SHOWS. HERE'S NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO. HELLO EVERYONE. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN THE LAKES REGION. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU FOR OPENING YOUR HOME AND THIS OUTDOOR CONCERT AREA. THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU. AND THANK YOU ALL, ON A GORGEOUS AFTERNOON, THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, I REALLY DO. I KNOW WE ARE ALL HERE FOR ONE REASON FOR SURE. AND ALSO WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] I REALLY DO. I DO. AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE A MEASURE AND A METRIC OF OUR SUCCESS, BUT THE OTHER ONE THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS, THAT WE ARE RELEVANT. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THAT, ESPECIALLY AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE, THAN I TALK. WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS AND HAVE A CONVERSATION AFTER I SHARE A FEW OF MY THOUGHTS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. NEW HAMPSHIRE IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE AND IMPORTANT STATE. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE AND VALUE YOUR CONSIDERATION. LET'S GET STARTED. I THINK WE ALL KNOW, THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH AS INDIVIDUALS, AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING "WHO ARE WE? I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] AND SO, THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT WE MUST FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT WE WILL. FIGHTS FOR US, IN TERMS OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE, THAT IS NOT NEW. IT IS NOT NEW FOR US. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FAMILY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S. WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I, WE JOKED THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING, ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND OF COURSE, OF THE MANY HEROES OF THAT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THERE WERE THE LAWYERS, THURGOOD MARSHALL, CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SKILL OF THE PROFESSION OF LAW. TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM COURTROOMS. TO DO THE WORK WE KNOW MUST CONSTANTLY BE DONE OF REMINDING FOLKS OF THE GREAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL TO BE TREATED AS EQUALS. IN FACT, THAT'S WHY I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER AT A YOUNG AGE. I WAS AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY AND I ENDED UP GOING TO LAW SCHOOL AND THEN JOINING AN OFFICE THAT EARL WARREN HELPED BUILD, THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. HAD THAT COURT OF EARL WARREN NOT DECIDED BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. SO, FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY, FIGHTING FOR THE PROMISE OF OUR COUNTRY. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT CONTEXT OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I THINK ABOUT IT THROUGH THAT LENS. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE WAY I WAS RAISED. MY SISTER AND I HAVE A MOTHER WHO IS ALL OF FIVE FETAL, BUT SHE WAS FEROCIOUS. SHE WAS INTENSE. SHE WAS A POWER, ALL FIVE FEET OF HER, AND OUR MOTHER RAISED US WITH AN UNDERSTANDING AND A PROFOUND BELIEF THAT THE MEASURE FOR ANY OF US WILL BE BASED ON WHAT WE DO FOR OTHERS AND HOW WE SERVE, AND HOW WE LIFT OTHERS UP. OUR MOTHER WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO WOULD SAY TO ME MANY TIMES, KAMALA, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS, BUT MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE, YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED. [APPLAUSE] MY MOTHER WAS ALSO THE KIND OF PARENT WHO, IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU, PERHAPS WITH ONE HAND ON HER HIP, AND WITH A VERY STRAIGHT FACE WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND SAY WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO, I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME. YES, BUT WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TWO. WE HAVE TO PUT HALL OF THIS IN CONTEXT, THE REASON ALL YOU GUYS ARE HERE. BUT LET'S PUT IT IN CONTEXT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE. THE GUY RUNS ON A PLATFORM THAT IS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. OF COURSE, THAT LEGS THE QUESTION, GREAT FOR WHOM , BEGS THE QUESTION, GREAT FOR WHOM? AND I ALSO , YES, I LIKE INVOLVEMENT. INVOLVEMENT IS GOOD HERE. IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO ACT. GREAT AGAIN. YOU MEAN GOING BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, THE FAIR HOUSING ACT? WE ARE NOT DOING THAT. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. ON ALL OF THESE PROMISES OF HOW HE WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WORKING PEOPLE, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE DOES POLICY BY TWEET BASED ON FEAR. HIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY, TRADE POLICY BY TWEET, RESULTING IN THE FACT THAT FARMERS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY MAY BE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR, THAT 700,000 AUTO WORKERS MAY BE OUT OF A JOB BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THE AMERICAN FAMILY ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY, WHICH I CALL THE TRUMP TRADE TAX, AMERICANS TODAY ARE SPENDING $1.4 MILLION MORE A MONTH. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BETRAYED US. HE SAID HE WOULD DO ONE THING AND HAS DONE QUITE ANOTHER. HERE IS WHAT I SAY. THE FIGHT BEFORE US INCLUDES THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST HIM. AND I SAY THAT A PROSECUTOR SHOULD DO THE JOB. [APPLAUSE] SO I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVE IN MY CAREER, PERSONALLY PROSECUTED THE BIG BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES WHO PREYED ON HOMEOWNERS, CAUSING ONE OF THE GREATEST ECONOMIC UPHEAVALS WE HAVE SEEN IN GENERATIONS WITH THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. I HAVE TAKEN ON PHARMACEUTICAL COUNTRIES WHO PREYED ON SENIORS SELLING LIES AND MISINFORMATION. I HAVE PROSECUTED BIG OIL, THAT WAS IN THE BUSINESS OF POLLUTING THE WATER WE NEED TO DRINK. I HAVE TAKEN ON AN PROSECUTED TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT PREY ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I KNOW PREDATORS, AND WE HAVE A PREDATOR LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE HAS PREDATORY INSTINCTS AND A PREDATORY NATURE. HERE'S IS THE THING ABOUT PREDATORS. HERE'S THE SECRET. THEY PREY ON THE VULNERABLE. THEY PREY ON THE WEAK, ON THOSE THEY PERCEIVE TO BE WEAK. THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED OF HELP, THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN DESPERATE FOR HELP, AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT PREDATORS, THEY ARE COWARDS. THEY ARE COWARDS, SO LET'S TAKE THIS ON AND IN SO DOING, LET US ALSO DO IT WITH THE SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE AND WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY. LET'S TURN THE PAGE. LET'S WRITE THAT NEXT CHAPTER. AND LET'S WRITE THAT NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. AND AMERICA WHERE UNLIKE TODAY, WHERE ALMOST HALF OF FAMILIES ARE A 400 DOLLAR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE AWAY FROM COMPLETE UPHEAVAL, AND AMERICA WHERE TODAY, IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL TIME IN 99% OF COUNTIES, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT, IN AMERICA WHERE LAST YEAR 400 MILLION PEOPLE TOOK OUT LOANS FROM PAYDAY LENDERS WITH INTEREST OFTEN IN EXCESS OF 300 PERCENT, LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND IN SO DOING, WHEN WE GET ELECTED, CHANGE THAT TAX CODE SO THAT FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR WILL RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO $6,000 A YEAR THAT THEY CAN TAKE HOME AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN ENDING THE MONTH WITH DIGNITY OR NOT. AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. WELL, I WILL TELL YOU. ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THAT TAX BILL. THAT'S HOW WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. IN OUR AMERICA, NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHERE TEACHERS ARE PAID THEIR VALUE. [APPLAUSE] SO, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TEACHERS I MET WHO ARE WORKING TOO, SOMETIMES THREE JOBS. TEACHERS ARE TAKING MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE MAKE 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS, AUNTS AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. BUT WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM THEIR VALUE. THIS IS PERSONAL TO ME. MY FIRST GRADE TEACHER, MISSES FRANCIS WILLIAM, GOD REST HER SOUL, ATTENDED MY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION. MANY OF US HAVE A SIMILAR STORY OF SOME TEACHER ALONG THE WAY WHO CONVINCED US WE WERE SPECIAL. WE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY SPECIAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY TOLD US WE WERE AND WE BELIEVED THEM. THEY PUT US ON A PATH TO BEING HERE, TO MAYBE BEING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IN THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN, WE WILL MAKE THE FIRST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NATIONALLY, THAT GAP IS $13,500 A YEAR. IN MOST PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY, THAT'S A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. IT MEANS PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BARRIERS TO OUR STUDENTS COMING OUT AND JOINING A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PASSION. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. LET'S FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND AMERICA WERE NONE OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GO THROUGH A DRILL WHERE THEY ARE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD GO HIDE IN A CORNER OR IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A MESS SHOOTER ROAMING , MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IN AMERICA TODAY, WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO EVERY DAY ARE GOING THROUGH THIS. UNDER TERRIFIED. TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT THIS ALL MIGHT MEAN. AND WHEN THEY COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND SIT AT THE FAMILY DINNER TABLE, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ASKING THEIR PARENTS WHY, MOMMY AND DADDY, DID WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT DRILL, THE RESPONSES BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY EATERS IN WASHINGTON, , SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE THAT SUGGESTS YOU ARE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY. SUPPOSED LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY IT'S FINE IF YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING, BUT WE NEED TO HAVE REASONABLE GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IN THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN, AFTER THIS ELECTION, I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE AND PUT A BILL ON MY DESK FOR SIGNATURE. AND IF THEY DO NOT, I AM PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION BY PUTTING IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT WE HAVE HAD, REQUIRING THE ATF TO REVOKE THE LICENSES OF GUN DEALERS WHO ARE VIOLATING THE LAW, AND YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW, 90% OF THE GUNS ASSOCIATED WITH CRIME OR SOLD BY JUST 5% OF THE DEALERS. WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE BETTER ON THAT. FINALLY, BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, I AM PREPARED TO PUT IN PLACE A BAN ON THE IMPORTATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS IN OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] BUT TO PUT A FINE POINT ON THESE TWO AND SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS, I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS A TWO-TERM ATTORNEY GENERAL IN A STATE OF 40 MILLION PEOPLE. I WAS A DISTRICT ATTORNEY ELECTED TWICE. IN ALL OF MY CAREER, INCLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I HAVE ALWAYS CHALLENGED OUR TEAM TO TELL ME ON ANY ISSUE HOW IT AFFECTS THEIR CHILD. THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN SELL ABOUT THE RELEVANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF ANY POLICY IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW IT WILL IMPACT A CHILD. I COME FROM A PLACE THAT STRONGLY BELIEVES YOU SHOULD JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND THAT IT REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US AS A SPECIES. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A GREEN NEW DEAL AND WE WILL IMMEDIATELY REENTER THE PARIS AGREEMENT. [APPLAUSE] AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE SEE NOW, WHICH IS A FELLOW IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO IS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. AND I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, MY MOTHER WAS A SCIENTIST. SHE WAS A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE, TO RAISE HER TWO DAUGHTERS AND TWO DAUGHTERS AND TO END BREAST CANCER. SHE WOULD TAKE US TO THE LAB WITH HER AFTER SCHOOL AND ON WEEKENDS. MY FIRST JOB WAS CLEANING PIPETTES. I WAS AWFUL AND SHE FIRED ME. SO I BECAME A LAWYER. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE IDEA THAT ON THIS ISSUE, IT DOES REPRESENT AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO US, THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUCH A LEVEL OF NOT ONLY DENIAL BUT REALLY REJECTION OF WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF A LEADER, REALLY POINTS OUT ONE OF THE MOST URGENT NEEDS AND COME IN ON THE UNITED STATES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL BE PAID EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. [APPLAUSE] SO HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHEN THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS PASSED? YES. 1963, SAYS THE GENTLEMAN OVER HERE. 1963, OUR COUNTRY ACKNOWLEDGED BY STATUTE, BY ACT, THAT WOMEN WERE NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. FAST-FORWARD TO THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019, AND WOMEN ARE PAID $.80 ON AVERAGE TO THE DOLLAR. BLACK WOMEN, $.68. NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN $.58. LATINA WOMEN $.53. THERE IS NO LONGER A DEBATABLE POINT ON THIS. THIS SHOULD HAVE BECOME A BASIC RIGHT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, TO PAY PEOPLE EQUALLY? HERE'S WHAT I PROPOSE FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. INSTEAD OF MAKING IT INCUMBENT ON A WOMAN TO PROVE SHE IS NOT BEING PAID EQUALLY TO THE FELLOW IN THE CUBICLE NEXT TO HER, WE ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CORPORATION TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE PAYING PEOPLE EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. WE WILL REQUIRE THAT THEY PROVE THAT THEY ARE PAYING PEOPLE EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, MICROPHONES WILL WORK. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. OK. NO. AT THIS POINT, I'M GOING TO PROJECT. AND THEN I WILL LET YOU GUYS FIGURE THIS OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO, INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THAT WOMAN TO SHOW THAT SHE IS BEING PAID EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK, WE ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE BURDEN TO THE CORPORATIONS. TO PROVE THEY ARE ACTUALLY PAYING WOMEN EQUALLY FOR EQUAL WORK. AND THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO POST THAT INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITE. [APPLAUSE] THERE WE GO. I THINK IT'S WORKING. THERE IS A WHALE HERE SOMEWHERE. HELLO. I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING AND LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT. THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE DEBATE WAS LIKE THAT. I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING AND I HOPE YOU GUYS IN THE BACK CAN HEAR ME. I WILL PROJECT A LITTLE MORE. NOT ONLY WILL THEY HAVE TO POST IT ON THEIR WEBSITE, WE ARE ALSO GOING TO REQUIRE , BECAUSE THERE IS MORE, THAT FOR EVERY 1% DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT A WOMAN IS BEING PAID AND A MAN IS BEING PAID FOR EQUAL WORK, THE CORPORATION WILL BE FINED AN EQUAL PERCENT BASED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S PROFITS. [APPLAUSE] THAT WILL GET THEIR ATTENTION. LET'S TALK ABOUT AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. IN AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, CHILDREN WILL NOT BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER. [APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT TO BE CALLED BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. [APPLAUSE] AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S THE THING. UNLESS YOU ARE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOUR PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE THEN, WE WILL IMMEDIATELY RENEW DACA PROTECTIONS. AND WE WILL FIGHT TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. HI, KATIE. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN , OK. IS THERE ANOTHER MIKE FOR ME? TEAM? WHERE IS THE TEAM? IS ANYONE FROM THE TEAM AROUND? WE ARE WORKING ON IT READ COME CLOSER. THAT'S WORKING ON IT. COME CLOSER. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. OK, GREAT. MAYBE I WILL STAY ON THIS SIDE. OK, I AM JUST GOING TO STAND RIGHT HERE. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WE CAN NO LONGER TOLERATE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING IN OUR HISTORY AND RECENTLY, WHICH IS A FULL ON ATTACK AGAINST A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO HER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU, I HAVE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY, AND I HAVE MET A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE RIGHTLY TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT THESE LAWS THAT ARE BEING PASSED MEAN. I WAS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO IN ALABAMA, WHERE, AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THAT STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE AND INCARCERATE A PHYSICIAN WHO ASSIST IN AN ABORTION, UP TO 99 YEARS IN PRISON. GEORGIA, WE EXPECT. MISSOURI, WE EXPECT THE SAME KIND OF THING TO HAPPEN. WE ARE NOT BEING ALARMIST WHEN WOMEN WILL DIE. IN PARTICULAR, POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR, THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY, THE FINANCIAL ABILITY, OR ACCESS TO TRAVEL TO PLACES WHERE ABORTION AND AXIS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE LEGAL. WOMEN WILL DIE. AS PRESIDENT, I AM PREPARED TO REQUIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, REVIEW THE LAWS COMING FROM ANY STATE THAT HAS A HISTORY OF RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, TO DETERMINE IF THAT LAW IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND COMPORTS WITH ROE V. WADE. AND UNTIL IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL, IT CANNOT GO INTO EFFECT. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE THING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THIS ISSUE ON THE DEFENSIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING WORK ON THE GROUND, LEGAL AID, ALL THE NONPROFITS THAT ARE HELPING MOST WOMEN, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THIS ON THE OFFENSIVE. HE SEEN THIS WAS A NUMBER OF POLICIES AND PERSPECTIVES , WE HAVE SEEN THIS WITH A NUMBER OF MY POLICIES AND PERSPECTIVES. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO APPRECIATES THAT SHE IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND TAKE THAT JOB ON RESPONSIBLY. UNLIKE THE CURRENT APPLICANT TO THE WHITE HOUSE , [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY HAS BONE SPURS. BUT IS A SUPPOSE IT COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO ON THE SUBJECT , SUPPOSED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF RUSSIA'S PROVEN INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ON THE SUBJECT OF AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, A JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S TURN THE PAGE. LET'S TURN THE PAGE AND LET'S WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER. AND IT IS WELL WITHIN OUR POWER AND OUR ABILITY TO DO THIS. I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF MANY THINGS, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WHO WE ARE, WE ARE STRONG AS A PEOPLE. WE ARE STRONG AS A PEOPLE, AND ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, THE WORDS WE WROTE THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. BY OUR NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR-EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS. BUT PART OF THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. SO, FIGHT WE WILL, AND FIGHT WE MUST, KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS, THEREFORE, IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. I GUESS WE ARE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE QUESTIONS , OH, DO YOU WANT TO DO THE QUESTIONS? OK. IN THE DEBATES LAST WEEK OR WHATEVER IT WAS, YOU HAD A POSITION ON BUSING. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHERE YOU STAND AFTER , NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE DEBATE. YEAH. I MEAN, I , THE QUESTION WAS HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT BUSING? IT CAME UP DURING THE DEBATE AND WHERE DO I STAND, AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT NOW NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE DEBATE? I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT CAME UP, THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FORMER MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHO WERE PROVING TO BE SEGREGATIONIST, WHO HAD A HISTORY AND PRETTY MUCH LET THEIR CAREERS AND REPUTATIONS OFF OF THAT HISTORY, FIGHTING AGAINST THE INTEGRATION IN OUR COUNTRY. OF FIGHTING AGAINST INTEGRATION OF THE RACES IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY WERE FIGHTING AGAINST INTEGRATION IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BACK TO BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE REASON THAT CASE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT, BECAUSE THIS WAS SUCH A CONTESTED ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY. THERE WERE LAWS AND LEADERS IN PLACE WHO FOUGHT FOR THE SEGREGATION OF THE RACES AS IT RELATES TO COLLEGE EDUCATION. THIS IS PART OF THE SAD HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF, AND THERE IS A LOT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE PROUD OF, AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. I WILL SAY THIS WITH A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIDE. A FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA WENT ON TO BECOME THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT THE SUBJECT WAS, IT WAS REALLY INTEGRAL TO A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS. PART OF THE HISTORY OF THAT, EARL WARREN SAID THIS IS A CASE THAT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR A UNANIMOUS DECISION. IF YOU READ THE HISTORY BEHIND THE CASE, HE PUSHED THERE WOULD BE EIGHT UNANIMOUS DECISION THAT THERE WAS, TO INTEGRATE THE SCHOOLS AND THE CALIFORNIA. FAST-FORWARD ALMOST 20 YEARS. I WAS AN EDUCATOR IN URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 20 YEARS. THIS IS BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS BEING A PROGRESSIVE PLACE, RIGHT? IN BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, I WAS ONLY PART OF THE SECOND CLASS TO INTEGRATE BERKELEY SCHOOLS. THIS IS THE REALITY OF HOW ALL THAT PLAYED OUT IN OUR NATION, WHICH IS IT DIDN'T JUST , 1954, IT GOT DECIDED, AND THE KEY WAS UNLOCKED. THERE HAD TO BE POLICIES AND PRESSURES IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY FULFILL THE PROMISE OF BROWN V BOARD OF EDUCATION TO INTEGRATE THE SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE WERE RESISTING IT, VIOLENTLY RESISTING IT, AND WE CAN REMEMBER THE IMAGES THEMSELVES. VIOLENTLY RESISTING THE DESEGREGATION OF OUR SCHOOLS. SO WHAT ELSE HAS TO HAPPEN? THEY HAD TO BE PUT IN PLACE, MANDATORY BUSING. BERKELEY WAS NOT ONE OF THE PLACES THAT DID IT VOLUNTARILY, BUT IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY, MANDATORY BUSING HAD TO BE PUT IN PLACE, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH RESISTANCE, EVEN VIOLENT RESISTANCE TO THE INTEGRATION OF OUR SCHOOLS. ON THE SUBJECT OF MANDATORY BUSING IN OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THAT ERA AND THAT PLACE IN TIME, YES. I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS NECESSARY. ONE OF MY OPPONENTS IN THIS RACE, STILL TO THIS DAY, DISAGREES WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HIM, BUT I DO KNOW HE AND I HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THAT ISSUE, AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY, BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE QUESTION THAT IS BEING ASKED, THERE IS NO QUESTION, AND I THINK THE EDUCATORS AMONG US KNOW THAT EVEN TODAY, WE ARE SEEING EXTREME SEGREGATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. THERE IS A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR IT, INCLUDING, IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CANDID CONVERSATION, THAT AFTER BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE INTEGRATION, FORCED INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS, THERE WERE SOME FAMILY THAT SAID, I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE EDUCATED WITH BLACK KIDS, AND FAMILIES STARTED PULLING THEIR KIDS OUT OF THE SCHOOLS. YOU CAN TRACK THEIR RESOURCES BEING PULLED OUT OF THOSE SCHOOLS. IF YOU GO INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF MANY STATES AND OUR COUNTRY, YOU WILL SEE EXTREME SEGREGATION BY RACE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS NOT A FUNCTION OF PEOPLE IN STATEHOUSES AND LEGISLATURES WHO ARE RESISTING INTEGRATION, IT, THE REASON IS DIFFERENT. FOR THAT REASON, I THINK MANDATORY BUSING IS NOT A SOLUTION TO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN NUMBER OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO DO IT. ONE IS WE NEED TO TRACK IT AND KEEP THE STATISTICS ABOUT RACE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND GERRYMANDERING ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING WHO CAN LIVE IN WHAT DISTRICT AND WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL BOARDS TO GET AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT TO DO TO ENCOURAGE SUPPORTING PUBLIC MAGNET SCHOOLS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS. BUSING MAY BE ONE OF THEM, BUT NOT THE KIND OF MANDATORY BUSING WE SAW THEN. IT IS SAD THAT KIDS JUST LIKE ME WHO WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE WAR ZONES THEY ARE LIVING IN, WANT TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT THEY GET SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHER AND FATHER TO BE PUT IN A CAGE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LOVE OUR YOUNG LEADERS. I JUST DO. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, ELLIE, I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. THANK YOU. IT TAKES A LOT WITH THIS BIG CROWD TO STAND UP AND SPEAK LIKE THAT IN PUBLIC WITH NO MIC. THANK YOU, ELLIE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT IS ABOUT SO MANY THINGS. IT IS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD LIVE OUR VALUES TO THE WORLD. WE AS A COUNTRY, WE SAY THAT WE PRIORITIZE HUMANITARIAN APPROACHES TO ISSUES, BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF THAT IN THE POLICIES OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. AFTER THE DEBATE, WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE DEBATES, IT WAS IN MIAMI ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO, AND THE MORNING AFTER, I, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, DROVE DOWN TO A PLACE IN FLORIDA CALLED HOMESTEAD. AND IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA, THERE IS A FOR-PROFIT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY THAT IS CURRENTLY HOUSING 2700 CHILDREN. FOR PROFIT, RIGHT? LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BUSINESS MODEL IS THERE. THE BUSINESS MODEL THERE IS THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE PROFITING OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED CHILDREN. WE GET THERE, AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, BUDGET COMMITTEE, AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THIS IS A FACILITY THAT IS A PRIVATELY RUN FACILITY, BUT PAID WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS. THEY WOULD NOT LET US IN. I MEAN, WE COULD NOT FORCE THEM PHYSICALLY, RIGHT? IT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IT IS HARD, AND IT IS WRONG, AND IT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. OF COURSE WE NEED TO TAKE THEIR MONEY. WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN ALL OF THOSE AT DETENTION FACILITIES. , THOSE PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I SAW. I WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND CLIMBED UP A LADDER TO LOOK OVER THE FENCE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE, BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT GIVE US ACCESS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I SAW. I SAW CHILDREN , CHILDREN , LINING DOWN SINGLE FILE, BY GENDER, WALKED INTO BARRACKS. BY THE WAY, I ALSO MET SOME OF THEIR PARENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. IT'S INHUMANE, TO ELLIE'S POINT. IT'S INHUMANE AND IT'S WRONG FOR THAT REASON. AND WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND ALSO, TO YOUR VERY POINT, ELLIE , LISTEN, IT AS A BASIC MATTER, MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT. LET'S GO BASIC FOR A MOMENT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. THE PLACE WHERE YOU GREW UP, WHERE YOUR COUSINS AND FAMILY LIVE, THE PLACE WHERE YOU MIGHT WORSHIP AND YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE HOME. SO YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND ASK, WHY ARE THEY HERE? IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN, WHAT IS THAT STORY? PART OF THAT STORY IS THIS. THERE'S A MOTHER AND A FATHER WHO DECIDED TO PAY A COYOTE, TO PAY A STRANGER TO TRANSPORT THEIR CHILD FROM THEIR HOME, THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, TRANSPORT THEM THROUGH THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF MEXICO, FACING UNKNOWN PERIL. WHY WOULD THAT PARENTS DO THAT? BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY LET THEIR CHILD STAY WHERE THEY ARE, THEY WOULD FACE GREATER DANGER. WHAT DOES THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS PERSON, THIS PRESIDENT DO? TO MOST OF THEM, HE SAYS "GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM." IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF HUMAN VALUES, IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF AMERICAN VALUES. IT IS WRONG AND IT MUST STOP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO ELLIE, THANK YOU. AND YOU ARE THINKING, IT YOU ARE SPEAKING UP TODAY. YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOUR WORDS, WHEN YOU STOOD UP ON THAT CHAIR AND SPOKE LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF ALL OF THESE FOLKS, YOU JUST SPOKE FOR ALL OF THOSE KIDS. YOU JUST SPOKE FOR ALL OF THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GET IT. WE ARE IN A RURAL STATE. WE HAVE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH OUR CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO HAVE BROADBAND. IT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT DOES NOT GET ANSWERED ENOUGH FOR US. ONE WE TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF , HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE, ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS, WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WE NEED, , IS AN OPTION, BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE BROADBAND. I THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF , IT IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE. IT IS CREATING A SUPPORT SYSTEM. I LIKE THAT IDEA. IS THERE A KID GOVERNOR ELECTION? THERE IS, RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE? WHEN IS IT? ARE YOU CAMPAIGNING? THE MIDTERMS? ALL RIGHT. OK? ALL RIGHT. DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP. I WILL SEE YOU LATER, OK?	https://www.c-span.org/video/?462455-1/senator-kamala-harris-gilford-hampshire	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke to supporters at a house party in Gilford, New Hampshire	462455-1	Speech
CSPANKH10820199	Kamala Harris	2019-08-10	Senator Kamala Harris at Iowa State Fair	HI EVERYONE. WOW, I AM AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR. ON THE SOAPBOX. I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE. AND THRILLED. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHO WE ARE. SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ALL HEARD GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. SO LET'S JUST GET STARTED. I ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES. I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS. BUT I'VE GOT SWEATY MINUTES. HEROD IS SPIRIT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING WHO ARE WE? AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. SO THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. AND FIGHT WE WILL. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR US. WE AS AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE. AND FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEALS. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I AM A DAUGHTER OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE 1960'S. MY SISTER AND I, MAYA, WE JOKE WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF ADULTS WHO SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING. ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. AND IN FACT MANY OF THE HEROES OF THAT MOVEMENT WERE THE LAWYERS WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREET TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY AND REMIND FOLKS OF THAT PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776 THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. WHICH IS WHAT INSPIRED ME TO WANT TO BECOME A LAWYER. SO WE ARE FIGHTERS AND WE ARE BORN OF FIGHTERS. I WAS RAISED ALSO BY A MOTHER. MY SISTER MAIA AND I - OUR MOTHER -SHE WAS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL. IF YOU EVER MET OUR MOTHER, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. AND SHE WAS FIERCE. SHE WAS THE KIND OF PARENT WHO WOULD SAY TO ME ALL THE TIME, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. YOUR LIFE SHOULD BE BASED ON SERVICE TO OTHERS, NOT SELF INTEREST. AND MY MOTHER WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME IN OUR HOUSE, IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING. OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A STRAIGHT FACE ONE HAND PROBABLY ON A HIP AND SHE WOULD SAY, WELL WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE YOU GO. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. IT IS CONTEXT. HERE IS A GUY WHO CAME INTO OFFICE ON A SLOGAN THAT WAS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHICH, OF COURSE, FOR MANY OF US WAS, AGAIN FOR WHOM? BUT IT IS BACKWARD THINKING. BACK TO WHAT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE FAIR HOUSING ACT? BEFORE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] AND HE CAME IN OFFICE MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES TO FOLKS. AND IN PARTICULAR WORKING PEOPLE. EVERYONE FROM FARMERS HERE IN IOWA TO AUTOWORKERS. CAME IN MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO HELP OUT WORKING PEOPLE. AND THEN WHAT DID HE DO? HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. THEN WHAT HAPPENS, ENGAGES IN THE SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY THAT WAS TRADE BY TWEET BORN OUT OF HIS FRAGILE EGO IN A WAY THAT WAS ABOUT UNILATERAL ACTION THAT HAS RESULTED IN FARMERS HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, SOYBEANS ROTTING IN BINS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AUTOWORKERS MAY BE OUT OF WORK BY THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HIS SO-CALLED TRADE POLICY. I CALL IT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX. AND HERE'S THE THING. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO THIS OBVIOUSLY IS AN ELECTION. ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TURN THE PAGE. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. ALSO KNOWING THAT WE REJECT THE VOICE THAT HE HAS PROVIDED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT SOWING HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. WE REJECT THAT. IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF WHO WE ARE. [APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW WHO WE ARE. WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS WHAT I CALL THE 3:00 A.M. THOUGHT. YOU KNOW THE THING THAT WAKES YOU UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. BECAUSE HERE'S THE DEAL. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US. WHEN WE WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THINKING THAT THOUGHT. IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOUR - FOR - THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC SOME POLLSTER PUT US IN. AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS. OUR PERSONAL HEALTH. THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OR PARENTS. FOR SO MANY OF, CAN I GET A JOB, KEEP A JOB, PAY THE BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH, RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. FOR OUR STUDENTS CAN I PAYOFF THOSE STUDENT LOANS? FOR SO MANY FAMILIES, CAN I HELP OUR FAMILY MEMBER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND THAT IS PART OF THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL FIGHT FOR THAT. AND OUR FIGHT IS BORN OUT OF THAT KNOWLEDGE. AND SO YES, WE MUST TURN THE PAGE AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN THAT. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE DUDE HAS GOT TO GO. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] SO THE POINT THEN IS LET US ALSO , THINK ABOUT WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER. AND DOING THAT TOGETHER. AND WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE . THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE SAY, YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO HAVE ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD AND FOOD ON THE TABLE. AN AMERICA WE BELIEVE AND WHAT WE SAY IT IS NOT OK AS OF TODAY IN AMERICA ALMOST HALF OF OUR FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. IT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHEN IN 99% OF THE COUNTIES IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU'RE A MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A MARKET RATE FOR ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT. IT IS NOT OK THAT LAST YEAR IN OUR COUNTRY, 12 MILLION PEOPLE HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN OF ON AVERAGE $400 FROM THE PAYDAY LENDER AT AN INTEREST RATE OF OFTEN IN EXCESS OF 300%. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN IT I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN WE WIN THIS ELECTION, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE AS FOLLOWS. FOR FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN $100,000 PER YEAR, THEY WILL GET UP TO A $6,000 TAX CREDIT THAT YOU CAN TAKE HOME AT UP TO $500 A MONTH WHICH WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE FAMILIES GETTING THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH OR NOT. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KEEPS PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT IS THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PAY TEACHERS THEIR VALUE. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE TEACHERS ON AVERAGE ARE PAID 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. I HAVE MET MORE TEACHERS HERE AND I WENT AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. OUR TEACHERS ARE COMING 94% OF THEM OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. HERE'S THE THING, THEY'RE ONLY TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS AND AUNTIES AND UNCLES. AND OUR TEACHERS. WE MUST PAY THEM THEIR VALUE. SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PUT INTO PLACE THE FIRST IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IN IOWA, THAT IS $12,200 PER YEAR. $12,200 PER YEAR. IN MANY PLACES THAT IS A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. $12,200 PER YEAR. THAT IS A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERY BILLS. $12,200 PER YEAR. THAT IS PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DEBT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. - SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST BARRIERS TO OUR KIDS COMING OUT OF SCHOOL AND ENJOYING A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PASSION. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. OUR BABIES, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY ARE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO HIDE IN A CLOSET OR CROUCH IN A CORNER IN THE EVENT THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL. THOSE CHILDREN OF OURS WHO COME HOME AT NIGHT AND ASK, WHY DID WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT DRILL? TO WHICH OF COURSE, OUR RESPONSE IS, BECAUSE THERE ARE SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO , HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REJECT A FALSE CHOICE WHICH SUGGESTS YOU ARE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY, WHO HAVE FAILED TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO AGREE, FIND IF YOU WANTED TO GO HUNTING BUT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A RENEWAL OF THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [CROWD CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] SO IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, IF MITCH MCCONNELL DOESN'T CALL US BACK TO VOTE ON A BILL, THEN WHEN WE ARE ELECTED, I WILL GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS TO PULL THEIR ACT TOGETHER ON THIS AND PUT A BILL ON MY DESK FOR SIGNATURE. AND IF THEY DO NOT, I AM PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO PUT IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT, TO REQUIRE THE ATF TO TAKE LICENSES FROM GUN DEALERS WHO VIOLATE THE LAW, AND BY EXECUTIVE ACTION TO BAN THE IMPORTATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS INTO OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT OF EVERYONE, AND NOT A PRIVILEGE OF JUST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL PUT IN PLACE, KNOWING THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEEPS PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT, A WE WILL PUT IN PLACE A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN WHICH I HAVE PROPOSED, WHICH WILL OFFER EVERYONE HEALTH CARE WITHOUT REGARD TO COST, PUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN CHECK. SO THERE WILL BE NO DEDUCTIBLES, NO CO-PAYS, YOU WILL STILL HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PLAN, AND EXPAND SERVICES AND BENEFITS. BECAUSE IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE KNOW THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE, A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. IT IS A MORAL ISSUE AND WE MUST , DO BETTER. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEEPS US UP AT NIGHT IS THE SECURITY OF OUR HOMELAND, AND WE NEED TO HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF THAT UNDERSTANDS HER GREATEST PRIORITY IS CONCERNING HERSELF WITH THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR NATION, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WHO ON THE ISSUE OF THE FACT OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF AMERICAN AN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] I WILL SAY THIS, LISTEN. I KNOW A LOT OF US OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN WONDERING HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT, WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE BEEN THROWING OBJECTS AT THAT INANIMATE OBJECT CALLED THE TELEVISION, GOING TO THERAPY TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, BUT IN HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO REMIND ALL OF THE FRIENDS. IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION AND AS A PEOPLE IS THAT, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS, THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED, WE HAVE NOT REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS, WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. SO FIGHT WE WILL, AND FIGHT WE MUST, KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM, THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING WHAT CAN BE AND BELIEVING IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND THIS, THEREFORE, IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THANK YOU, IOWA, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, IOWA. SO PART OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS THIS. TO GET THROUGH AND TURN THE NEXT PAGE, TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. I THINK IT WILL TAKE A PROSECUTOR TO DO THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE GOT A RAP SHEET, AND IT IS LONG. LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE. A TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, TO THE POINT THAT 60 OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE U.S. PAID NO TAXES LAST YEAR. WHO HERE PAID NO TAXES LAST YEAR? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TRADE POLICY THAT IS RESULTING IN DIRECT HARM TO WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. LET'S TALK ABOUT A POLICY THAT IS ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES AND SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY, WHEN WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT? [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT A FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE, AND OUR FARMERS AND EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS IT, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, IT IS A CRISIS, IT IS CAUSED BY HUMAN BEHAVIORS WHICH CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE TO OUR LIFESTYLE, AND REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS, AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO IS PUSHING SCIENCE FICTION INSTEAD OF SCIENCE FACT. TO OUR COLLECTIVE PERIL. HE TALKS ABOUT WIND TURBINES. HERE IN IOWA, YOU ARE A LEADER IN THIS. 40% OF IOWA'S ELECTRICITY COMES FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY. YOU ARE A MODEL. BUT WE HAVE A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO SAYS WIND TURBINES CAUSE CANCER. I LOVE GOVERNOR INSLEE'S LINE. I GIVE HIM A HAT TIP. HE SAID, TURBINES DON'T CAUSE CANCER, THEY CAUSE JOBS. [LAUGHTER] SO WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST HIM. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU KNOW THE PUNDITS WILL TALK ABOUT AND COMPARE, AND I THINK OVERLY COMPARE 2016 TO 2020. 2020 WILL NOT BE 2016. 2020 WILL NOT BE 2016. THERE IS NOW, I CALL IT A RAP SHEET. THERE IS NOW A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT HAS SPOKEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHO KNOW THOSE WHO BELIEVED IN HIM WERE BETRAYED, WHO KNOW THAT WE EXPECT THAT THE PERSON WHO OCCUPIES THAT MOST PRECIOUS SEAT, WHICH IS OUR GOVERNMENT, NOT HIS, THAT IS, WE ARE A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE, WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAS THIS MICROPHONE IN HER HAND, IT IS A VERY, VERY POWERFUL FORCE, AND MUST ALWAYS BE USED NOT TO BEAT PEOPLE DOWN BUT TO LIFT PEOPLE UP. THAT IS WHO WE ARE. MY TIME IS UP. THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU. [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF IT. CONGRESS IS INVESTED IN THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY. AMONG THEM IS THE AUTHORITY TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT PASSES THROUGH COMMERCE. FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE DONE THE LEGAL RESEARCH ON IT. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT. BUT IT IS STRONG. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. OUR POLICY AND MY PREPAREDNESS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IS JUST FRANKLY BECAUSE I AM FED UP. CONGRESS HAS DONE NOTHING. I MEAN EVEN AT THIS MOST LATEST TRAGEDY. WE MAY BRING PEOPLE BACK WE MAY DO SOMETHING. ALL THESE BABY STEPS. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THIS. AND WE KEEP HAVING TRAGEDY AFTER TRAGEDY. SOMEBODY ASKED ME, MAYBE THIS TRAGEDY WILL SPUR SOME ACTION. WELL, THIS TRAGEDY IS AS TRAGIC AS EACH ONE WE HAVE SEEN. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTION OVER MANY, MANY YEARS. SO YES, I'M PREPARED TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. I BELIEVE AND I'M CONFIDENT IT WILL PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER. LET ME TELL YOU THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH THAT QUESTION. AND IT IS BEING ASKED A LOT. IT BEGINS AND ENDS WITH A QUESTION AND THE ANSWER TO THAT, AS OPPOSED TO RECOGNIZING THE LONG HISTORY IN UNITED STATES OF THIS AS AN ISSUE, THE ISSUE OF HATE. I AS A PROSECUTOR HANDLED HATE CRIMES. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL RUNNING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, I WAS PUBLISHING CRIME REPORTS EVERY YEAR. THIS IS NOT NEW IN AMERICA. HATE IS NOT NEW. HATE THAT TAKES THE FORM OF RACISM, ANTI-SEMITISM, HOMOPHOBIA, ISLAMOPHOBIA IS NOT NEW IN OUR COUNTRY. AND I WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN A CONVERSATION THAT SIMPLIFIES THIS ISSUE WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THE HISTORY, SPEAKING TRUTH ABOUT IT, AND RECOGNIZING IT HAPPENED BEFORE THIS GUY WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. HE IS CERTAINLY FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. IF ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION, LET'S HAVE IT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. WHEN WE HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN POWAY TO THE SYNAGOGUE TO CHARLOTTESVILLE, TO WHAT HAPPENED IN EL PASO, WE SHOULD ALL BE HAVING A CONVERSATION AND PARTLY LOOKING IN THE MIRROR TO SAY WHERE HAVE WE BEEN ON THIS, AND WHAT ARE WE PREPARED TO DO. PART OF IT HAS TO BE, UNLIKE WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND PRESIDENT HAVE DONE, I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS, THEY SHUT DOWN THE RESOURCES ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM. THEY JUST SHUT IT DOWN, IN TERMS OF PUTTING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT INTO IT AND ACKNOWLEDGING IT IS REAL AND IT MUST BE TREATED AS WHAT IT IS, DOMESTIC TERRORISM. SO IMMEDIATELY, I WOULD REFORM THAT PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE PRIORITY. ALSO IT IS ABOUT THE MICROPHONE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS. A PERCEPTION ABOUT AN ISSUE LIKE RACE. OR RELIGION. OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND THEN JUST GO DOWN THE LIST. AND THIS PRESIDENT HAS USED THE VERY PRECIOUS TOOL OF THAT MICROPHONE IN MY OPINION ABOUT THE STYLING, THE POWER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE BEING IN IOWA. EACH TIME I COME, I REALLY DO , I GAIN A LOT FROM IT. I GAIN PERSPECTIVE FROM IT. WE HAVE OVER 65 STAFF IN IOWA. WE HAVE BEEN STAFFING UP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. I'M INTRODUCING MYSELF TO PEOPLE. IT WILL BE A PROCESS AND WITH EACH STEP THAT WE TAKE, WE ARE GAINING GROUND AND BUILDING MOMENTUM. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HAD , WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. I HAVE NO INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT IT. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IN PRISONS, THERE IS A LOT OF REFORM THAT IS NEEDED AND THAT RELATES EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE WORKED ON FOR YEARS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO END SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT MINORS AND WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO ON INCARCERATED WOMEN THAT I HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION ON INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE SHACKLED EVEN DURING PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. THERE IS LOTS TO DO ACROSS THE BOARD. ON THAT SUBJECT, WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS SUPPORTED , AND , SUPPORTED PRIVATE PRISONS. WE NEVER WANT TO BE IN THE BUSINESS OF HAVING UNITED STATES TAXPAYER DOLLARS GO TO AN INDUSTRY BY ITS VERY BUSINESS MODEL IS ABOUT PROFITING OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS INCLUDING WHAT I SAW IN FLORIDA. A PRIVATE DETENTION FA TILT THAT HOUSES 2700 CHILDREN WHICH MEANS THAT YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE GOING TO FUND THE PROFIT OF THE INCARCERATION OF CHILDREN. A NUMBER OF THINGS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS. WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS CONDUCTED TRADE POLICY BY TWEETS. RIGHT? HE CAME TO IOWA MAKING ALL SORTS OF PROMISES TO FARMERS. HE JUST CUT OFF A MARKET TO OUR FARMERS THAT THEY HAD BEEN CULTIVATING FOR WELL OVER A DECADE. NOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY. LET'S STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT TRADE BY DEFINITION MEANS THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PARTY. BECAUSE YOU'RE TRADING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. USUALLY THERE ARE A FEW PARTIES INVOLVED. WE HAVE TO CONDUCT TRADE POLICY IN A WAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE MANY RHODE ISLANDS AND FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN PLAY IN THAT. UNILATERAL. THAT IS TRADE POLICY IN A WAY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NEGOTIATION AND THE LEVERAGE THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. TRUE, TRADE POLICY FOR ME IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE ABOUT PROTECTING THE AMERICAN WORKERS AND HAVING THOSE AS OUR PRIORITIES. FOR THAT REASON, I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF WHAT I CALL 2.0. I AM GOING TO SPEND MY TIME IN IOWA AND WORK ON EARNING THE SUPPORT OF EVERY IOWAAN AND MY AGENDA, WHICH I CALL THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA IS BORN OUT OF MY FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON AND THAT PEOPLE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO IS A PROBLEM-SOLVING PRESIDENT AND THE PROBLEMS ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT KEEP THEM UP AT NIGHT AND WAKE THEM UP IN THELED IN OF THE NIGHT. IT IS ABOUT HEALTHCARE, KEEPING A JOB. GETTING THROUGH THE THE END OF THE MONTH BEING ABLE TO PAY THE BILLS. IT IS ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND EDUCATION. ISSUES LIKE TRADE. THESE ARE MY PRIORITIES AND I KNOW THEY SPEAK TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF US REGARDLESS TO THE PARTY THAT IS REGISTERED TO VOTE. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE EPSTEIN CASE TO COMMENT ON THAT. I JUST HEARD ON THAT. ON THE ISSUE OF WAL-MART, YEAH, THEY SHOULD STOP SELLING GUNS. I DO BELIEVE THAT. IT IS JUST , WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS. LET'S START WITH THAT. WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE AS I SAID RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAY THEY ARE SELLING THEM. IT IS NOT THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP SELLING THEM BUT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE CHECKS AND POLICIES ON ENTHUSIASM WE NEED BACKGROUND CHECKS. IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN BACKGROUND CHECKS, THEN FINE. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT. THAT'S WHY SAID THAT.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?463123-2/senator-kamala-harris-iowa-state-fair	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, spoke at the Iowa State Fair.

CSPANKH69201910	Kamala Harris	2019-09-06	Senator Kamala Harris at Portsmouth, New Hampshire Democratic Dinner	ON FRIDAY, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS WAS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS ANNUAL BANQUET. THIS IS 45 MINUTES. [APPLAUSE] IT IS AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE THE GUEST SPEAKER. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I HAD DECIDED TO SUPPORT KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT. I WAS FIRST ATTRACTED TO SENATOR HARRIS BECAUSE AFTER FOUR YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP I FELT THERE WAS NOTHING OUR COUNTRY NEEDED MORE THAN RECONCILIATION AND HEALING. SHE STRUCK ME MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES AS A UNIFIER THAT COULD BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER RATHER THAN SPLIT IT FURTHER APART. I SAW HER HERE AT THE SOUTH CHURCH. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE WAITING IN THE SNOW TO SEE HER. I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER BOLD, THOUGHTFUL POLICY PROPOSALS ON A RANGE OF ISSUES, FROM RAISING TEACHER SALARIES TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER STRENGTH OF CHARACTER, HER TOUGHNESS, HER RESOLVE. I SAW IN HER NOT ONLY A FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO COULD PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT, AS HER CAMPAIGN LIKES TO SAY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS A TOUGH, DISCIPLINED, SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL NOT ONLY PROSECUTE THE CASE BUT WILL TRY TO CONVICT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ABANDONING OUR COUNTRY, THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR VALUES. [APPLAUSE] I AM A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AND I CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES BUT TO BE HONEST I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NUANCED POLICY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THIS TIME. WE KNOW WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR. WE KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WE KNOW OUR COUNTRY IS IN PERIL. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN WIN, PURE AND SIMPLE. ELECTABILITY IS WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ABOUT AND I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS THE MOST ELECTABLE CANDIDATE. I BELIEVE SHE CAN INSPIRE AND TURN OUT THE BASE, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT MILLENIALS, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT PEOPLE OF COLOR, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT WOMEN, INSPIRE AND TURN OUT VOTERS IN THE HEARTLAND WHO FELT DISENFRANCHISED AND VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP ONLY TO BE STABBED IN THE BACK BY POLICIES THAT FAVOR THE RICH. PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, AND LISTEN TO THESE WORDS BECAUSE THIS IS CRITICAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER YOUR CANDIDATES, IN AN ELECTION WHERE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO WIN OVER MODERATE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE QUITE LITERALLY , BY THE DAILY IGNORANCE AND CRUELTY AND EMBARRASSMENT THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE INFLICTED ON OUR COUNTRY, KAMALA HARRIS CAN TURN OUT AND INSPIRE THOSE VOTERS, TOO. THAT IS WHERE THE ELECTION WILL BE WON OR LOST. I WANT TO SEE KAMALA HARRIS ON A DEBATE STAGE SQUARING OFF AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY FOR DECADES AND I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SUPPORTING AND GETTING TO KNOW MANY FINE CANDIDATES. BUT I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU I HAVE NEVER, EVER FELT MORE STRONGLY ABOUT A CANDIDATE THAN I DO THIS TIME. BECAUSE WINNING WAS NEVER, EVER MORE IMPORTANT THAT IT IS THIS TIME. KAMALA HARRIS CAN WIN. IF WE ARE SMART ENOUGH TO NOMINATE HER, SHE WILL. FRIENDS, MY CHOICE, AND I HOPE YOURS, FOR OUR PARTY'S NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. [APPLAUSE] I WANT TO THANK YOU PUBLICLY, AND I HOPE I DO OFTEN ENOUGH PRIVATELY, FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR YOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND THOSE WHO REALLY TAKE THAT CALLING SERIOUSLY, WHETHER THEY ARE IN ELECTED OFFICE OR NOT, THEY CONTINUE TO SERVE. YOUR WORDS AND YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR ADVICE, YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT MEAN THE WORLD TO ME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE] GREETINGS TO ALL OF THE ELECTIVES THAT ARE HERE, I DON'T HAVE THE LIST, OTHERWISE I WOULD READ ALL OF YOUR NAMES. BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THESE YEARS, THESE LAST FEW YEARS AS A DEMOCRAT IN ELECTED OFFICE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING FOR MANY REASONS, BUT INCLUDED IN THAT IS WE WHO HOLD ELECTED OFFICE, OUR FRIENDS AND FELLOW DEMOCRATS WHO OFTEN LOOK IN OUR EYES AND SEARCH OUR EYES TO BE CONVINCED THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE OK. [LAUGHTER] THEY WANT US TO ENSURE THEM AND EVEN WHEN WE ARE WEARY AND TIRED AND SET UP, WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND CONTINUE TO INSPIRE, AND THE WORK OF THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE WORK OF HAVING , HAVING BEEN ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. [APPLAUSE] IT IS THE WORK OF UPLIFTING THE SENATOR. I CONGRATULATE YOU, BECAUSE TRULY THE WORK OF THE PARTY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE LOCAL CHAPTERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THAT IS WHAT IS HOLDING US UP AS A PARTY , NATIONALLY, AND FRANKLY, AS A COUNTRY. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU. EACH OF YOU VOLUNTEERS YOUR TIME. YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK. YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. THERE IS SO MUCH ATTACKING OUR DEMOCRACY, INCLUDING OUR ELECTIONS PROCESS. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO. THE WORK YOU DO IS KNOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE WORK YOU DO IS ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAMES. BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR WORK, THEIR LIVES ARE BETTER AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPROVED. SO THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. THERE IS A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THIS , I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION, AND JOE, YOU SAID IT SO WELL, THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS DEMOCRATS , IF CHILDREN EVER ASK YOU, WHAT IS THE WELL, THE CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN, IT IS ALWAYS AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION. AT ITS CORE, I THINK ONE OF THE BASIC POINTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE IS WE REALLY ARE FOR THE PEOPLE. WE REALLY ARE. WE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE. WE FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAVE POWER, BUT THE POWER WE KNOW IS IN THEM. WE ARE A PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS ABOUT LIFTING PEOPLE UP. WE ARE A PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL SYSTEMS TO GIVE EACH INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY AND RESPECT. WE ARE THE PARTY THAT IS ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS. AND WE ARE THE PARTY WHO WRITE DOWN, I BELIEVE, IS FIGHTING NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS, BUT FIGHTING IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THESE UNITED STATES. JOE, AS YOU SAID, ALL OF US HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE REPUBLICANS, COLLEAGUES, PEOPLE WE ADORE AND LOVE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARTY , I DO BELIEVE IT IS OUR BURDEN AND ARE CALLING TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, AND I KNOW WE ARE UP TO IT. THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK THE QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING, WHO ARE WE? I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT WE WILL. AS WE KNOW OVER THESE LAST 2.5 YEARS, IT EXTENDS BACK TO THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE HAVE BEEN DESPONDENT. WE HAVE BEEN UPSET. WE HAVE BEEN ANGRY, WE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RANGE OF EMOTIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME THAT WE MUST HOLD ONTO IS THE CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING THAT WHEN WE FIGHT, WE WIN. HERE IS THE THING , WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PLACE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW, WE MUST REMEMBER AS OVERWHELMED, AS UPSET AS WE MUST FEEL, WE ARE ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD FIGHT. [LAUGHTER] IN FACT, NOTHING WE HAVE ACHIEVED BY WAY OF SUCCESS IN OUR DEMOCRACY, AND FOR THE SAKE OF DEMOCRACY, HAS COME TO US WITHOUT A GOOD FIGHT , NOTHING. WE WERE BORN OUT OF A FIGHT AS A NATION. LET'S REMEMBER THAT. SOMETIMES I REFLECT ON MANY OF THE WISE ONES BEFORE US AND I WILL PARAPHRASE, BUT CARETTA SCOTT KING FAMOUSLY SAID THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, WHICH IS THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND FREEDOM, SHE SAID THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS MUST BE FOUGHT AND WON WITH EACH ITERATION. I THINK SHE HAD TWO POINTS WHEN SHE SAID THAT. ONE IS IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF THIS FIGHT THAT WHATEVER GAINS WE MAKE, THEY WILL NOT BE PERMANENT. IT IS THE NATURE OF IT. THE SECOND POINT IS, UNDERSTANDING IT IS THE NATURE OF IT, DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED. DO NOT THROW UP OUR HANDS WHAT IT IS TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. IT IS THE VERY NATURE OF IT. IF I WERE TO OVERSIMPLIFY IT, WHEN YOUR NAILS START GROWING, I DON'T SAY OH MY GOD, MY NAILS ARE GROWING, YOU JUST CUT THEM. [LAUGHTER] RIGHT? WE HAVE A TEST BEFORE US. WE ARE UP FOR IT. WE ARE UP FOR THIS. WE ARE UP TO THE TASK OF FIGHTING FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, AND AS A COUNTRY, AND AS A PEOPLE. WE ARE UP FOR THIS. SO LET'S JUST GET OUT THERE AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING HISTORICALLY HERE IN PORTSMOUTH. HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF MY OWN PERSONAL BACKGROUND. WE ARE NOT ONLY A NATION OF FIGHTERS, I WAS BORN TO FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WITH A WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IN THE 1960'S. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I JOKED THAT WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO SPENT TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE. OF THE MANY HEROES OF THAT GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THERE WERE LAWYERS, PEOPLE LIKE THURGOOD MARSHALL AND THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTOOD THE SKILL OF THE PROFESSION OF LAW, TO TRANSLATE THE PASSION FROM THE STREETS TO THE COURTROOMS OF OUR COUNTRY. AND DO THE WORK WE KNOW MUST CONSTANTLY BE DONE OF REMINDING PEOPLE OF THE PROMISE WE ARTICULATED IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. THEY WERE THE HEROES OF MY CHILDHOOD. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER. IT WAS A COMMUNITY OF FIGHTERS. MY MOTHER WAS ALSO EXTRAORDINARY. SHE RAISED ME AND MY SISTER. MY MOTHER WAS A SCIENTIST. ONE OF THE VERY FEW AT THE TIME, AND STILL, WOMEN OF COLOR IN SCIENCE. HER SPECIALTY WAS BREAST CANCER RESEARCH. MY MOTHER HAD TWO GOALS IN HER LIFE , TO RAISE HER DAUGHTERS AND AND BREAST CANCER. I RIVER HER COMING HOME AND FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH RIGHTS. FIGHTERS, WE ARE ALL BORN OF A NATION, AND MANY OF US PARENTS, WHO ARE FIGHTERS. MY MOTHER, SHE WAS A TOUGH COOKIE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY TO US, YOU WILL BE JUDGED BASED ON THE LIVES THAT YOU TOUCH AND THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE. IT WILL NOT BE ABOUT SELF-SERVICE. IT IS THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE AND LIFT UP. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY DON'T YOU EVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. MY MOTHER WOULD SAY TO ME MANY TIMES, YOU MAY BE THE FIRST TO DO MANY THINGS, MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT THE LAST. [LAUGHTER] SHE WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME IN OUR HOUSE COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYTHING , HER MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU , SHE WAS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL, BY THE WAY. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. SHE WOULD LOOK AT YOU IF YOU ARE COMPLAINING AND WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND MAYBE ONE HAND ON HER HIP AND SAY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I THINK WE ARE ALL HERE FOR A SIMILAR REASON, BY THE WAY, WE ARE NOT TO SIT , WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO SIT AT HOME AND COMPLAIN. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE WE ARE PREPARED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT, THIS ELECTION, WHAT IS BEFORE US IN 2020. JOE TALKED ABOUT IT. YOU WERE INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT IN THE WAY YOU CONTEXTUALIZED IT. WE HAVE A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HAS DEBASED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I STARTED MY CAREER AS A PROSECUTOR IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT EARL WARREN ONCE RAN. THE SYMMETRY IN TERMS OF MY LIFE IS I ACTUALLY STARTED MY CAREER IN THE OFFICE OF A GREAT AMERICAN WHO, WHEN HE WAS THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDED THE DESEGREGATION OF AMERICA'S SCHOOLS WAS SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IF WE ARE GOING TO BE TRUE TO THE VALUES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT HE SAID IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS NOT BE 55 , 5-4, 6-3, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE UNANIMOUS UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDE THIS CASE. THE COMMITMENT HE PUT INTO IT TO ENSURE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY WOULD DECIDE TO DESEGREGATE CLASSROOMS AND UNITED STATES. THE SYMMETRY OF THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED. HE DID THAT, WHICH ALLOWED ME TO STAND IN FRONT OF YOU AS A SERIOUS CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE AD STATES. , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I WAS 22 WHEN I STARTED THAT WORK. I LEARNED THAT WITH THE SWIPE OF MY PEN I COULD CHARGE SOMEONE WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OFFENSE, AND BECAUSE OF THE SWIPE OF MY PEN, THAT PERSON COULD BE ARRESTED, THEY COULD SIT IN JAIL FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS, THEY COULD LOSE TIME FROM WORK AND THEIR FAMILY MIGHT LOSE THEIR JOB, THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HIRE A LAWYER, THEY WOULD LOSE STANDING IN THEIR COMMUNITY, ALL BECAUSE OF THE SWIPE OF MY PEN. WEEKS LATER, I COULD DISMISS THE CHARGES BUT THEIR LIFE WOULD FOREVER BE CHANGED. I LEARNED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE THE POWER, THE POWER TO IMPACT REAL HUMAN BEINGS THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE HOLD THESE OFFICES. I WAS JUST A LOWLY DEPUTY DA. WE HAVE A PERSON IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO HOLDS THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO DOES NOT FULLY, OR EVEN PARTIALLY, UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE POWER. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. HE GOES AROUND SWINGING WHAT HE THINKS IS HIS POWER, BUT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POWERFUL. WHEN YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POWERFUL, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE GREATEST MEASURE OF YOUR STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. THIS IS THE NATURE AND THE CHARACTER OF THE GUY WE HAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THEN, OF COURSE, HE CAME INTO OFFICE ON A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS ABOUT MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. FOR SOME OF US, THAT REQUIRED A QUESTION, FOR WHOM? FOR ALL OF US, IT MAY CLEAR, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SOMETHING. OF COURSE, WE ALL ASKED, BACK TO WHAT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING ACTS RIGHT? BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BACK BEFORE TITLE IX? BACK BEFORE FEDERAL NUMERAL WAGE? WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. THE POINT THAT WE ALL KNOW, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE ORGANIZED HERE TONIGHT, RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT TO WHAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT MANY MONTHS. WE ALL KNOW, NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT GOING BACK, BUT IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE ON THIS GUY. IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE. YES, JOE, IN ORDER TO DO THAT, HE MUST BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP AND IT WILL TAKE A PROSECUTOR TO DO IT. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE WORKING WITH A PRETTY GOOD RAP SHEET. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ON THAT SHEET. HE CAME INTO OFFICE MAKING ALL KINDS OF PROMISES TO WORKING PEOPLE. HE SAID I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU. I HAVE YOU. WHAT IF HE DO? HE PASSES A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA, SADDLING US WITH A $1.5 TRILLION DEFICIT. THEY PLAN ON PAYING FOR THAT BY CUTTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. WHAT DID HE DO? HE CAME IN SAYING I AM GOING TO HELP YOU, I AM GOING TO BUILD UP INFRASTRUCTURE. REMEMBER INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK? I GUESS WE ALL JUST SLEPT THAT WEEK BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER] HE CAME IN SAYING HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HEALTH CARE AND THEN HE TRIED TO UNDO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND IF NOT FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN JOHN MCCAIN, IT WOULD HAVE HAPPEN. [APPLAUSE] HE CAME IN TALKING ABOUT HE WAS GOING TO HELP WORKING PEOPLE, FROM FARMERS TO AUTOWORKERS, AND THEN PASSES SOME KIND OF TRADE POLICY, AS HE CAUSED IT, TRADE POLICY BY TWEET, UNILATERAL ACTION BORN OUT OF A FRAGILE EGO, THAT HAS RESULTED IN FARMERS AROUND THE COUNTRY , I AM SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN IOWA, FARMERS IN IOWA WHO ARE LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOYBEANS ROTTING IN BINS. OVER THE LAST DECADE OR MORE THEY BUILT UP A MARKET TO SELL TO CHINA THAT HAS BEEN CUT OFF FROM THEM. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR AUTOWORKERS TO BE OUT OF A JOB BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE AMERICAN FAMILY IS EXPECTED TO PAY $1000 MORE PER YEAR FOR EVERYTHING FROM CHILDREN'S TOYS TO WASHING MACHINES. I CALL IT THE TRUMP TRADE TAX. HE BETRAYED A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHAT IS ON THAT RAP SHEET? WE CAN LOOK AT THE FACT THERE IS A POLICY ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES, SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY, IN FACT WHAT IT WAS WAS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THERE IS PLENTY TO PROSECUTE THAT CASE, INCLUDING, MOST RECENTLY, JUST THIS WEEK, WHEN GUESS WHAT REPUBLICANS, IF YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE TAKING MONEY FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING HIM AND BEING APOLOGISTS, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE THAT ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE FACT HE HAS TAKEN THEIR FEDERAL DOLLARS, INCLUDING MONEY FROM MILITARY FAMILIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS TO PAY FOR HIS VANITY PROJECT CALLED A WALL, WHICH BY THE WAY, GUYS, WE'LL NEVER GET BUILT. [APPLAUSE] SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THE CASE AGAINST FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP, AND IN SO DOING TURN THE PAGE. WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO ALL OF THE FRIENDS HERE IS THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN THAT. IT HAS TO BE MORE THAN THAT. HERE IS THE THING, EVEN IF NOVEMBER OF 2016 TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY, WE WOULD STILL BE A NATION INFLUX AND A WORLD INFLUX. WE WOULD STILL BE LOOKING AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE SEEING ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD, SHIFTING POPULATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WHERE THERE IS DROUGHT THERE WILL BE FAMINE AND PEOPLE WILL MOVE TO PLACES THEY HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN, THAT SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND PRAY TO A DIFFERENT GOD, WHICH WILL RESULT IN CONFLICT, WHICH WILL RESULT IN WAR. WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT A MOMENT IN TIME OR WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A NATION AND A WORLD OF AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, ALSO KNOWN AS THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION. WE ARE A NATION IN FLUX AND A WORLD IN FLUX, AND THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS WHAT WILL BE OUR STANDING? WHAT IS OUR STRENGTH? WHAT WILL BE OUR DEFINITION AND ROLE IN THIS WORLD? THESE QUESTIONS ARE THE QUESTIONS I BELIEVE THAT ARE BEFORE US. TO MAKE THE POINT VERY SIMPLE ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE, AS YOU KNOW I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND NEVADA. I WAS IN NEVADA ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I ENDED UP HAVING AN EVENT THAT WAS TOWARD MY END OF TIME THERE IN LAS VEGAS ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, AND I WAS MAKING A POINT , THE POINT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE. I GOT A LITTLE CASUAL. THE POINT IS OBVIOUS, DUDE HAS GOT TO GO. [LAUGHTER] AT WHICH POINT, BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT WAS A SATURDAY NET IN LAS VEGAS, THE WHOLE CROWD STARTS CHANTING DUDE GOTTA GO. DUDE GOTTA GO IS AN OBVIOUS POINT. THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS AS WE TURN THE PAGE ON THAT POINT, THE ISSUE BEFORE US AS LEADERS IS WHAT WE MUST DO TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT , I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN AND WE AS DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN. IT HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE NOT DEBATABLE BUT DO REQUIRE US TO ADDRESS. JOE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS ERA WHERE WE HAVE A LEADER WHO USED HIS POWER, AND WE HAVE ALL SEEN IT, IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT SEWING HATE AND DIVISION. HAVING US POINT FINGERS AT EACH OTHER. I STILL REJECT THAT. THIS IS A MOMENT WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. INSTEAD OF SOME DEMOCRAT SUGGESTING THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MIDWEST YOU HAVE ONE CONVERSATION AND WHEN YOU ARE IN NEW ENGLAND YOU HAVE ANOTHER. WHEN YOU GO DOWN SOUTH THAT IS A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. WE ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IF WE START DOING THAT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MUST DO IN WRITING THE NEXT CHAPTER BASED ON THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, I BELIEVE WE MUST DO THAT WITH A SPIRIT THAT IN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS AGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WE MUST KNOW THAT, AND FEEL THAT, AND LET THAT MOTIVATE OUR PRIORITIES. [APPLAUSE] HERE IS HOW I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE, I KNOW IT BASED ON EVERY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE. I KNOW IT TO BE TRUE BASED ON THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. SOME PEOPLE CALL THAT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT., SOME PEOPLE REFER TO THAT AS THE WITCHING HOUR. WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THAT THOUGHT THAT HAS BEEN WEIGHING ON YOU. SOMETIMES IN A COLD SWEAT. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY FOR WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHIC. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT USUALLY HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS , OUR PERSONAL HEALTH, HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN OR PARENTS, FOR SUMMARY AMERICANS, CAN I GET A JOB, CAN I PAY THE BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH, CAN I RETIRE WITH DIGNITY, CAN I PAY OFF MY STUDENT LOANS, CAN I HELP MY FAMILY NEVER GET OFF THEIR OPIOID ADDICTION? FOR SO MANY SENIORS, CANNOT EITHER FILL MY REFRIGERATOR MY PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE I CANNOT DO BOTH? THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR ROLE AS DEMOCRATS, AND AS LEADERS, NOT ONLY THOSE OF US IN THIS ROOM, LEADERS OF OUR PARTY, BUT AS LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WOULD REMIND US THAT ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS IS WHEN WE APPROACH THE FIGHT BEFORE US IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT POINT AND THEN FIGHTING FOR THE COMMONALITY. A LARGE PART OF MY PRIORITIES ARE BORN OUT OF THAT. WHEN FIGHTING FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THAT MIGHT REALLY BE THE BEST STARTING POINT. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT WAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF US IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND LET'S ADDRESS THOSE IN A WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN A WAY THAT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND AMERICA. KAMALA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OK. IN AMERICA TODAY, MOST HALF OF FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD A $400 UNEXPECTED EXPENSE. IN AMERICA TODAY, AND 99% OF THE COUNTIES IF YOU ARE A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WORKING FULL-TIME, YOU CANNOT AFFORD A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. PEOPLE TOOK OUT LOANS FROM PAYDAY LENDERS AT AN EXCESS OF 300%. WHILE THIS GUY IS WALKING AROUND CROWING ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEING GREAT, AND YOU ASK HOW ARE YOU MEASURING THE SO-CALLED GREATNESS OF THIS ECONOMY OF YOURS AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET, THAT IS FINE IF YOU OWN STOCKS. 72% OF THE STOCKS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE OWNED BY THE TOP 10%. WE SAID DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEASURE? THE TALK ABOUT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. YES, I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING OUR COUNTRY AND I WILL TELL YOU, INDEED, PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AS DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN. WE HAVE ALWAYS FOUGHT AS A PARTY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. I AM A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, AS ARE SO MANY OF US. THERE ARE THREE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC SAFETY, PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGE WE FACE AS A NATION, WHICH INCLUDES THE CHALLENGE TO COMPETE WITH OUR FRIENDS AND FOES AROUND THE GLOBE, LET'S FOCUS ON INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND REMEMBERING THAT ONE OF THE SMARTEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND LET'S START WITH PAYING OUR TEACHERS. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL PUT IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, $13,500 PER YEAR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT 13,500 DOLLARS PER YEAR MEANS FOR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY? IT IS A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. A YEARS WORTH OF GROCERIES. PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT INTO STUDENT LOANS. I WANT TO MAKE A FINE POINT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. I STRONGLY BELIEVE, AND AS DEMOCRATS WE BELIEVE, SHOULD JUDGE A SOCIETY BASED ON HOW IT TREATS ITS CHILDREN. [APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE THAT A SOCIETY CAN EXTEND TOWARD ITS CHILDREN IS TO INVEST IN THEIR EDUCATION, AND BY EXTENSION, THEIR TEACHERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE. LET'S AGREE THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VALUE OF OURS AS DEMOCRATS THAT HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT, AT NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE FEW WHO CAN AFFORD IT. GOING BACK TO THE THREE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, IF WE ARE TO HAVE A THRIVING DEMOCRACY AND A THRIVING REPUBLIC, PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH MUST BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES. YET TODAY IN AMERICA, 30 MILLION PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. PEOPLE SAY TO ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOUR MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A CARE FOR ALL, NOWHERE TAKES PLACE? IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, I PROPOSE WE HAVE A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN THAT BRINGS COSTS DOWN, THE COVERS EVERYONE, INCLUDING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND, THIS IS A POINT OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN MIND AND OTHERS, THAT GIVES PEOPLE CHOICE, SO YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF A MEDICARE PUBLIC PLAN OR MEDICARE PRIVATE PLAN. BUT LET'S ALSO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE, THAT IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT FOR SO LONG HAS BEEN IMPEDED BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS PRESIDENT WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE BACK POCKET OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THE GOVERNMENT WILL FIGHT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT PRIVATE INTEREST AND PROFIT. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, AND WE DID A TOWN HALL RECENTLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND ROLLED OUT OUR CLIMATE PLAN, I WILL TELL YOU, AND THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE THAT WE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, HAVE CREATED THIS CLIMATE CRISIS AND WE, AS HUMAN BEINGS, CAN SOLVE IT. WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE IN OUR LIFESTYLES. BUT IN A WAY THAT CAN HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT. I HAVE TWO BABY NIECES. ONE IS 1.5 YEARS OLD AND THE OTHER IS 3. WHEN I LOOK IN THEIR EYES, WHEN I WATCH THEM PLAY AND THEN I THINK ABOUT THE U.N. REPORT AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR IN TELLING US, AS SCIENCE TELLS US, IF BY 12 YEARS BY NOW WE DO NOTHING, IT WILL BE IRREVERSIBLE. I DON'T LIKE TO BLAME REPUBLICANS, IT IS TOO EASY, RIGHT? BUT ON THIS ISSUE, GUYS, HAVING BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE 2.5 YEARS, THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP IS PROFOUND. I KID YOU NOT, I JOINED THE UNITED STATES SENATE 2.5 YEARS AGO, I WAS PART OF A HEARING IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS WHERE THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE HEARING WAS TO DEBATE WHETHER SCIENCE SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF PUBLIC POLICY. [LAUGHTER] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AND THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR, WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT CHILDREN MUST BE ABLE TO DRINK CLEAN WATER AND BREATHE CLEAN AIR AND NOT BE IMPEDED BY TOXIC CHEMICALS. WE MUST STAND UP TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. [APPLAUSE] IN THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WE WILL AGREE, AS DEMOCRATS, THAT ONE OF OUR FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE NATIONAL SECURITY. WE WILL AGREE THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLES OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS TO CONCERN HERSELF , [APPLAUSE] WITH OUR NATION AND HOMELAND SECURITY, AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FACT OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE OF THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF AN AMERICAN STUDENT WHO WAS TORTURED AND LATER DIED, PREFERS TO TAKE THE WORD OF A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THAT ON THE SUBJECT OF A JOURNALIST WHO WAS ASSASSINATED, AND JOURNALIST WHO HAD AMERICAN CREDENTIALS, PREFERRED TO TAKE THE WORD OF A SAUDI PRINCE OVER THE WORD OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. WE NEED A NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. [APPLAUSE] I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES THE DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR, THE RANGE GOES FROM ALL THAT WE MUST DO AROUND REFORM OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO PASSING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, TO PAYING WOMEN EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK, I COULD GO DOWN THE LIST. CONTINUING TO FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, NOT BEING SATISFIED UNTIL EVERYONE HAS EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. I COULD GO ON AND ON. BUT I WILL END MY POINT WITH THIS. OVER THE LAST 2.5 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN, YES, DESPONDENT. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THROWING OBJECTS AT THAT INANIMATE OBJECT CALLED A TV. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH. WE MUST, IN THIS MARCH TOWARD 2020, LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION AND A PEOPLE IS THAT WE, BY OUR VERY NATURE, WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS. THE IDEALS THAT WERE PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AT ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE DECLARATION, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776. WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED, AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AS DEMOCRATS. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE IS WE ALWAYS FIGHT TO GET THERE. FIGHT, WE WILL. AND FIGHT, WE MUST. KNOWING THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORED OUT OF OPTIMISM. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING AND HAVING FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY AND THIS IS A FIGHT WE WILL WIN. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2019] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY.

CSPANKH79201911	Kamala Harris	2019-09-07	Senator Harris at New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention	WHAT IS UP, NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS? HELLO, WHAT IS UP? IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH A BUNCH OF INCREDIBLE DEMOCRATS. HELLO, EVERYBODY! [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COME ON, WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. OH, THANK YOU. HELLO, EVERYONE. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE AMERICAN LEADERS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR ALL YOU DO OVER SO MANY YEARS, ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE TO INSPIRE ALL OF US AROUND THE COUNTRY. I AM HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU IN PARTICULAR FOR SENDING JEANNE SHAHEEN AND MAGGIE HASSAN TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. NEW HAMPSHIRE KNOWS HOW TO ELECT SOME REALLY STRONG WOMEN. [LAUGHTER] SO, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, I THINK WE ALL KNOW, THIS IS A VERY PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT WHILE WE ARE ALL HERE WORKING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOLFING. SO, JUST DO THAT SPLIT SCREEN. [LAUGHTER] LET US JUST TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS LEADING, NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATS, BUT ON BEHALF OF ALL AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME , I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US EACH, AS INDIVIDUALS AND COLLECTIVELY, TO LOOK IN A MIRROR AND ASK A QUESTION. THAT QUESTION BEING , WHO ARE WE? AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERING] SO, THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME THAT IS REQUIRING US TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AND FIGHT DEMOCRATS, WE WILL. , AND FIGHT, DEMOCRATS, WE WILL. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW FIGHT FOR US. I KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DESPOND AND, OVERWHELMED, FRUSTRATED, ANGRY , BUT LET US REMEMBER, EVERY GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AS A NATION CAME OUT OF A GOOD FIGHT. WE ARE UP FOR A GOOD FIGHT. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I COME FROM A FAMILY OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN THE 1960'S. MY SISTER AND I JOKE THAT WE WERE SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF ADULTS THAT SPENT FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS IN CALLED JUSTICE. FIGHTING, FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY. FIGHTING FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I WAS RAISED BY A MOTHER WHO IS ALL OF FIVE FEET TALL BUT IF YOU HAD EVER MET HER YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT SHE WAS 10 FEET TALL. AND SHE WAS TOUGH. SHE WOULD SAY , KAMALA, YOU ARE GOING TO BE JUDGED ON THE LIFE OF SERVICE YOU LIVE. NOT SELF-SERVICE. BUT SERVICE TO OTHERS. BUT SHE WAS TOUGH. SHE WAS TOUGH. IF YOU EVER CAME HOME COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING, COMPLAINING, OUR MOTHER WOULD LOOK AT YOU WITH A STRAIGHT FACE, LAY ONE HAND ON HER HIP, AND SHE'D SAY, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? SO I DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] THERE YOU GO. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR A SECOND. BECAUSE THAT IS CONTEXT. WE'VE GOT A GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO CAMPAIGNED ON A SLOGAN ABOUT "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," WHICH FOR MANY OF US REQUIRES A QUESTION AGAIN EXACTLY FROM WHOM, AND FOR ALL OF US MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SOMETHING. BACK TO WHAT EXACTLY, WE ASKED. BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? BACK BEFORE ROE V. WADE? BACK BEFORE THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT? BACK BACK BEFORE TITLE IX? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING BACK! [APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. [APPLAUSE] SEN. HARRIS: HE CAME INTO OFFICE PROMISING PEOPLE ARE WHOLE LOT OF STUFF. HE PROMISED WORKING PEOPLE THAT HE WAS GOING TO HELP THEM. HE SAID MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, I AM GOING TO HELP YOU OUT, BUT NOW IT IS IN A RECESSION. WE ARE LOOKING AT A RECESSION. THE ONLY THING HE HAS MANUFACTURED IS CHAOS. [APPLAUSE] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD NUMBER OF GLOBAL CRISES THAT THIS GUY HAS GOT US INTO, THAT IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING HE CAN CLAIM TO BE MADE IN THE USA. [APPLAUSE] HE PROMISED PEOPLE HE WOULD GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE, AND THEN SPENT FULL-TIME TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND NOW HAS A BUNCH OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY TRYING TO THE PROTECTIONS WE CREATED AGAINST PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. PROTECTIONS WE CREATED SO OUR 26-YEAR-OLDS COULD BE ON HEALTH COVERAGE. HE MADE ALL KINDS OF PROMISES. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO KEEP FOLKS SAFE. LET ME TELL YOU, I SERVE ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE, I MEET WITH A REGULAR BASIS WITH MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. THIS GUY HAS GOT US ONE TWEET AWAY FROM WAR. [APPLAUSE] SEN. HARRIS: A SO-CALLED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO EMBRACES DICTATORS AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRUE SIGN OF STRENGTH IS NOT BASED ON WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT IS BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. [APPLAUSE] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SAFETY. LET'S TALK ABOUT GUN SAFETY. HE SAYS HE WILL PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEN HE COWERS IN THE FACE OF THE N.R.A., AND WE CAN THANK GOVERNOR SUNUNU FOR TAKING SOME HEAT APPARENTLY AND THINKING THAT IS THE WAY SOME LEADERS SHOULD LEAD. NO, THAT IS NOT THE WAY LEADERS SHOULD LEAD. THE WAY LEADERS LEAD IS TO PROTECT OUR BABIES, BE THEM ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THEN SAY TO THEM, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ENDURE THOSE DRILLS, WE WILL PROTECT YOU. WE WILL STAND STRONG AGAINST THE N.R.A. AND PASS GUN SAFETY LAWS INCLUDING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL PROTECT OUR BABIES. THAT IS WHAT LEADERS DO. SO, HERE'S THE THING. WE HAVE HAD TO ENDURE SOME POWERFUL FORCES FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE. A PRESIDENT WHO IS TRYING TO SOW HATE AMONG US. BY SAY, DEMOCRATS, IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020 LET'S REMEMBER A COUPLE OF THINGS,. ONE, LET'S KNOW WHAT OUR HEARTS AND WITH OUR SOULS AND LET IT FUEL US, THAT IN THE FACE OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DIVIDE, WE AS DEMOCRATS KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [APPLAUSE] NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, NO MATTER YOUR AGE, YOUR GENDER, NO MATTER THE GOD YOU LOVE OR PRAY TO, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW IT. I CALL IT THE 3:00 IN THE MORNING THOUGHT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAS NOT STUFF THAT HAS BEEN WAITING ON YOU. WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH WE ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WHEN WE WAKE UP THINKING THAT THOUGHT, IT IS NEVER THROUGH THE LENS OF SOME SIMPLISTIC DEMOGRAPHICS THE POLLS PUT US IN. AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US, IT HAS TO DO WITH ONE OF JUST A VERY FEW THINGS, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN'S SAFETY, THEIR ABILITY TO GET AN EDUCATION AND THRIVE, OUR ABILITY TO PAY BILLS BY THE END OF THE MONTH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. SO LET IT FUEL US IN OUR MARCH TOWARD 2020. AND LET US REMEMBER THAT ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION IS THAT WE BY OUR NATURE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON NOBLE IDEALS, PRESENT WHEN WE WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL OF ITS AMENDMENTS, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THOSE WORDS WE SPOKE IN 1776, THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL AND SHOULD BE TREATED THAT WAY. WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL. WE ARE ALSO CLEAR EYED. WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THOSE IDEALS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE, FIGHT TO GET FAIR. AND THIS, THEN, IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF OPTIMISM, OF A FIGHT BORN OUT OF KNOWING AND BELIEVING AND HAVING FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THIS IS A FIGHT NOT ONLY FOR THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, THIS IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A FIGHT NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS, THAT WE WILL WIN.

CSPANKH2211201912	Kamala Harris	2019-11-22	Kamala Harris Meets with Voters in Muscatine, Iowa	HOW ARE YOU DOING. I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD START TELLING JOKES. [LAUGHTER] I'LL JUST SPEAK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU, SHANNON, THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. AND YOU'VE BEEN SO HELPFUL AND YOU WORK SO HARD AND CAN WE PLEASE HERE IT FOR SHANNON. [APPLAUSE] THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT THIS MOMENT THAT IS TRULY ABOUT A FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY AND WHEN YOU DO WHAT YOU DO, BY BEING HERE THIS EVENING FOR THANKSGIVING WEEK AND THE SUMMONING OF THE THINGS YOU CAN BE DOING, IT SHOULD REMIND US THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY THE MATTER WHO'S TRYING TO TEAR US APART HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PEOPLE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PEOPLE AND THAT POWER AND WE REMEMBER THE POWER IS TRULY IN THE PEOPLE AND WHEN WE DO AND WHAT YOU DO THE KIND OF THINGS WE ARE DOING, BE OUT THERE AND BE ACTIVE, IT'S A SIGN, IT'S A BAROMETER THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS HEALTHY AND ALIVE. LET'S REMEMBER THAT AND THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING PART OF IT. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU A FEW OF MY THOUGHTS AND SOME OF MY PLANS AND I WILL PASS ON THE MICROPHONE. BUT TRULY I DO BELIEVE WE ARE IN A FIGHT. WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. I THINK WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. I BELIEVE WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR OUR RULE OF LAW. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WE JUST ALL WATCH THIS WEEK OF HEARINGS AND ADJUSTED A BUNCH OF PRESS INTERVIEWS AND I EXPLAINED ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS THAT WE SHOULD ALL LEAVE WITH IT THE END OF THIS WEEK, A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, THAT THERE ARE REALLY GREAT PEOPLE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, CAREER PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN THE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I'M THE ONLY PERSON ON THE DEBATE STAGE RESERVES IN THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THERE ARE GREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THE SERVICE OF OUR NATION AND THEY WERE ON DISPLAY THIS WEEK. THE SECOND TAKE AWAY HIS THERE'S CLEARLY A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE OF FOOT. WHAT BECAME EXPOSED AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS IS WE NEED TO HAUL INTO CONGRESS IN HERE FROM ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE CLEARLY IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, BUT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF. AND THEN THERE IS RUDY WHO THINKS -- I THINK RUDY NEEDS TO REMIND HE'S A LAWYER AND HAS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. [LAUGHTER] SO THERE IS A FIGHT IN FRONT OF US. A FIGHT FOR ALL THESE THINGS WE HOLD DEAR AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT MAKE US STRONG. WE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT WITH THAT. THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW ARE WE GOING TO WIN? BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT AND KNOW HOW TO WIN AND WE LIKE TO WIN. IT'S A WIN I BELIEVE, WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE. OF OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE RIGHT NOW IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN DONALD TRUMP. SO WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE AND KNOWING THAT, PREENED BACK YESTERDAY IS KNOCKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TOMORROW. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE GAINED SOME TRACTION IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US AND WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS. REMINDING PEOPLE THAT WITHIN THE BEAUTY OF THIS DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THEN WHAT SEPARATES US AND TO WIN, WE WILL NEED SOMEONE ON THAT DEBATE STAGE WHO CAN GO TOE TO TO AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING AT HER. [APPLAUSE] I'VE TAKEN ON JEFF SESSIONS, TAKEN ON BILL BARR, BRETT KAVANAUGH, I CAN TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. [APPLAUSE] SO WE NEED TO WIN. WE NEED TO DO THIS IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE AND SO THIS IS A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE. AND AS MANY OF YOU MIGHT KNOW, I STARTED MY CAREER -- MY SISTER AND I GREW UP AROUND FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR JUSTICE. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM LAW SCHOOL MY MOM AND MY SISTER SAID WHAT YOU CAN IT DO IN YOUR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND I SAID I'VE DECIDED I'M TO BE A PROSECUTOR BECAUSE I WANT TO GO INSIDE OF A SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE WORK OF JUSTICE BUT HAS OFTEN DONE THE WORK OF INJUSTICE AND BE ABLE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE I CAN AFFECT REFORM BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE A VOICE FOR THE VULNERABLE. AND SO I STARTED MY CAREER, THE FIRST DAY WALKING INTO A COURTROOM SAYING FIVE WORDS, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT PHRASE FOR THE PEOPLE REALLY IN TWO WAYS I BELIEVE IS THE SYSTEM OF OUR JUSTICE. ONE, IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WE HAVE RIGHTLY SAID A HARM AGAINST ANYONE OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US AND IN THAT WAY WE SAY AND THEREFORE NO ONE SHOULD BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. FOR THE PEOPLE, IT MEANS ALL THE PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE OR GENDER, REGARDLESS OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY, REGARDLESS OF THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS. IT'S ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE AND SO I STARTED THIS CAREER IN A COURTROOM ON SPECIALIZING FOR YEARS ON TRYING TO GET -- HELP WOMEN AND CHILDREN, KNOWING THEY DESERVE A VOICE THAT GAVE THEM STRENGTH AND DIGNITY WITHOUT JUDGMENT. FOR THE PEOPLE, I WAS ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND CREATED INITIATIVES THAT WERE ABOUT SAYING THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS A FANTASY THAT LED TO AMERICA'S SHAME OF MASS INCARCERATION AND SO I STARTED PROGRAMS THAT BECAME NATIONAL MODELS AROUND BRINGING JOBS TO PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL -- ATTORNEY GENERAL CALIFORNIA AND THERE I TOOK ON THE FIVE BIG BANKS THE UNITED STATES WHO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY LENDING BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY THE COST -- CAUSED FORECLOSURES RATHER COUNTRIES WHERE WORKING FAMILIES LOST THEIR HOMES AND IN THAT BATTLE BROUGHT $20 BILLION BACK TO THE STATE ARE REPRESENTED. AND FOR THE PEOPLE, TAKING ON JEFF SESSIONS AND BILL BARR AND BRETT KAVANAUGH AND THOSE WHO NEED TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND TELL THE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT I STAND HERE AND PREPARE TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN THERE IS A FATHER AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IN PLACES AROUND OUR COUNTRY WHO IS SITTING AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AFTER EVERYONE HAS GONE TO SLEEP AND HE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW EVEN THOUGH HE IS WORKING TWO JOBS, HE CAN BARELY GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH AND HE KNOWS HE IS PAYING HIGHER TAXES THAN THE 400 RICHEST FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE THE LARGEST MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT WE'VE HAD IN GENERATIONS, WHICH IS HER FAMILY THAT MAKE LESS THAN $1000 YEAR THEY WILL GET A TAX CREDIT SO THEY CAN TAKE HOME AT $500 A MONTH. PEOPLE SAY HOW ARE YOU TO PAY FOR THAT, THAT'S REALLY SIMPLE. ON DAY ONE WE WILL REPEAL THAT TAX BILL. [APPLAUSE] WHEN IN AMERICA ON ANY GIVEN DAY THERE IS A MOM WHOSE CHILD HAS A FEVER THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL SO SHE GOES TO THE HOSPITAL AND SHE IS LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM BUT DOESN'T WANT TO WALK IN BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, SHE KNOWS IF SHE KNOWS IF YOU WALK THROUGH THOSE DOORS SHE WILL BE OUT OF POCKET. HEALTH CARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY WE NEED MEDICARE FOR ALL, NOT SOME, BUT ALL. I WILL TELL YOU MY PLAN IS A BIT DIFFERENT FOR MY FRIENDS ON THE DEBATE STAGE. YES I'M GOING TO BRING DOWN COSTS, I WILL GET RID OF CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES BUT I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES AND I WON'T TAKE AWAY YOUR CHOICE. I'VE HEARD FROM TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE IS CAN BE COVERED, I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING, EXTENDING BENEFITS TO INCLUDE VISION AND HEARING AND DENTAL. THEY ARE JUST SO EXPENSIVE. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET. SO DOING ALL THAT BUT THE POINT BETWEEN MY PLAN A COUPLE OF FOLKS ON THE STAGE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO GET TO THE PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES, THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON ANYTHING CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND THEY NEED TO COMPETE IN OUR SYSTEM BUT I WON'T TAKE AWAY YOUR CHOICE. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN IN AMERICA WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FACT TEACHERS, TEACHERS HERE IN IOWA AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO TRY AND GET THROUGH THE MONTH WHEN 94% OF THE TEACHERS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO HELP PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES. WHEN TEACHERS ARE ASKED TO MAKE 11% LESS THAN OTHER EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. EDUCATION JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] I'M RUNNING TO PUT IN PLACE WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY FEDERAL INVESTMENT AND CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP. WHICH NATIONALLY IS $13,500 A YEAR. THAT'S A YEARS WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS OR GROCERY BILLS OR PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. I'M HERE TO SAY TO BETSY -- BETSY DEVOS BY THE WAY, TEACHERS DON'T NEED A GUN. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU, WITH YOUR HELP WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND ONE OF THE MOST JOYFUL OF MY FIRST ACT AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN OUR BABIES, I WAS RAISED IN A COMMUNITY TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE, I WAS RAISED IN A COMMUNITY TO BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY. SO WHEN OUR BABIES ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE ENTICE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING TO SCHOOL TO ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY ARE TAUGHT HOW TO HIDE IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THERE IS A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOLS, JUSTICE FOR OUR CHILDREN. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE COURAGE IN LEADERSHIP TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY AND AM GOING TO GIVE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 100 DAYS WHAT LEGISLATION ON MY DESK AND IF THEY DO NOT AND THIS IS A PRIORITIZATION, I WILL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION A COPPERHEADS A BACKGROUND CHECK BEHIND THIS. [APPLAUSE] THERE HAVE BEEN POLICIES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN BABIES BEING PUTTING CAGES AND PARENTS SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES. JUSTICE FOR IMMIGRANTS IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] LET'S REMEMBER, IMMIGRANTS HELPED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND SOMEBODY NEEDS TO REMIND DONALD TRUMP THAT SOME OF HIS CLOSEST RELATIVES. [APPLAUSE] JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN SO MANY WAYS THAT GO TO THE LIST. THE NEED TO REFORM A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHAT WE MUST DO IN TERMS OF FOCUSING ON THE VARIOUS SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE, LEGISLATIVE AND STATES AROUND OUR COUNTRY PUTTING IN PLACE LAWS THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE POSITION FOR ASSISTING A WOMAN WITH EXERCISING THE CHOICE THAT SHE RIGHTLY HAS TO MAKE OVER HER OWN BODY. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. [APPLAUSE] THESE ARE ALL FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT I BELIEVE ARE VERY MUCH FRONT AND CENTER AND AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION IN 2020. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS, AND THIS IS HOW I FEEL DEEPLY, IS WHEN WE OVERCOME THESE VARIOUS INJUSTICES, I DO BELIEVE IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE THE PROTECTION -- POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK AMERICA'S PROMISE. THAT WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO THAT IS THE AMERICA IC -- I SEE. WHEN I'M RUNNING. AND I'M LITERALLY RUNNING. THAT'S WHAT I'M RUNNING TO. THAT IS WHAT I TRULY CAN SEE. SO THAT IS OUR GOAL AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I WILL JUST MAKE A FINAL POINT, WHICH IS -- I'VE BEEN IN THE CAMPAIGN NOW OVER 10 MONTHS AND IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION THERE IS BEEN A CONVERSATION, THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, BUT IT'S THE DONKEY IN THE ROOM, AND IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT ELECTABILITY. LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR A MOMENT. SO THE CONVERSATION GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF AMERICA IS READY FOR A WOMAN OF COLOR TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEN SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL I'M READY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE NEIGHBORS ARE READY. PEOPLE SAY MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR TURN, MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR TIME. I WILL TELL YOU GUYS, THIS IS NOT A NEW CONVERSATION FOR ME. IT'S A CONVERSATION I'VE HEARD IN EVERY CAMPAIGN I'VE HAD AND WON. [APPLAUSE] I SHARE THIS WITH YOU NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME BUT TO SAY EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND IOWANS KNOW THIS, BECAUSE PARTICULARLY YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A LEADER, IN HAVING THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE EVEN WHEN WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE. HAVING THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED. I WILL TELL YOU A QUICK STORY. I'M BEEN A SHARE ONE STORY I'VE GOT WITCHES BEFORE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I SPENT TIME IN IOWA, PARTICULARLY A WEEK BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S IN 2007. AND I WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR A CERTAIN SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND OF COURSE, WHATEVER WAS NEEDED. IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT FOR BOTH CAUCUSES AND THEY WENT TO THE HEADQUARTERS TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE. I SAID THERE'S A SENIOR RESIDENTIAL HOME IN DES MOINES, NO ONE HAS BEEN THERE YET. IT'S THE CORINTHIAN GUARDIANS -- GARDENS SENIOR HOME. CAN YOU GO? AND I SAID OF COURSE. I STARTED KNOCKING ON DOORS AND INVARIABLY SOME LADY WOULD ASK AND SAY -- ANSWER AND SAY COME ON IN, ARE YOU HUNGRY? [LAUGHTER] AND THEN I KNOCKED ON THIS ONE DOOR AND THE LADY ANSWERED THE DOOR AND SHE COULDN'T BEEN MORE THAN FIVE FEET, SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SHE ANSWERED THE DOOR IN THIS PERFECTLY COIFFED WIG AND PERFECT MAKEUP, THIS ELEGANT OUTFIT, I DON'T THINK SHE WAS EXPECTING ANYBODY. I SAID HI, I'M KAMALA HARRIS AND I'M HERE IN THE CAUCUS TOMORROW AND WILL YOU COME OUT AND JOIN AND SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET HIM WIN. AND THEN I SAW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. THIS LADY IN ALL OF HER 85 PLUS YEARS AND WHAT SHE HAS EXPERIENCED AND WITNESSED IN TERMS OF INDIGNITY AND INJUSTICE. AT THIS STAGE OF HER LIFE, SHE WASN'T ABOUT TO VISIT ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT ON HERSELF. SO TO MYSELF I SAID I'M NOT LEAVING HERE AND I STAYED AND I TALKED WITH HER AS SHE TALKED MORE WITH ME AND OPENED THE DOOR A BIT MORE. AND GUESS WHO SHOWED UP AT THE CAUCUS THE NEXT NIGHT AND GUESS WHO WON? SO WHAT WE ARE REQUIRING IS FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY BELIEVE AND KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE. IN CANDOR WE ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS NOT 2007 OR 2008. WE HAVE GOT INTERVENING FACT WHICH IS THAT AWFUL NIGHT IN NOVEMBER OF 2016, IT'S AWFUL. AND IT LINGERS AND THERE WERE SO MANY WHO WORKED SO HARD. IT WAS JOSH OUT OF LOVE AND COUNTRY AND BELIEF THAT WE COLLECT A FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT AND SOME THE OTHER REASONS BELIEVED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HER. AND THEN EXPERIENCED THE GRIEF THAT MANY EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT. THAT IS AN INTERVENING FACT. I AM CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT CAMPAIGN WHO ARE SAYING TODAY MAYBE AMERICA IS NOT READY YET. I KNOW THAT. I AM REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO. I AM REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. BUT HERE IS THE THING. THERE IS NOTHING THAT OUR NATION HAS ACHIEVED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT PROGRESS, BE IT SOCIAL JUSTICE, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR FIGHT FOR EQUALITY, THERE IS NOTHING WE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT PROGRESS THAT CAME WITHOUT A FIGHT. NOTHING. WE KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. WE LIKE A GOOD FIGHT. WE WERE BORN OUT OF A FIGHT, AND IT IS THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE THAT WE NEVER SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GIVE US PERMISSION TO TELL US WHAT IS POSSIBLE. WE MAKE IT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE AND SO WHEN OTHERS CAN'T SEE IT AND IN PARTICULAR -- WHEN OTHERS CAN SEE IT, IN PARTICULAR IOWA, YOU SEE IT AND YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN. IT IS THAT EXACT SPIRIT THAT ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE AMERICA WE CAN SEE, THE AMERICA WE CAN SEE AND BELIEVE IN WHERE EVERYONE HAS HEALTH CARE, THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE TREAT OUR CHILDREN WITH THE RESPECT AND THE NURTURING THEY DESERVE SO THEY CAN GO TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND FEEL SAFE. THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN WHERE WE RESPECT IMMIGRANTS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS. BY THE WAY, UNLESS YOU ARE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR AND CHESTER'S WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOU PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. [APPLAUSE] THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THIS IS OUR FIGHT NOW. IT'S IN AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, WHERE WE KNOW THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB WHETHER ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND ULTIMATELY FOR ME IT IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN WHICH ALSO INCLUDES THAT WHEN WE APPROACH A PERFECT STRANGER AND IN THEIR FACE WE SEE A NEIGHBOR. THAT IS THE AMERICA WE ARE FIGHTING FOR AND I BELIEVE WE WILL WIN. THANK YOU, GUYS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?466668-1/kamala-harris-meets-voters-muscatine-iowa	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 presidential candidate, spoke to and met with voters at the Missipi Brewing Company in Muscatine, Iowa.

AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, SO YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. CREATED BY CABLE IN 1979, C-SPAN IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY YOUR LOCAL CABLE OR SATELLITE PROVIDER. C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS WAS CAMPAIGNING THIS WEEKEND IN IOWA FOR THE DEMOCRATIC'S EVENTUAL NOMINATION. WE FOLLOWED HER AS WE , AS SHE SPOKE WITH VOTERS AT A HOUSE PARTY HOSTED AT THE RESIDENCE OF A COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR IN KNOXVILLE, IOWA. SHE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ON IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY. AS THE EVENT WAS ENDING, SHE TALKED WITH YOUNG VOTERS ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY AND GUN CONTROL. HELLO, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME. WE ARE HERE, SO WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU AND WELCOME TO SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. I AM THE MARION COUNTY DEMOCRATIC CHAIR. AS YOU ALL KNOW, I RAN FOR OFFICE AND THEN RAN FOR SCHOOL BOARD AND FAILED, BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP IT UP. [APPLAUSE] MS FIELDS: I KNOW ABOUT DISCRIMINATION. WHEN I WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE, WE MOVED. OUR TOWN WAS WELL-KNOWN FOR GIRLS BASKETBALL, AND IN THE NEW TOWN THERE WAS NO GIRLS BASKETBALL. WE GOT 1000 SIGNATURES AND THE SCHOOL BOARD SAID, NO GIRLS BASKETBALL. WE HAD NO GIRLS SPORTS UNTIL AFTER TITLE IX. MY YOUNGER SISTER, EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER, SHE IS IN THE WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC HALL OF FAME. I DID NOT HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I ALSO WAS A FARMER'S WIFE AND I WENT TO SIGN UP OUR FARM WITH THE USDA. USDA SAID YOU CAN'T SIGN IT UP. DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF YOUR NAME IS ON THE MORTGAGE. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE THAT YOU FARM WITH YOUR HUSBAND. YOU CANNOT SIGN UP YOUR FARM. ANOTHER DISCRIMINATION. I HAVE FOUGHT DISCRIMINATION MY WHOLE LIFE, AS A WOMAN, AS A FARMER. I THINK KAMALA HARRIS HAS ALSO HAD SOME OF THOSE EXPERIENCES. SHE WAS IN DESEGREGATION AND WAS BUSSED AND SHE FACED DISCRIMINATION. SHE HAS FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE, TOO. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. NOT FOR THE RICH, NOT FOR CALIFORNIA, IT IS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT HER MESSAGES AND THAT'S WHY I INVITED HER TO MY HOME, SO YOU COULD HEAR HER MESSAGE. SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE LOUDEST, SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST ABRASIVE , [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ANN. WHAT A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION. THIS IS WHAT YOU DO ALWAYS AND I KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU. SOME OF US LEAD IN ELECTED OFFICE AND THERE ARE LEADERS WHO ARE LEADERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO BY NATURE AND COMMITMENT. THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE, AND I AM SO THANKFUL TO YOU FOR OPENING YOUR HOME ON THIS SUNDAY THANKSGIVING WEEKEND ON A SNOWY MORNING. THANK YOU. IF WE COULD PLEASE APPLAUD , [APPLAUSE] AND THANK YOU ALL ON THIS MORNING. IT IS SUCH A WONDERFUL MORNING TO STAY HOME. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE. I AM GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF MY THOUGHTS AND SOME OF MY PLANS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS ABOUT ANYTHING. I WILL START AT THE VERY BEGINNING. THIS ELECTION PRESENTS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE AT STAKE. THEY INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE WE ARE IN A FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY, FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR RULE OF LAW, AND A FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. THINKING ABOUT THAT, AS ONE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHENEVER THERE IS A FIGHT, HOW ARE WE GOING TO WIN? I THINK TO WIN WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT THIS IS A MOMENT , WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BE LOUDER? KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN A FIGHT, THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN. THE REALITY IS THAT THE FIGHT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN DONALD TRUMP. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. THAT , IT IS OBVIOUS AND WE CAN GO ON AND I WILL TALK SOME ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE AND I THINK WE BELIEVE TO BE FAILING AND THE DAMAGE HE HAS DONE , BUT THIS IS ALSO A MOMENT THAT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT TURNING THE PAGE ON THAT, BUT A MOMENT WHERE WE MUST WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND DOING THAT ON A WAY THAT IS FOCUSED IN THE INVESTMENT OF THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. TO DO THAT AND TO WIN, I DON'T BELIEVE THE SOLUTION IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YESTERDAY CAN CURE THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW. WE HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON GOING FORWARD, ON RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL OF OUR STUDENTS, THAT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKING PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GROW THEIR FAMILIES, TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING LAID OFF, THAT WE HAVE RESOURCES INTO THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSITION TO THE JOBS THAT MUST BE FILLED. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING, BUT I BELIEVE TO WIN, WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. ANN SAID PART OF THIS. LIKE IT OR NOT, THERE HAVE BEEN POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US, AND THEY HAVE TAKEN HOLD TO SOME EXTENT. THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST THAT. THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET US TO POINT ANGERS ON EACH OTHER AND TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO FIGHT AGAINST THAT IS TO DO IT WITH A SPIRIT OF KNOWING IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR SOULS THAT THE FACT IS, WITHIN THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AND TO WIN, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS OUR NOMINEE WHO CAN STAND ON THAT STAGE AND GO TOE TO JOE WITH DONALD TRUMP , GO TOE TO TOE WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND I BELIEVE I AM THAT CANDIDATE. AS ANN SAID, THIS IS ABOUT A FIGHT, AS IT HAS BEEN MY ENTIRE CAREER, FOR THE PEOPLE. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF FIGHTERS. MY PARENTS MET WHEN THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. MY SISTER AND I JOKE WE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY ADULTS SPENT THEIR FULL-TIME MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR JUSTICE. AMONG THE HEROES OF THAT MOVEMENT WERE LAWYERS LIKE THURGOOD MARSHALL. I SAID I WANT TO DO THAT WORK, SO I DECIDED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I GRADUATED, MY MOM, WHO RAISED ME AND MY SISTER, SHE SAID, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN YOUR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE? I SAID I HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A PROSECUTOR. THE REASON IS BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT HAS OFTEN DONE JUSTICE AND OFTEN DONE INJUSTICE AND NEEDS TO BE REFORMED, SO I WANT TO GO ON THE INSIDE AND DO THAT WORK. I ALSO SAID I ALSO WANT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN BE A VOICE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND VOICELESS. I STARTED MY CAREER IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA, AN OFFICE ONCE LED BY EARL WARREN. FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I WALKED INTO A COURTROOM AND ALMOST EVERY DAY THEREAFTER, I SPOKE FIVE WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT PHRASE FOR THE PEOPLE I THINK REALLY CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. ONE, WE HAVE RIGHTLY SAID THAT A HARM AGAINST ANY ONE OF US IS A HARM AGAINST ALL OF US. THEREFORE, NO ONE SHOULD BE MADE TO FIGHT ALONE. SECOND, FOR THE PEOPLE, TO ANN'S POINT, MEANS ALL THE PEOPLE, REGARDLESS OF GENDER, RACE, WHERE THEY LIVE, THE PARTY WITH WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED, THE LANGUAGE OR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS. ALL THE PEOPLE. IT HAS BEEN IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE THAT FOR YEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF MY CAREER, I PROSECUTED CRIMES INVOLVING CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SAYING THAT THEY DESERVE A VOICE THAT GIVES THEM STRENGTH AND DIGNITY AND JUSTICE WITHOUT JUDGMENT. FOR THE PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS ELECTED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN FRANCISCO MEANT SAYING IT WAS A FAILED WAR ON DRUGS THAT LED TO AMERICA'S PROBLEM OF MASS INCARCERATION, SO I CREATED ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON GIVING JOBS TO PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR DRUGS. FOR THE PEOPLE, WHEN I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, WHERE I SERVE TWO TERMS, RUNNING THE SECOND LARGEST DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN UNITED STATES, SECOND ONLY TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, MEANT TAKING ON THE BIGGEST BANKS OF AMERICA WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES, WHICH RESULTED IN SO MANY HOMEOWNERS LOSING THEIR HOMES FROM FORECLOSURE. IT MEANT TAKING ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BIG OIL COMPANIES, AND WINNING. FOR THE PEOPLE, SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE ALMOST THREE YEARS, HAS MEANT TAKING ON JEFF SESSIONS, WILLIAM BARR, AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. AND FOR THE PEOPLE, THEN, I STAND BEFORE YOU FULLY PREPARED TO DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP. SO THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. AND I DO BELIEVE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN IN AMERICA, IN ANY PLACE YOU CAN IMAGINE, THERE IS A DAD TONIGHT WILL BE SITTING AT HIS KITCHEN COUNTER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW HE IS GOING TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE IS WORKING TWO JOBS, HE IS PAYING MORE TAXES THAN THE 400 RICHEST FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY THAT FOR TOO LONG, THE RULES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT HAVE-NOTS WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE SO THAT FOR FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN $100,000 A YEAR, THEY WILL RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO $6,000 A YEAR THEY CAN TAKE HOME UP TO $500 A MONTH. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT? ON DAY ONE, WE ARE GOING TO REPEAL THE TAX BILL THAT BENEFITS THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] FOR THE PEOPLE MEANS THINKING ABOUT THE MOM WHO HAS A CHILD WHO HAS A FEVER THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. SHE CALLS 911 AND THEY SAY, TAKE THE CHILD TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SHE IS PAUSING, LOOKING AT THOSE SLIDING GLASS DOORS, BECAUSE SHE KNOWS EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH, SHE IS GOING TO BE OUT OF IT A $1000 TO $4000 DEDUCTIBLE. HEALTH INSURANCE IS ON THE BALLOT. I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE, ESPECIALLY IN THIS YEAR OF OUR LORD 2019, A NO-BRAINER THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE GOT IN THEIR BACK POCKET. [APPLAUSE] SO I HAVE GOT A MEDICARE FOR ALL PLAN, BUT MY PLAN IS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF MY FRIENDS ON THE DEBATE STAGE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLKS WHO HAVE A PLAN THAT, BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, WILL NOT COVER ABOUT 10 MILLION PEOPLE. MY PLAN WILL COVER EVERYONE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND I AM GOING TO COVER VISION AND DENTAL AND HEARING AIDS. [APPLAUSE] ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY PLAN AND SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT GOING TO COVER THE 10 MILLION PEOPLE IS JUST THAT, MINE WILL COVER EVERYBODY. 10 MILLION PEOPLE, TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT, IS ABOUT 10 TIMES THE SIZE OF DELAWARE. ABOUT 100 TIMES THE SIZE OF SOUTH BEND, SO THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] ON THE OTHER HAND, MY PLAN IS DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS TRYING TO GET RID OF DAVID INSURANCE, BECAUSE , GET RID OF PRIVATE INSURANCE, BECAUSE I AM NOT TRYING TO DO THAT. WHEN I WAS TRAVELING, TOO MANY PEOPLE SAID, I WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE, BUT DON'T TAKE AWAY MY CHOICE BETWEEN HAVING A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PLAN. YOU WILL HAVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LAND, BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. WE ARE GOING TO BRING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN AND HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR JACKING UP PRICES FOR SO MANY YEARS. UNDER MY PLAN, THEY CANNOT CHARGE CO-PAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES AND HAVE TO PLAY BY OUR GOALS, OR THEY DON'T PLAY AT ALL. IN AMERICA, WE HAVE TEACHERS, AND HERE IN IOWA, WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO GET THROUGH THE END OF THE MONTH. 94% OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET TO PAY FOR SUPPLIES. TEACHERS ON AVERAGE ARE MAKING 11% LESS THAN SIMILARLY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS. THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE RAISING OUR CHILDREN. PARENTS, OFTEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GRANDPARENTS, AUNTIES, AND UNCLES, AND OUR TEACHERS. WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM THEIR VALUE. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A FEDERAL INVESTING IN CLOSING THE TEACHER PAY GAP, WHICH HERE IN IOWA IS $12,200. THAT'S A YEAR'S WORTH OF MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. OR A YEAR'S WORTH OF GROSERY BILLS. OR PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS OUR STUDENTS DON'T COME OUT AND JOIN A PROFESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A PAFPLGS I'M HERE ALSO TO SAY TO BETSY DEVOS , IN CASE SHE'S LISTENING, TEACHERS DON'T NEED A GUN, THEY NEED A RAISE. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] AND SPEAKING OF OUR CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU. I GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY WERE CONSIDERED THE CHILDREN OF THE COMMUNITY. SO I SAY, WHEN IN AMERICA OUR BABIES, ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TO ENDURE A DRILL DURING WHICH THEY'RE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW TO HIDE IN A CLOSET IN THE EVENT THERE'S A MASS SHOOTER ROAMING THE HALLWAYS OF THEIR SCHOOL, JUSTICE FOR OUR CHILDREN SON THE BALLOT. , IS ON THE BALLOT. SO I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY, LOOK, LEADERS HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO LEAD ON THIS. IT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SAY YOU'RE EITHER IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU WANT TO TAKE EVERYONE'S GUNS AWAY. I'M IN FAVOR OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT I ALSO KNOW, HAVING LOOKED AT MORE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS THAN I CARE TO TELL YOU, HAVING EMBRACED MORE MOTHERS OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS THAN I CARE TO TELL YOU, THAT WE NEED REASONABLE GUN SAFETY LAWS IN OUR COUNTRY. INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID, WELL, SOME PEOPLE ON THE DEBATE STAGE DISAGREE, THEY SAY KAMLA HARRIS SAYS IF THERE'S NO ACTION BY CONGRESS, SHE'LL TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION. I DID, AND I AM. THEY SAY THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES IN OFFICE, A REPUBLICAN COMES IN OFFICE LATER AND CHANGES IT? WELL YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL DEAL WITH THAT IN EIGHT YEARS. WE NEED ACTION. [APPLAUSE] WE NEED ACTION. WHEN IN AMERICA WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE SILENTLY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION, FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE, FROM SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION AND AGREE THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS ON THE BALLOT AND WE MUST ACT. AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SAY, HAG DONE THIS WORK FOR A VERY LONG TIME, NO ONE IN OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE MADE TO SILENTLY SUFFER AND WE NEED TO BRING THIS ISSUE OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND GIVE PEOPLE THE RESOURCES THEY DESERVE, UNDERSTANDING THAT HEALTH CARE DOESN'T MEAN JUST FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND WE HAVE GOT TO TREAT WHAT IS PAINING AND CAUSING PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY TO SILENTLY SUFFER NEEDLESSLY. [APPLAUSE] AND I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT I DO BELIEVE JUSTICE SON THE BALLOT. AND JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT WHEN WE HAVE A CRIMINAL LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. [APPLAUSE] AND I'M REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. IN AMERICA, IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO, I'LL TELL YOU THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT ON ALL OF THESE AND SO MANY MORE ISSUES, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. WHEN WE ADDRESS AND OVERCOME THESE VARIOUS INJUSTICES, I DO BELIEVE IT IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNLOCK THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. AND THAT'S THE AMERICA I SEE. THAT'S THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN. THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING. I DO BELIEVE, AND I KNOW, AND THIS IS TRUE, IN PARTICULAR FOR THE PEOPLE OF IOWA, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE WHAT HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE. AND TO FIGHT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT SPENDING TIME IN IOWA IS THAT IOWANS KNOW YOU NEVER SHOULD SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY'S PERMISSION TO TELL YOU WHAT'S POSSIBLE. YOU GOT TO SEE IT AND THEN YOU GOT TO JUST GO FOR IT. RIGHT? NOT WAITING TO TELL AND WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TELL YOU, OH, WE'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE DONE. NO, WE FIGHT FOR THOSE THINGS KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND GOING THERE. AND THAT, I THINK, IS WHAT IS REQUIRED OF US RIGHT NOW. IN FIGHTING FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE, BUT THERE ALSO IS SO MUCH TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE. AND WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING AND BEING. AND THAT IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO RUN. AND I DO BELIEVE IT WILL BE THAT SPIRIT AND APPROACH THAT BRINGS US TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY WINNING THIS CAMPAIGN SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU. [APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS SHERRY, I'M THE VITES CHAIR. THERE'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER AND THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT I HAVE , I HAVE LIKE A THREE-POINT QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM? WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE MIDDLE TERM, AND WHAT WOULD YOU D IN THE LONG-TERM, TO BOTH SOLVE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM, MIDDLE TERM PROBLEM AND THE LONG-TERM PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION? JUSTICE FOR IMMIGRANTS IS ON THE BALLOT. AND WHEN WE HAVE HAD POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABOUT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES, AND SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS IN THE NAME OF BORDER SECURITY WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BEING COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, WE KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND YOU KNOW, LISTEN, LET'S ALSO AGREE, IMMIGRANTS HAVE HELPED MAKE AMERICA. WHAT IT IS. YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST TALK TURKEY HERE. [LAUGHTER] UNLESS YOU'RE NATIVE AMERICAN OR YOUR ANCESTORS WERE KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT OVER ON A SLAVE SHIP, YOUR PEOPLE ARE IMMIGRANTS. SO , AND BY THE WAY. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO REMIND DONALD TRUMP SOME OF HIS CLOSEST RELATIVES ARE IMMIGRANTS TOO. [APPLAUSE] EXACTLY. SO ON THIS ISSUE, I START WITH A STATEMENT OF WHAT SHOULD BE OUR VALUES ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. AND THAT THE HORRIBLE DISSERVICE OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE HAS CAUSED WHOLE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE TO LIVE IN FEAR. OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT DID NOT WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AFTER HE WAS ELECTED FOR FEAR THAT WHEN THEY CAME HOME AFTER SCHOOL THEIR PARENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. THE NUMBER OF PEDIATRICIANS WHO REPORTED THERE WERE CANCELED OPPONENT , APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT INTERACTION WITH THE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS. ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS ON THIS WAS THE LATE, GREAT, JOHN MCCAIN. LINDSEY GRAHAM. HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS AS IT TURNS OUT. RIGHT? SO PART OF IT IS WE NEED A NEW PRESIDENT WHO WILL MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SHE IS PREPARED TO SIGN LEGISLATION THAT WILL IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP IN THE , SIT CERTAINSHIP. IN THE SHORT-TERM, WE NEED TO REINSTATE DACA PROTECTIONS FOR THE DREAMER. STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT. WE SAID TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM CAME TO THE COUNTRY BEFORE THEY COULD WALK OR TALK, IF YOU GIVE US INFORMATION ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR ARRIVAL IF YOU PROVE TO US YOU ARE LIVING A PRODUCTIVE LIFE, NOT COMMITTING ANY CRIMES, THEN WE WILL DEFER DEPORTATION, WE WON'T BETORT YOU. THAT'S WHAT DACA WAS. AND WE SAID IF YOU GIVE US THIS INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF, WE WILL NOT SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH I.C.E. THIS PRESIDENT CAME IN AND BROKE AMERICA'S PROMISE TO THESE KIDS. WHO ARE LIVING IN FEAR RIGHT NOW. AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING THEM FROM BEING DEPORTED IS THAT THERE WAS A COURT ORDER SAYING YOU CAN'T. SO I WOULD REINSTATE DACA IMMEDIATELY. AND THEN MID AND LONG-TERM IT'S ABOUT PASSING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WITH A PATHWAY TOWARD CITIZENSHIP. ALSO SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE IF A WAY WE RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY AMERICA'S HISTORY BUT THAT THERE WILL BE GREAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR WHAT WE DO WHEN WE PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. THERE LIL WLS , THERE WILL ALSO BE, WE'LL BE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO AND WHAT WE ARE IN TERMS OF OUR VALUES, THAT INCLUDE NOT PUTTING BABIES IN CAGES. ON DAY ONE, I'LL SHUT DOWN THOSE PRIVATE DETENTION CENTERS. AFTER THE FIRST DEBATE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, IT WAS IN MIAMI, SINCE I WAS IN FLORIDA ANYWAY, I DROVE DOWN TO A PLACE CALLED HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA. IN HOMESTEAD, FLORIDA, THERE'S A PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITY THAT YOUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE PAYING FOR. A PRIVATE DETENTION FACILE TAI TY THAT AT LEAST THEN DID HOUSE 2,700 CHILDREN. AND LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITY, EBUSINESS MODEL, IS THAT CERTAIN HUMAN BEINGS ARE MAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY OFF OF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS CALLED CHILDREN. AND OTHER, RIGHT. SO IMMEDIATELY, GOING TO SHUT THOSE DOWN. AND , THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. BUT WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] YOU TALKED ABOUT JUSTICE BEING ON THE BALLOT, I AGREE WITH THAT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO SO MANY PEOPLE AREN'T INCARCERATED THAT REALLY DON'T BELONG THERE? A NUMBER OF THINGS. I KNOW THIS SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE. IT'S PART OF WHY I WAME A PROSECUTOR. WE ENDED UP INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR WHAT WAS A HEALTH ISSUE. DRUG ADDICTION IS A HEALTH ISSUE, AND IT NEEDS TO BE TREATED AS SUCH. IT'S A DISEASE THAT NEEDS TO BE TREATED, NOT IN JAILS AND PRISON BUS THROUGH A PUBLIC HELL SYSTEM. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. I'M A PROPONENT OF LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. AND BY THE WAY, ALSO A PROPONENT OF SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE ARRESTED AND ARE NOW FELONS FOR LIFE AND NOW ARE LOOKING AT MANY STATES INCLUDING MY HOME STATE THAT'S LEGALIZED MARIJUANA AND IT'S NOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASH COW INDUSTRIES IN AMERICA, THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND NOW THEY'RE FELONS FOR LIFE AND CAN'T GET JOBS, LET'S EXPUNGE THEIR RECORDS AND PUT THEM FIRST IN LINE TO GET THE JOBS IN THIS NEW INDUSTRY. BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? THE ONLY DIFFERENCE , ACTUALLY THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING NOW, MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY? WHAT ARE THEY DOING? SELLING WEED. BEFORE THIS, WHAT WERE THOSE FOLKS DOING? SELLING WEED. IF YOU LOOK AT, WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB, EXPERIENCE NEEDED, THEY'VE GOT EXPERIENCE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? WE ALSO HAVE TO, ONE OF MY BIG AREAS OF FOCUS IS ALSO INCARCERATED WOMEN. WE HAVE STATES IN AMERICA THAT ARE SHACKLING WOMEN DURING CHILDBIRTH. PROFIT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, OUTRAGEOUS. SO IF YOU'VE EVER VISITED ANYONE WHO IS INCARCERATED, YOU'LL KNOW, IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO TALK TO THEM ON THE PHONE, THEY'RE CHARGED LIKE $1 A MINUTE FOR A PHONE CALL. VIDEO CONFERENCING IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT, I'LL USE AS AN EXAMPLE, INCARCERATED WOMEN. MOST OF THEM ARE MOMS. MOST ARE NOT IN FOR LIFE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM LOVE THEIR CHILDREN. AND EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM IS SET UP WORKS AGAINST THEM BONDING WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND EVENTUALLY REUNIFYING WITH THEIR CHILDREN. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE PLACE WOMEN SO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY, AND MEN, MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL TO WHERE THEIR INCARCERATED RELATIVE MAY BE. WE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. NOT TO MENTION THE MONEY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AROUND BAIL. I'VE BEEN A LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYING WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING IN JAIL FOR DAY, WEEKS, MONTHS, EVEN YEAR, WAITING TO GO TO TRIAL, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE MONEY TO PAY BAIL. MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MONEY ARE OUT. THAT IS ON ITS FACE UNFAIR. THAT'S NOT ONLY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE, THAT'S AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. I'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET RID OF THE MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT, AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, DE, FOR-PROFIT DETENTION FACILITIES, THAT INCLUDES FOR-PROFIT PRISONS. WE NEED TO SHUT THOSE DOWN. THE MOTIVATION THERE IS NOT TO RUN PROGRAMS HELPING PEOPLE GET OUT EARLY, HELPING THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. YOU'RE MAKING MONEY BY HAVING PEOPLE IN YOUR JAIL. THOSE ARE SOME WAYS WE NEED TO REFORM THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE QUESTION BUT POINTS IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES. I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND THAT I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS THORRY SO I HOPE THIS NEWS REPORT WAS ACCURATE. OVER THE WEEKEND I READ THAT IN ADDITION TO THE WALL THAT MR. TRUMP IS TRYING TO BUILD WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS, THERE'S A PRIVATE CORPORATION BUILDING A SEPARATE WALL IN A FLOODPLAIN THAT OUR LAW WILL NOT PERMIT BUT SOMEHOW THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SYSTEM. SO THE QUESTION IS TWO-FOLD. WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ENSURE A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE IN AMERICA, AND HOW WILL YOU DEAL WITH THIS, WHAT I SUSPECT IS MAYBE AN ILLEGAL EFFORT BY A PRIVATE CORPORATION TO SUPPORT TRUMP'S EFFORT TO BUILD A WALL? LET'S START WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT ADMINISTRATIONS WE'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE CORRUPT. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THAT CABINET, IT'S A CABINET OF SPECIAL INTERESTS. FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYONE THERE NEVER WAS DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SERVICE. I'VE ONLY HAD ONE CLIENT MY ENTIRE CAREER AND THAT'S BEEN THE PEOPLE. I HAVE NEVER WORKED FOR A CORPORATION, I'VE NEVER WORKED FOR A SPECIAL INTEREST. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CABINET AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE TO DO WORK IN THE PUBLIC TRUST FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD, AND THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT ARE CLEARLY THERE FOR NOT PUBLIC SERVICE BUT SELF-SERVICE. MANY OF WHOM CAME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND AFTER THIS QUICK STINT ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH THEY HAVE HELPED PROFIT EVEN MORE BY DEREGULATING ENTIRE INDUSTRIES WHILE THEY'VE BEEN SUPPOSEDLY LEADERS IN OUR GOVERNMENT. AND SO, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERN, I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF WHAT YOU SHARED BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS JUST ACROSS THE BORDER, I KNOW IT TO BE A SERIOUS CONCERN WHICH IS HOW MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING THIS PRESIDENT HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY PROFIT VERSUS WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE BETSY DEVOS. SHE'S BECOME A KIND OF GOOD LAUGH LINE BUT LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT. THIS HER WHOLE FAMILY, THEIR WHOLE BUSINESS MODEL IS ABOUT TRYING TO PRIVATIZE EDUCATION. YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN SELLING OFF PUBLIC LANDS. THIS ADMINISTRATION. FOR DRILLING. YOU CAN JUST GO DOWN THE LIST AND SO YOUR CONCERN IS A LEGITIMATE ONE. ON THAT WALL, LOOK, THAT WALL IS NEVER GETTING BUILT AND MEXICO IS CERTAINLY NOT PAYING FOR IT. RIGHT? [APPLAUSE] AND YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF BUSH DUH I DON'T DOUBT THERE WOULD BE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE BENEFITING, I KNOW THAT THERE WERE REPORTS ABOUT, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PREVIOUS CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH SOME OF THE PRIVATE AND FOR-PROFIT PRISONS, YOU KNOW. SO I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. AND YOU KNOW, DOESN'T , IT DOESN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE NEWS BUT THIS ISSUE OF THE PUBLIC TRUST IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOWING, YOU AND I KNOW, YOU HOLD THESE POSITIONS NOT FOR YOUR PERSONAL POWER. HUH HOLD THESE POSITIONS TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. THERE'S A VERY SACRED TRUST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE JOBS. OR SHOULD BE. THAN ADMINISTRATION ACROSS THE BOARD HAS VIOLATED THAT TRUST. ACROSS THE BOARD. WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE BUMS OUT. [LAUGHTER] YES, THANK YOU FOR BEING BACK IN MARION COUNTY, YOU WERE HERE IN AUGUST. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP FARMS LIKE OURS AND MARION COUNTY FARMERS, IOWA FARMERS, AMERICAN FARMERS, LEAD ON CLIMATE ACTION? [APPLAUSE] KAMALA. THAT'S SUCH A , I ACTUALLY JUST DID AN INTERVIEW EARLIER ABOUT THIS. FIRST OF ALL, I ENJOYED OUR LAST VISIT. IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF MY CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. FARMERS ARE EXPLICITLY IN MY PLAN. AS I WAS SAYING DURING THIS INTERVIEW THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT FARM, BY THE WAY, BACKGROUND. MY STATE, CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE A HUGE AGRICULTURAL , YOU MIGHT THINK OH, CALIFORNIA WHAT IS THAT, IT'S HOLLYWOOD. I HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH FARMERS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT FARMERS IS THAT BY YOUR VERY NATURE, YOU ARE SO INNOVATIVE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXEY OF SITTING BACK AND OH, THIS IS WHATEVER. HAVING OPINIONS. YOU'VE GOT TO GET STUFF DONE AND YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT. YOU'VE GOT TO ADAPT TO WHATEVER NATURE PRESENTS YOU. AND IN THAT WAY, YOU ALSO ARE SO CLOSE TO IT THAT YOU KNOW MORE THAN MOST WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TERMS OF HOW THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING. AND SO I LOOK VERY FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH FARMERS IN OUR PLAN FOR WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A COUNTRY. IN DOING A BETTER JOB OF SUSTAINING THIS PLANET. AND THAT'S ABOUT THINGS LIKE COVER CROP, WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT INVESTING IN THE LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO TO PARTNER THERE AROUND DEVELOPING INNOVATIONS. BIOFUELS. THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THERE'S SUCH GREAT PROMISE THERE. AND FRANKLY, ANYBODY WHO IS IN POSITION OF HAVING AN OPINION ON THIS, SHOULD, AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT BRINGING FARMERS IN TO BE PART OF IT, NOT ONLY FOR IMPLEMENTING BUT DESIGNING THESE ISSUES. THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF RESPECTING OUR FARMERS IN TERMS OF TRADE POLICY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN THERE AGAIN THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS. EVERYTHING FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND FARMERS IN IOWA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT BANKRUPTCY, DARELY FARMERS IN WISCONSIN. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN, TALK ABOUT A VIOLATION OF TRUST THERE TOO. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS WINTER DAY OUT IN, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY SAID I LIVE BACK IN THE 1950'S WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK. ON GRAVEL ROADS AND FARM. SO WE ARE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. YOU ARE ALL WELCOME TO STAY, WE HAVE MORE COFFEE, WE HAVE MORE PASTRIES AND TALK ABOUT IT AND TALK TO ALL THE ORGANIZERS. AND IF YOU WANT TO CAUCUS, I'M HOUR THEY'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE YOUR NAME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2019] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] OH, GREAT. KNOCKING ON DOORS IS ABOUT, IT'S WHY I SAY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS, THE ELECTION HAS TO BE ABOUT THE FUTURE. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT IF WE DON'T GET IT RIGHT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE NEXT 12 YEARS, OR MAYBE SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME. THIS IS LITERALLY ABOUT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. IT'S ABOUT CONSERVING NATURAL LAND, RIGHT? I'VE ACTUALLY DONE THE WORK. THERE ARE A LOT OF SUBJECTS WE CAN DISCUSS AND PEOPLE CAN GIVE A LOVELY PEACH ABOUT BUT I'VE DONE THE WORK. WHEN I WAS DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE DARK AGES, IN 2003 I WAS ELECTED, WHAT YEAR WERE YOU BORN? 2004. CAM LAMPLET BEFORE YOU WERE BORN! I CREATED AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE UNIT IN MY OFFICE TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND POOR COMMUNITIES, DUMPING GROUNDS FOR CHEMICALS, FOR POLLUTION. AND WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE POLLUTERS. I DEFENDED SOME OF THE TOUGHEST LAWS SAYING WE NEED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE BIG POLLUTERS NEED TO PAY A PENALTY FOR THIS. THIS IS NOT NATURALLY OCCURRING. THE HARM TO OUR ENVIRONMENT, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S NATURALLY HAPPENING. IT'S BECAUSE OF POLLUTION. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO MADE A LOT OF MONEY IN POLLUTION. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT BIG TOBACCO AND WHAT THEY DID FOR YEARS? THEY KNEW WITH THEY WERE DOING WAS HARMFUL. THEY DID THE RESEARCH. THEY DID IT ANYWAY. BECAUSE THEY WERE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY. A LOT OF THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH THE BIG OIL COMPANIES IS THEY ALSO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WE NEED TO GO AFTER THEM. THAT'S ONE BIG AREA. ONE OF MY BIG AREAS OF FOCUS IS PUBLIC EDUCATION. I WANT YOU GUYS TO HAVE A SCHOOL WHERE WHEN YOU GO ALL THAT YOU WANT TO DO IS OPEN UP YOUR MIND TO THE WONDERS OF MATH AND ART AND SCIENCE, IT'S A HUGE ISSUE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. IT'S A BIG ISSUE HERE IN IOWA. TO HAVE FREE COLLEGE, INTEREST FREE LOANS, WHAT ENDS UP HAPPEN, YOU'LL END UP TAKING OUT A LOAN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON IT YOU END UP OWING MORE THAN YOU TOOK OUT IN A LOAN. I WANT TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH, THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS, THAT'S NOT , I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR HELP. OK? THANK YOU. BUT I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. AND IT WAS EARLY. THE EARLY DIDN'T BOTHER ME IRK GOT UP EARLY. I'M NOT GOOD IN THE SNOW. SO WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS ONE HERE, I THOUGHT, OK, IT'S NOT SNOWING AND I'LL COME SEE YOU. I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. YOU HIT ALL THE SUBJECTS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH A BIG EFFORT TO BE HERE. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. IT'S SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT. NORMALLY EDUCATION WOULD BE MY NUMBER ONE TOPIC BUT HOW CAN WE NOT CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT? HOW CAN WE NOT CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY? AND WE DO KNOW HOW TO DO I. WE DO KNOW HOW TO DO IT. WE HAVE TO HEAL. THERE'S BEEN SO MANY BIG CHALLENGES AS A NATION. REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN OFFICE. WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS TO UNIFY AROUND THE COMMONALITY. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. IF WE THINK THAT WAY, WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT SO. YEAH. I'VE LIVE SOD MANY PLACES, KNOWN SO MANY CULTURES, I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING TO BE TRUE THAT WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN DIFFERENCES. I HAVE A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO COALITION BUILDING AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STILL BEST FRIENDS WITH MY BEST FRIEND FROM KINDERGARTEN. IT'S LIKE TRAVELING A WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN IN DIFFERENT CITIES, BUT STILL ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IS MY BEST FRIEND FROM KINDERGARTEN. THANK YOU FOR COME, GUYS. THANK YOU. HI! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOING TO VOLUNTEER DOWN THERE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM. IT'S ONE OF THOSE ISSUES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THE WAY TO REMEMBER , LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR. IF A PARENT IS PAYING A PERFECT STRANGER TO TRANSPORT A CHILD OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, THROUGH AN ENTIRE FOREIGN COUNTRY, WHY WOULD A PARENT DO THAT? IT IS BECAUSE IF THEY STAY WHERE THEY ARE IT'S EVEN WORSE. BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVE, THEY SAGO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM. IT'S INHUMANE. THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE. THIS IS PART OF WHAT TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. OUR STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD IN LARGE PART HAS NOT BEEN DERIVED FROM THE MILITARY BUT THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY INCLUDING INVESTING HUMANITARIAN AID IN PLACES THAT NEED IT. AND ALSO ENCOURAGING THEIR DEMOCRACY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NORTHERN TRIANGLE, WE HAVE ABANDONED THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE. THERE IS SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING THE WORK HAPPENING THERE TOO. IT'S A BIG PART OF IT. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. PUBLIC EDUCATION IS ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES. MY TEACHER ATTENDED BYMY LAW SCHOOL GRADUATION, ALMOST EVERYTHING I FEEL ABOUT PUBLIC EDUCATION HAS BEEN DUE TO MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHICH IS THAT I KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR TEACHERS. I KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HAVING A ROBUST ENVIRONMENT IN A CLASSROOM THAT INCLUDES HAVING A TEACHER, TEACHER'S AIDES, HAVING A NURSE IN THE SCHOOL, SOCIAL WORKER IN THE SCHOOL. I'M VERY CLEAR THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FAMILY THAT RAISED ME, IT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT THAT ALLOWED ME TO THEN BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. AND SO PUBLIC SESSION ONE OF MY HIGHEST AREAS OF FOCUS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT SALARIES, WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR RESOURCES IN CLASSROOM. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO BE SAFE. LET HER KNOW ALL THAT. THANK YOU. WE NEED TO , THESE THINGS ARE NONPARTISAN. SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT PARTISAN. NOT EVEN BIPARTISAN BUT NONPARTISAN. SO YOU KNOW, WE NEED LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THAT AND THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT IS ABOUT FIXING PROBLEMS. THAT'S PART OF WHY I'M RUNNING. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LONG DEBATE OR ANY DEBATE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, VIRTUES OF CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM. THEY WANT HEALTH CARE. WITHOUT WORRIES ABOUT HOW TO AFFORD I. THEY WANT TO PAY THEIR RENT. I HAVE A WHOLE INITIATIVE ABOUT AFFORDABLE RENT. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL WHERE THERE'S A NURSE AND THERE'S A SOCIAL WORKER. MY NIECE HAS CANESER, WHEN SHE WAS FIRST BEING TREATED SHE SAID I'M GETTING WONDERFUL CARE, HAVE WONDERFUL INSURANCE, DONE WORRY ABOUT ME. NOW AFTER ABOUT A YEAR SHE SAID I'M GETTING WONDERFUL CARE BUT THE BILLS HAVE STARTED COMING IN. HER INSURANCE COMPANY, THEY GAVE YOU THE WRONG DRUG, WE CAN'T PAY FOR THAT I DON'T CARE HOW THAT GETS FIXED, WHETHER IT'S YOUR PLAN OR ANY OF THE PLANS THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAGE BUT IT'S GOT TO BE FIXED. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THIS , OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF DICTATING WHAT DOCTORS CAN TREAT AND CANNOT TREAT. THEY CANNOT , EVERY SHOULD HAVE OPTIONS. THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT PROVIDING FULL COVERAGE FOR SOMEONE WHO IS A CANCER PATIENT. HOW OLD IS SHE? NO PROPERTY PROVIDING COVERAGE THEY SHOULD GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING FULL COVERAGE FOR SOMEONE GOING THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT. WE THINK SHE'S GOING TO RECOVER, WE'RE HOPEFUL BUT WE'RE CONCERNED AND WE WATCH HER FIGHTING FOR HER HEALTH, NOT FOR HER ECONOMIC , WE WANT HER FIGHTING FOR HER HEALTH NOT HER ECONOMIC SURVIVE. , SURVIVAL.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?466837-1/senator-kamala-harris-house-party-knoxville-iowa	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), a 2020 presidential candidate, spoke with voters at a house party hosted at the residence of a county Democratic Party chair in Knoxville, Iowa.

CSPANKH93202014	Kamala Harris	2020-03-09	Joe Biden Campaign Event in Detroit	Guest: IS VERY MUCH IN THE MIX. THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF SEATS WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL SHOT OF TAKING THE ROUTE HOUSE AND THE ROLLING AND SENATORS, SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE IS FACING THE RACE OF HER LIFE FOR HER APPROVAL RATINGS HAVE GONE FROM 78-42 SINCE TRUMP SHOWED UP ON THE SCENE IN 2015 AND THAT'S A STARK DECLINE. MARTHA MAKE SALLY IN ARIZONA LOST HER LAST RACE AND SHE'S ON THE BALLOT AGAIN. WE BREAK AWAY FROM THIS BACK TO DETROIT, MICHIGAN WHERE JOE BIDEN, GET OUT THE VOTE RALLY, IS ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY. HEADING TO THE STAGE RIGHT NOW, GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN, GRETCHEN WHICH WERE , GRETCHEN WITMER. THANK YOU. I WILL TRY NOT TO START DANCING BUT I'M HAPPY, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DETROIT, I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH YOU BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU I FELT BETTER IN THE LAST TEN DAYS THAN I HAVE IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS. DO YOU FEEL ME? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHY, I DECIDED TO JUMP ON ENDORSED JOE BIDEN. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE JOE KNOWS MICHIGAN. JOE CARES ABOUT MICHIGAN AND CARES ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MICHIGAN ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW HEALTHCARE IS PERSONAL. RIGHT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AS A 29 -YEAR-OLD I BECAME A MEMBER IS KNOWN AS THE SANDWICH GENERATION BIT I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO GENERATIONS OF MY OWN FAMILY FROM WHOM I WAS THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER. MY MOM WAS DYING OF BRAIN CANCER, MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS A NEWBORN. THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME UNIQUE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THAT. I WAS ALSO FIGHTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS WRONGFULLY DENYING MY MOMS CHEMOTHERAPY. I HAVE COMMISERATED WITH JOE BIDEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE BRAIN TUMOR THAT KILLED MY MOTHER IS THE SAME ONE THAT TOOK BEAU BIDEN'S LIFE. I KNOW THAT HE AND BARACK OBAMA EXPANDED HEALTHCARE IN THIS COUNTRY ALMOST 700,000 MICHIGANDERS GOT HEALTHCARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF THAT IS NOT PERSONAL ENOUGH TO MANY OF US HERE IN MICHIGAN, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS. WHEN WE WERE ON THE ROPES, WHEN OUR AUTO INDUSTRY WAS STRUGGLING, WHO HAD OUR BACK? THAT'S RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN PAID THEY CAME TO THE RESCUE WHEN PEOPLE COUNTED AND WHAT PEOPLE SAID LET IT FAIL FAIL, THEY SAID NO, WE ARE IN BECAUSE MICHIGAN IS IMPORTANT. THEY HAD OUR BACKS AND TODAY I SAY LET'S HAVE JOE BIDEN'S BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN A POLITICAL DISCOURSE WHERE IT IS SO NASTY AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FRACTURE US AND DIVIDE US, BURN BRIDGES, BUILD WALLS, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL BUILD BRIDGES AND THAT IS WHO JOE BIDEN IS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT WE WON IN 2018 BY BIG NUMBERS BECAUSE WHY? WE SHOWED UP WE STAYED FOCUS ON THE DINNER TABLE ISSUES. WE SHOWED A RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE AND WE BUILT A COALITION. AS A DEMOCRAT I CAN SAY THIS, I AM PROUD OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THEIR NAMES ON THIS BALLOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE IS A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IN EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHETHER IT WAS PETE BUTTIGIEG OR ELIZABETH WARREN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OR AMY KLOBUCHAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHETHER IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW, COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE I'M THINKING ABOUT. [LAUGHTER] HOLD ON, I'M GETTING THERE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN THOUGH IS HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A COALITION. I'M RIDING WITH BIDEN AND EVERYONE HAS A SEAT TOO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT IT TAKES COALITIONS TO WIN AND THIS CAMPAIGN LOOKS LIKE THIS COUNTRY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO INTRODUCE, EXHIBIT A, MY GOOD FRIEND WHO IS HERE TO JOIN US ALL AND TELL US WHY HE DECIDED TO JUMP IN, MY FRIEND THE PHENOMENAL SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (music)(music) [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT, HELLO EVERYBODY! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT DETROIT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON, EVERYBODY, BECAUSE THIS MORNING I MADE IT OFFICIAL, I AM HEREBY ENDORSING JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON JOE'S TEAM BECAUSE JOE IS ON YOUR TEAM TEAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO BE WITH JOE BECAUSE JOE IS WITH ALL OF US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN I GET HERE TO DETROIT I FEEL LIKE I GOT DETROIT CRIED BECAUSE MY MOM WAS BORN RIGHT HERE IN THIS CITY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MY GRANDFATHER, MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN IN THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND WAS A UAW UNION WORKER AND I'M PROUD OF THAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ... ... THIS IS THE PARTY OF CIVIL RIGHTS, OF VOTING RIGHTS, OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, OF WORKERS RIGHTS AND UNION AND SUPPORTING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THE PARTY THAT BELIEVES THIS RADICAL CONCEPT , I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF IT , IS CALLED SCIENCE BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED FOUR YEARS AGO. WE'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH NOW. OUR NATION WHICH EVERY GENERATION WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MORE PERFECT UNION ELECTED PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO RIP US APART. YOU LOOK AT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HE DOESN'T TRY TO LIFT THEM UP, HE TRIES TO PARE THEM DOWN. IT SEEMS HE TAKES PLEASURE IN PUTTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS. WE GOT KNOCKED BACK AND KNOCKED DOWN FOUR YEARS AGO LIKE THIS HIGH SCHOOL WHO WAS VERY MASCOT IS THE PHOENIX [CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR US AS A NATION TO RUN UP. WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, WE DON'T SHUT UP OR GIVE UP, WE STAND UP AND WE RISE UP. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS ONE MAN NOW READY TO GO TO THE ARENA WHO IS OUR BEST SHOT TO BE DONALD TRUMP HE IS THE BEST ONE TO HEAL THE SOUL OF AMERICA. HE IS THE BEST ONE TO STAND UP FOR ALL OF US IN AMERICA AND THAT PERSON'S NAME IS JOE BIDEN. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME SOME HELP, BECAUSE HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. [APPLAUSE] HELP ME NOW. HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE CAN'T PRAY THAT HE WINS OR HOPE THAT HE WINS AND WE CANNOT WISH THAT HE WINS. WE'VE GOT TO VOTE HIM IN. SO THIS IS ON ALL OF YOU. WE KNOW WHAT THE ANCESTORS SAID WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, THERE IS NO PROGRESS. WE KNOW WE'VE GOT TO TURN OUR ANGER INTO ACTION. THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO PROVIDE WHICH WAY DO WE GO DO WE GO TO THE LOW ROAD WHERE WE SEE THATTHE BETTER DAYS OF AMERICA DISAPPEAR UNDER THE SUN OR DO WE GO THE HIGHER ROAD AND PROCLAIM THAT WE ARE A NATION WHERE LIBERTY STILL REIGNS IN AND WHERE EVERY AMERICAN HAS HEALTH CARE AND WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ENDS THE NIGHTMARE. BRIAN STEVENSON SAID WHERE PEOPLE WORK HARD. YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY UNLESS YOU LOVE YOUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN. I WANT TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW ARE YOU READY TO WORK FOR JOE BIDEN BUT TOMORROW IT STARTS. I GO TO THE SENATE AND FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME MOMENTUM I SOMETIMES HAVE TO CALL IN TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE I KNOW JOE IS ABOUT TO COME ONTO THE STAGE BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON THAT IS A RISING STAR IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] LIGHTNING BRINGING THE LIGHT, ONE OF OUR POWERFUL PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE JOE BIDEN WINS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND SO ONE MORE VOICE, A VOICE OF CHANGE AND HOPE AND TOMORROW. A VOICE OF TODAY I BRING TO THE STAGE A GREAT SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING] (music)(music) WHAT'S UP, DETROIT! IT IS GOOD TO BE BACK. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING] WE ARE CELEBRATING THE WORK WE ARE ABOUT TO DO FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO, EVERYBODY. MICHIGAN, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. I DO BELIEVE THAT. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THIS GREAT STATE, IT IS THE MEASURE OF HOW AMERICA IS DOING AND WHAT AMERICA IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE KIND OF FIGHT AND WORK THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS PUT INTO INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF AMERICA, WE WILL ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE JOE IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE POWERFUL FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SELL HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. THEY ARE VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DIVIDE US AND HELP US TURN AGAINST EACH OTHER AND HERE'S MY THEORY ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DISILLUSION US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THE SYSTEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT EVER WORK FOR US, TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE CANNOT TRUST OUR DEMOCRACY TRYING TO HAVE US BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T MATTER, POWERFUL FORCES THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SAY TO YOU YOU DON'T MATTER, SO DON'T PARTICIPATE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PICK A DIFFERENCE. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY TO US DO NOT TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT. THEY TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT THEY ARE A LOAN. LET'S SEE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT POWERTHEPOWER IS WITH THE PEOPLE. WHAT WE KNOW IS WE WILL NOT BE OVERLOOKED, AND WE WILL NOT BE CANCELED. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT SAYING WE KNOW WHAT MATTERS AND WE KNOW THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT ACHIEVED THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY AND YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT WE KNOW IF WE STOP FIGHTING WE WILL NEVER GET THERE AND SO WE FIGHT. THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AS A NATION HAS BEEN ABOUT FIGHTING FOR OUR IDEAS. [CHEERING] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOE WE KNOW. I'M PROUD TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I BELIEVE IN JOE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO REFLECTIVE OF HIS PERSONALITY IS WHEN HE SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE, BUT THAT IS WHO HE IS. THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE IS. HE'S AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS LIVED A LIFE OF INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OTHERS. SHE HAD MADE GREAT PERSONAL SACRIFICES IN HIS LIFE. HE IS EXPERIENCED IN LIFE GREAT PAIN AND GLORY. HE UNDERSTANDS WHO PEOPLE ARE. I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. DONALD TRUMP, HE DOESN'T GET IT. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET IT. HE DOESN'T SEE PEOPLE. THE ONLY PEOPLE HE SEES ARE THE PEOPLE HE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND SEES. HE DOESN'T SEE THE PEOPLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO FEELS, WHO UNDERSTANDS, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH WHEN HE'S WORKING TWO JOBS AND HE KNOWS HE'S MISSING HIS SON'S BALLGAME. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING AT THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND KNOWING EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS INSURANCE, IF SHE WALKS THROUGH WITH HER SICK CHILD IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF POCKET MULTIPLE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR HER DEDUCTIBLE. NEED A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS THE COURAGE AND THE POWER TO SEE AND FEEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND BEEN LEFT UP TO PEOPLE. THAT IS JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I GOT TO KNOW JOE BEST THROUGH HIS SON. HOW THE BIG BANG HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN PREDATORY LENDING ACTIVITIES, SO MANY PEOPLE HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND JOE BIDEN STOOD WITH ME EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF STATE OF DELAWARE HAVEN'T BEEN HIT AS HARD AS SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. I GOT TO KNOW JOE THROUGHBO. IT'S RARE TO SEE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS SON. IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP THEY HAD. AND HE SHOWED COURAGE ALL THE TIME AND CONVICTION. HE SPOKE WITH SO MUCH LOVE ABOUT THE FATHER RAISED HIM INTO THE MAN HE WAS. I KNOW JOE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING HIM AND MY FINAL POINT IS MICHIGAN, JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. [APPLAUSE] ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. HEALTHCARE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. RACIAL JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. AND JOE BIDEN IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WITH THAT I INTRODUCE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] HELLO, DETROIT. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO ME, BUT TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE NATIONAL COCHAIRS TO SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE OVER MICHIGAN AND BEYOND MICHIGAN SO, GOVERNOR WHEN I HEAR THAT GREAT LINE JUST FIX THE ROADS, LET'S FIX THE COUNTRY. BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT AND JUST OVER A WEEK AGO THE PRESS INDEPENDENCE DECLARED THIS CAMPAIGN DEAD. SOUTH CAROLINA SPOKE. THEN THE SUPER TUESDAY SPOKE. THE TURNOUT WAS INCREDIBLE AND NOW TOMORROW, MICHIGAN, MISSISSIPPI, MISSOURI, NORTH DAKOTA, IDAHO, WASHINGTON STATE AND MICHIGAN, I'M COUNTING ON YOU IN A BIG WAY. SENATOR SANDERS LIKES TO SAY WE ARE ONLY GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP BY GENERATING EXCITEMENT AND TURNOUT. ON SUPER TUESDAY WE TURNOUT MORE VOTERS. THEY VOTE FOR US NORTH CAROLINA 19%, TEXAS, 40% MORE VOTERS. I CAN GO ON. BUT FOLKS, HE'S RIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT A DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT IS THIS MOVEMENT WE STARTED IS GENERATING IN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT AROUND THE COUNTRY. FOLKS, WE CAN'T CREATE A MOVEMENT WITHOUT THE BASIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. [INAUDIBLE] I DIDN'T , ARE YOU WITH DONALD TRUMP? CHANTING] THAT'S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM GO. IT'S NOT A TRUMP RALLY. LET HIM GO. FOLKS, LET HIM GO, THAT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. LET HIM GO. THIS IS NOT A TRUMP RALLY. FOLKS , [CHANTING] [CHANTING] /THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN POLITICIANS. LET THEM GO. [CHANTING] I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. IT'S A REFLECTION OF WHAT IS WRONG IN AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. [CHANTING] THERE IS ONE OTHER THING DONALD TRUMP TELLS GENERATED. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY OR AS A PEOPLE. WE HAD A LOT OF CRAZY FOLKS AROUND. I'M SORRY, FOLKS. EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN KNOCKED DOWN, COUNTED, LEFT BEHIND, THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. WE NEED YOU. WE WANT YOU TO BE PART OF OUR CAMPAIGN SO JOIN US. JOIN JOE BIDEN.COM AND SIGN UP. FOLKS, IF YOU WANT A NOMINEE WHO WILL NOT ONLY BEAT DONALD TRUMP BUT KEEP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , FOLKS YOU WANT A NOMINEE THAT IS GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN BACK THE UNITED STATES SENATE, JOIN US. [APPLAUSE] A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT, PROUD DEMOCRAT, OBAMA BIDEN DEMOCRAT, JOIN US TO BRING IT TOGETHER AND NOT TEAR IT APART. WE ARE BUILDING ON A COALITION OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THINGS IN OUR LIFETIME. BARACK OBAMA. WE ARE GOING TO DO IT BY BRINGING IT BACK TOGETHER, BRINGING AMERICA BACK TOGETHER IN EVERY ETHNICITY, RACE, GENDER, ECONOMIC STATION. FOLKS, LOOK WE ARE GOING TO UNITE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS BUT THAT IS WHAT THE NATION NEEDS IS TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS A STATE WE HAVE TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT HERE. HE IS A HELL OF A GUY AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AND I CAN TELL YOU WE WORK SIDE-BY-SIDE TO SUPPORT THE CITY. THE PRESIDENT ASKED ME I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN DETROIT LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MICHIGAN. DURINGDURING BEAT OBAMA BY AN ADMINISTRATION, WE LOST THE RESTORATION PROJECT AND INVESTED $2.5 BILLION TO HELP MITIGATE POLLUTION. PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES, HABITATS, THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT OF THE GREAT LAKES IN DECADES AND IT'S DELIVERED AN INCREDIBLE RESULT. REVITALIZATION FOR THE WATERFRONT ALL ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE DRAWING DRAWING INTO NEW BUSINESSES ANDIN THE NEWBUSINESSES AND THE TOURISM ACTIVITY LIKE FISHING AND BOATING ON THE LAKE. FOLKS, YOU ARE THE GREATEST SOURCE OF FRESH WATER AND ALL OF THE WORLD. I'M ACTUALLY DELIVERING FOR MICHIGAN. SO MANY MICHIGANDERS HAVE JOINED US IN THIS DYNAMIC POLITICIAN BUT FIGHT HAS ONLY EXCEEDED BY CHARACTER. THERE ARE SOME AMAZING WOMEN THAT ONE IN 2018 AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE REELECTED. I THINK WE'VE BEEN DELIVERED TO A MOVEMENT WHERE YOU CAN NOT ONLY DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. IF WE THINK BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH TO BUILD A FUTURE IN THIS NATION, MAKING HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCOUNTABLE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, LOWERING DRUG PRICES AND ENSURING AND PROTECTING HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LIVE ON JUST MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. WE SHOULD BE BUILDING ON OBAMACARE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I'VE DONE IT BEFORE AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN. LEADING THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF OUR TIME AND THAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE. I WAS PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE CLIMATE ACCORD AND I WANT TO TELL YOU FIRST THING I WOULD DO IS RE- JOIN THAT ACCORD AND SOME OF THE POLLUTERS IN THE UNITED STATES SAY IT'S TIME TO UP THE ANTE. WE ARE 15% OF THE WORLDS PROBLEMS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IF THEY DON'T, IT WON'T MATTER SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO DEMAND THE WHOLE WORLD COME WITH US TO ENSURE THE QUALITY SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON YOUR ZIP CODE. BY TRIPLING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CALLED FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED. THERE IS 150,000 TEACHERS TODAY. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND COMPATIBLE WE WILL BE DOWN 2.5 MILLION EXCUSE ME, 300,000 BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2025. BAKING SURE IF WE DO THIS WE CAN SEND EVERY THREE, FOUR, 5-YEAR-OLD TO SCHOOL. REDUCING STUDENT AT BECAUSE IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN. ALL OF THOSE THAT ENGAGE IN PUBLIC SERVICE INCLUDING TEACHING THAT UP TO 50,000-DOLLAR REDUCTION AND TEACHING IN THEIR STUDENT DEBT. THAT IS WHO WE ARE AND THAT IS WHO WE HAVE TO BE. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD HAS TO CHANGE. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO HAS EMBRACED EVERY DICTATOR IN THE WORLD. IT'S NOT A JOKE. FROM PUTIN, WE'VE GOT TO REPAIR OUR ALLIANCES. I MEANT EVERY ONE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO MAKE SURE MY JOB IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE VICE PRESIDENT. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE SOLITARY ONE THAT WOULD TRADE PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES IF THEY COULD GUESS WHAT IT'S WE WILL HONOR THE COMMITMENT IF YOU PAY ME MORE MONEY. WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ASIA WE ARE IN REAL TROUBLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER AS WELL. THEY NEED US. [CHEERING] WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF SO MANY OF OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE TO ALSO BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT REWARDS WORK BECAUSE LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, WALL STREET DIDN'T BUILD AMERICA, YOU BUILT AMERICA. MY DAD USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION IS A LOT MORE THAN A PAYCHECK IT IS ABOUT YOUR DIGNITY AND PLACE IN COMMUNITY AND THE OWN SELF-WORTH BEING ABLE TO LOOK A KID IN THE EYE AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T THINK THEY CAN SAVE TO THEIR KIDS TODAY. GETTING CRUSHED. THE WORKING POOR ARE GETTING MORE POOR ON THE WAY UP. WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE BACKBONE OF THE COUNTRY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT IS ALL ABOUT DECENCY AND DIGNITY AND GIVING PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE. THAT IS WHY I AM A DEMOCRAT. [CHEERING] I THOUGHT WHEN THEY CAME OUT CARRYING TORCHES CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE WHAT IT WAS LIKE A COMPANY BY THE KU KLUX KLAN I WROTE AN ARTICLE SAYING WE ARE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA AND WE REALLY ARE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. IN ITS MOST PERILOUS MOMENT IT MEANS HAVING TO UNITE THE COUNTRY. YOU CANNOT DEFINE FOR ME BASED ON ETHNICITY AND GENDER, BASED ON RACE, NATIONAL ORIGIN. YOU CAN'T DO IT. WE ARE UNIQUE TO MOST UNIQUE IN ALL OF HISTORY. WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER BEEN FOUNDED ON AN IDEA AND THEY ARE. IT DIVIDES US THE WAY THAT HE IS USING US TO SOW DIVISION OF ANGER. PRESIDENTS NOT ONLY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT, THEY HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO HEAL. [CHEERING] AND FOLKS, WE HAVE TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS THAT ARE AIDING AND ABETTING BUT WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. WE CANNOT BECOME LIKE THEM. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT WE ARE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR WITH THE PARTY AND ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT IN FACT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE IS BY CRUSHING THE OTHER TEAM. FOLKS, WE CAN'T GET STUFF DONE IF WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO BE READY TO HEAL AND WE CAN'T BECOME LIKE THEM. WE HAVE TO HEAL OUR DIVISION OR ELSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO BE IN A JEOPARDY BEYOND WHAT IT IS NOW. OUR CHILDREN ARE LISTENING AND OUR SILENCE IS COMPLICITY. LOOK AT THE WAY HE TALKS AND TREATS PEOPLE, THE WAY THAT HE DEMONIZES PEOPLE AND RIDICULES PEOPLE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS. HE HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY AND ON OUR CHILDREN. THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE REPORTS IN SCHOOL OF KIDS MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOR. SINGLING OUT EMIGRANTS FOR RIDICULE AND HARASSMENT. WHAT DID WE THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THIS MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN TEACHERS TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IT ANY SURPRISE KIDS WOULD SAY THIS IS THE REPORT OF A STUDY DONE BY THE "WASHINGTON POST," WHILE THE PRESIDENT. NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, WHETHER FOR GOOD OR BAD AND THE WORDS HE UTTERS HAS A CORROSIVE EFFECT AND LOOK, FOLKS I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DONALD TRUMP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE OUR KIDS READ ABOUT IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GIVE HIM EIGHT YEARS HE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHO WE ARE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY. [CHEERING] THE WORLD IS WATCHING LOOKING AT US INTO SAYING WHAT AND SAYING WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA. EMBRACE OUR ENEMIES, WALK AWAY FROM OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT SO THEY KNOW ONCE AGAIN THE UNITED STATES CAN BE TRUSTED. THAT'S FOR OUR SECURITY ECONOMIC AS WELL AS SECURITY. FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE WATCHING AND IN THE YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT THIS MOMENT AND SAY WHEN IT MATTERED MOST, WHAT DID THEY DO? DID IT SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY OR WERE THEY PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH FEAR IN THIS COUNTRY, SO MUCH FEAR IN THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IN FACT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS CALLED INTO QUESTION, WE NEED HONEST TRUSTED, TRUTHFUL LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS WHAT I PROMISE YOU I WILL PROVIDE. [APPLAUSE] IT'S TIME TO GET BACK UP AND ONCE AGAIN FIGHT FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WE HOLD TO BE SELF-EVIDENT AND FIGHT FOR THE NOTION THAT AMERICA HAS TO LEAD THE WORLD TO THIS NEW GENERATION. I VIEW MYSELF AS A BRIDGE, NOT AS ANYONE ELSE. WHEN I ANNOUNCED THE CANDIDACY IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAID I THAT I WANTED TO DO IT IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE DECLARATION AND THE CONSTITUTION WERE FIRST UNVEILED UNVEILED. ALTHOUGH WE'VE NEVER LIVED UP TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS WE'VE NEVER BEFORE WALKED AWAY FROM IT. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SAVE EVERY SINGLE PRESIDENT AND MOVE THE ARK OF INCLUSION WIDER AND WIDER. WE CAN'T LET IT SHUT DOWN. THE DAYS OF THE DIVISIVENESS ARE SOON GOING TO BE OVER. AND WHEN HE IS GONE WE WILL COME BACK WE ARE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK FROM ST. PATRICK'S DAY SO IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT I QUOTE HISTORY TEACHES US BUT THEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME IT RISES UP AND WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OPEN HISTORY RISE. WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE FAIL TO FAILED TO DO WHEN WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO DONALD TRUMP IS. WE CHOOSE HOPE OVER FEAR. WE AMERICANS CHOOSE UNITY OVER DIVISION. WE CHOOSE SCIENCE OVER FICTION AND TRUTH OVER LIES. SO LET'S TAKE THIS BACK NOW. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. TAKE IT BACK. IT'S TIME. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music)(music) (music)(music) [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHEERING] IT COMES OUT TO BE A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH WE HAVE ONE CANDIDATE STANDING UP TO THE WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE-CLASS WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT ELECTION. THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. A LOOK AT EFFORTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND PROPAGANDA, PARTICULARLY FROM CHINA AND RUSSIA. THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING IS JUST UNDER TWO HOURS.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?470101-1/joe-biden-campaign-event-detroit	Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, held a campaign event in Detroit. He was introduced by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D), and Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), both former 2020 presidential candidates who endorsed Mr. Biden&rsquo;s campaign after ending their own bids. Mr. Biden thanked them for their support and spoke about the importance of winning the state of Michigan in its March 10 primary.

CSPANKH27202015	Kamala Harris	2020-07-02	Senator Harris on Police Reform	THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE ENGAGED IN AFGHANISTAN IN A WAY THAT'S ADVERSE TO THE UNITED STATES IS NOTHING NEW. BY THE WAY. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OUT THERE SUGGESTING THEY ARE SHOCKED AND APPALLED BY THIS, THEY SAW THE SAME INTELLIGENCE WE SAW. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY DID WHEN THEY SAW WHATEVER INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE REFERRING TO. THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION AS WELL. NOT JUST THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES, BY THE WAY. EVEN MORE BROADLY THAN THAT. WE TOOK THIS SERIOUSLY. WE HANDLED IT APPROPRIATELY. THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN SELLING SMALL ARMS TO PUT AMERICANS AT RISK THERE FOR 10 YEARS. WE'VE OBJECTED TO IT, TO YOUR POINT. WHEN I MEET WITH MY RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS I TALK TO THEM EACH TIME. STOP THIS. WE THINK WE HAVE A NOT PERFECT BUT SOMEWHAT OVERLAPPING OBJECTIVE IN AFGHANISTAN. IT'S ON THEIR DOORSTEP. WE KNOW THEY WERE ROUTED IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY HAVE AN OBJECTIVE THERE, TOO, TO REDUCE THE RISK OF TERRORISM THERE. SO, YES, MAYBE NOT EVERY TIME, BUT WITH GREAT FREQUENCY, WHEN I SPEAK TO MY RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS WE TALK ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT WE DON'T WANT THEM ENGAGED IN THIS. BUT IT'S , JUST SO EVERYBODY CAN , (music) THERE IS A MOVEMENT AT PLAY HERE AND THAT MOVEMENT DID NOT START A FEW WEEKS AGO. THAT MOVEMENT STARTED BEFORE EMMIT TILL. THAT MOVEMENT WAS ACTIVE AND AT PLAY DURING THE BEATING OF RODNEY KING. WE'RE PART OF A MOVEMENT THAT STARTED A LONG TIME AGO, AND THIS MOVEMENT WILL NOT BE DETERRED. (music) SO THE SPECIAL "WASHINGTON POST" LIVE WHICH IS A LIVE REPORTING OF MY PODCAST, I'M JOHN, OPINION WRITER FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND MY GUEST IS RETURNING FOR THE FOURTH TIME TO THE PODCAST, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST MONTH, SENATOR HARRIS HAS CO-SPONSORED THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT, CO-AUTHORED THE BIPARTISAN HARRIS , HELPED INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION DENYING A TAX ON THE KAROLINA MUCHOVA AND HELP INTRODUCE THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT ACCOUNTABILITY DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. HARRIS IS THE FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN FRANCISCO, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, MADE A RUN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION, AND IS NOW TALKED ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL RUNNINGMATE FOR JOE BIDEN. RIGHT NOW, HARRIS IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE SENATE, IN THE SENATE DEBATE ON POLICE REFORM, AND SHE JOINS ME NOW. SENATOR HARRIS, WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE GET TO POLICE REFORM, WE HAVE TO GET TO INTELLIGENCE AND THE RUSSIA STORY OBTAINED BOUNTIES ON THE LIVES OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. YOU ATTENDED A BRIEFING REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS THAT RUSSIA WAS INVOLVED IN THIS. GIVEN WHAT YOU LEARNED, IS THE INTELLIGENCE , IS THE INTELLIGENCE IN DOUBT? I WOULD SAY THAT I, DURING THE COURSE OF MY THREE-PLUS YEARS OF BEING ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND, THEREFORE, IN REGULAR RECEIPT OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT THE THREATS TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND HOT SPOTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT I HAVE COME TO RESPECT, HIGHLY RESPECT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PROFESSIONALISM, FOR THE DETAIL, AND THE PRECISION WITH WHICH THEY WORK AND THE ENORMITY OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH IS TO INFORM US AS POLICYMAKERS, TO INFORM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN A WAY WE CAN MAKE SMART DECISIONS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION'S SECURITY. OK, GIVEN WHAT YOU LEARNED, IS IT CREDIBLE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS INTELLIGENCE, ABOUT THE RUSSIANS PAYING TALIBAN BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS? I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO SHARE WITH YOU CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, BUT I WILL SAY THIS. IT IS WELL-KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD THAT PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO CONCERN HIMSELF OR HERSELF WITH THE WELL-BEING OF OUR SERVICE MEMBERS WHO SACRIFICED AND ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES IN HONOR AND IN PROTECTION OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR SECURITY. AND IT WOULD BE , IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT THOSE MEN AND WOMEN AND EXPRESSES SOME LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT THEIR WELL-BEING. BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT WITH DONALD TRUMP IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. HE DOESN'T WANT , HE WANTS TO HAVE A MILITARY PARADE BUT THE REALITY IS, I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN, I'VE BEEN TO THESE HOT SPOTS, AND OUR FOLKS NEED A PRESIDENT AND A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO HAS THEIR BEST INTEREST AS HIS OR HER FIRST PRIORITY. WE JUST FRANKLY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT FROM DONALD TRUMP. SO GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND GIVEN THE BRIEFINGS YOU JUST ATTENDED, BUT ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP, DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT? IN MANY WAYS, I THINK THAT HE'S NOT , HE HAS NOT SHROUDED HIS TENURE AS PRESIDENT, PRIORITIZED WHAT'S IN THE PRESIDENTBEST INTEREST AND WELL-BEING. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR COUNTRY, WHICH IS THE PANDEMIC. AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, DONALD TRUMP REFERRED TO IT AS A HOAX. HE SPENT FULL TIME TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT. HE'S ATTEMPTED TO MUZZLE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS AND TO DENY THE REALITIES OF THE HARM AND ALSO WHAT WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THE HARMS SUCH AS WEARING A MASK AND BASIC THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO STEM THE TIDE OF THIS VIRUS UNTIL WE GET A VACCINE. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT ON THE ISSUE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND THE FACT HE'S BEEN BASICALLY A SCIENCE DENIER. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FACTS, AGAIN, OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR, UNANIMOUS IN ITS FINDING OF RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT IN 2016. AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OR THE VERACITY OF THAT INFORMATION. SO WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES THAT TELL US THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT WELL EQUIPPED, IF AT ALL EQUIPPED, TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. WHY WON'T THE PRESIDENT TAKE ACTION AGAINST RUSSIA? I MEAN, THIS LATEST STORY ISN'T THE FIRST TIME RUSSIA HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT GOES COUNTER TO EITHER AMERICA'S INTERESTS OR THE INTERESTS OF THE NATO ALLIANCE. SO WHY WON'T HE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOME OF THE EGREGIOUS THINGS THAT THEY'VE DONE? I CAN'T SPECULATE OR GET INTO THE MIND OF DONALD TRUMP. AND I THINK, FRANKLY, I'M TOO BUSY LOOKING AT WHAT HE'S DOING TO WORRY ABOUT HOW HE'S THINKING. THE FACT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS ACTIONS AND HIS CONDUCT, HE'S NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN ADVERSARY, A LONG-STANDING ADVERSARY, WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES AND CLEARLY INCAPABLE OF SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE RESPONSE THAT OUR COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE WHEN WE ARE ATACTED , ATTACKED IN ANY FORM. SENATOR, ARE YOU SURPRISED THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE SILENCE FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY? WELL, YOU KNOW, JONATHAN, I WAS ELECTED BITTERSWEET ON THE SAME EVENING AS DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED. SO I'VE ONLY KNOWN ONE SENATE AND THAT'S THE SENATE WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. AND IT HAS BEEN TROUBLING. IT HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF SADNESS AND FRUSTRATION TO SEE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE NOT STAND UP IN A WAY THAT I BELIEVE THEY WOULD IF PERHAPS DONALD TRUMP WEREN'T PRESIDENT. I DON'T , I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AT SOME POINT WE EACH CAN'T FEEL COMPELLED TO PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY. SO IT IS DEEPLY TROUBLING, AND WE NEED TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES LIKE NATIONAL SECURITY THAT IT SHOULD BE NONPARTISAN. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC AND CRISIS WHERE ALMOST 130,000 LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST 100 DAYS THAT WE SHOULD ALL STAND UP AND LOOK AT THE NEED FOR OUR COUNTRY TO HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT SEES THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING AND FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE POLITICAL PRIORITIES OR THREATS OF A PRESIDENT. SENATOR, LET'S TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS GOING TO BE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AND THAT WAS ON POLICE REFORM. SENATOR TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA WAS LEADING THE REPUBLICAN , LEADING THE REPUBLICAN EFFORT ON THEIR JUSTICE ACT. BUT YOU, ALONG WITH SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER AND SENATOR COREY BOOKER OF NEW JERSEY, YOU SIGNED A LETTER TO THE MAJORITY LEADER SAYING THE JUSTICE ACT WAS, QUOTE, IS NOT SALVAGEABLE. WHY , WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE LEGISLATION PROPOSED BY SENATOR SCOTT AND WHY WASN'T IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOU TO GET IN A ROOM AND NEGOTIATE A DEAL SINCE THERE IS PUBLIC SENTIMENT BEHIND DOING SOMETHING TO REFORM THE POLICE? RECALL THE CHRONOLOGY OF THIS. WHICH IS THAT SENATOR BOOKER AND I PROPOSED ON THE SENATE SIDE, ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS ON THE HOUSE SIDE, AND THEN IT WAS JOINED BY SENATE DEMOCRATS AND SENATE DEMOCRATS IN THE , DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE SIDE A BILL. WE CAME UP WITH A BILL CALLED THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT, WHICH WOULD DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT RELATES TO THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BREAK THE RULES AND BREAK THE LAW. NINE DAYS LATER, NINE DAYS LATER, THE REPUBLICANS SUBMIT THIS BILL THAT ESSENTIALLY DEALT WITH NOTHING IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY THAT WE DEALT WITH IN OUR BILL. IN OUR BILL, FOR EXAMPLE, WE BANNED CHOKEHOLDS AND KROTIC HOLD , KRAD I HAD HOLDS. NO-KNOCK WARRANTS. IF THAT WERE IN EFFECT, BRIE BRIE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. , BREONNA TAYLOR WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. AND WHEN AN OFFICER USES EXCESSIVE FORCE, THE QUESTION WOULD NOT BE, WAS THAT USE OF FORCE REASONABLE? BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN REASON AWAY ANYTHING. THE QUESTION IS, WAS THAT USE OF FORCE NECESSARY? WE DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF VARYERY SPECIFIC ISSUES. WE SAY THERE SHOULD BE PATTERN IN PRACTICE INVESTIGATION BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEY SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH SUBPOENA POWER SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE THEY HAVE THE TOOL TO DO THE INVESTIGATION. THE REPUBLICAN BILL, BY CONTRAST, DID NOT BAN CHOKEHOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS AND NO McKNOCK WARRANTS , NO-KNOCK WARRANTS IN DRUG CASES, INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND THE NEED FOR THOSE AND INSTEAD TALKS ABOUT A BUNCH OF STUDIES AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO HAVE CONVERSATION. LOOK, WE'RE GOING , WE'VE BEEN HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS FOR DECADES NOW. THIS IS A TIME TO ACT AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. PEOPLE WHO SEEMINGLY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WHO HAVE BEEN MARCHING TOGETHER KNOWING WE CANNOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA AND WE NEED TO REFORM THIS SYSTEM IN TANGIBLE WAYS, NOT JUST GIVING IT LIP SERVICE, BUT ACTUALLY PUTTING SOME TEETH INTO THIS. WELL, SENATOR, BECAUSE POLICING ISN'T DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, IT'S BEEN DONE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL, YOU'RE MORE POWERFUL AS D.A. OF SAN FRANCISCO OR ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA THAN YOU ARE NOW AS THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. IF YOU WERE EITHER OF THOSE POSITIONS RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT, WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU COULD DO SUBSTANTIVELY TO REFORM THE POLICE? WELL, IT'S A NUMBER OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. EVERYTHING THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO YOU IS ABOUT CREATING NATIONAL STANDARDS. AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY REGULATE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT ALSO CREATES A NATIONAL STANDARD TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL ACTIVISTS OR THE PROGRESSIVE PROSECUTORS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS WHO KNOW THAT'S WHERE THEY NEED TO GET AND THEY NEED , SOME MORE REINFORCEMENT TO ACTUALLY GET THEIR POLICIES TO THAT STANDARD. AND SO THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE MAJORITY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORK IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT THAT DOESN'T ABSOLVE A NEED FOR NATIONAL STANDARDS TO, AGAIN, CREATE A STANDARD BY WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD BE MEASURED. SO SENATOR, THIS SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW REMINDS ME OF GUN CONTROL , THE GUN CONTROL ENVIRONMENT IN THE WAKE OF NEWTOWN WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE BETWEEN PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND ACTION ON CAPITOL HILL THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE AND YET NOTHING WAS DONE. I'M GETTING THE FEELING THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE HERE. ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS COULD BE AND IT MIGHT BE THE CASE TO FLIP THE SENATE, TO HAVE THE DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. AND I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A QUESTION FROM PENNSYLVANIA, FROM KATHRYN, AND SHE ASKS POINT BLANK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP FLIP THE SENATE? YEAH. SO KATHRYN, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE AS DEMOCRATS ARE NOT IN THE MAJORITY. AND IT IS REALLY BASIC ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AROUND CAPITOL HILL IN THE SENATE. IF YOU'RE IN THE MAJORITY, YOU GET TO WRITE THE RULES. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT BILLS ARE GOING TO COME UP FOR VOTES. YOU GET TO DECIDE WHO WILL END UP SERVING LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS ON THE FEDERAL COURTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF POWER IN WHO HAS THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. SO YOU ARE RIGHT. WE ARE NOW IN THE MINORITY, WHICH MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THESE THINGS. AND WE NEED TO FLIP THE SENATE SO WE CAN GET IN THE MAJORITY SO WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE THAT IS ABOUT MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM, SO THAT WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION UP FOR A VOTE THAT IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, SO WE CAN HAVE LEGISLATION THAT IS ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE AROUND THE PASSAGE OF CREATING A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR IMMIGRANTS. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. HOW DO WE DO IT? WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE SENATE CANDIDATES WHO ARE GOING TO TURN RED STATES BLUE. I HAVE A LIST OF WHO THEY ARE. I HAVE BEEN HOSTING A LOT OF THE NEW CANDIDATES WHO ARE CHALLENGING INCURVENTS AS A WAY , INCUMBENTS AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE THEM BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE THAT THE NEW CANDIDATES ARE HAVING, THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING WITHOUT PLANNING FOR IT IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC SO THEY CAN'T TRAVEL. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEEK THEM OUT. BUT LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE AND ELECT JOE BIDEN PRESIDENT AND WE'VE GOT TO FLIP THE SENATE BECAUSE THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY SEE PROGRESS IN OUR COUNTRY. TOWO QUICK QUESTIONS. I KNOW YOU HAVE A HARD OUT AND HAVE TO GO. WHAT DOES IT SAY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS STILL TRYING TO UNDO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC? JUST SPEAKS TO THE HEARTLESSNESS OF THE PROPOSAL AND PERSPECTIVE. FROM DAY ONE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THEY , AND I THINK DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO UNDO WHATEVER SUCCESS AND ACCOMPLISHMENT WAS ACHIEVED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. AND SO THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT REPEALING AND REPLACE. THERE'S BEEN NO PLAN WHATSOEVER FOR REPLACE. IT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET RID OF A PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVE THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. AND TO YOUR POINT, RIGHT NOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS BILL BARR AND THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY WIN, 23 MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND IT WILL ALSO, THEN, ALLOW THE BANS ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT WE HAD BEFORE. SO THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED NOW OVER 128,000 PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE HEARTLESSNESS, IT SPEAKS TO THE MOTIVATIONS THAT IS ABOUT POLITICAL GAIN AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY. FINAL QUESTION. SHAMALA WAS 19 WHEN SHE CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM INDIA TO GET A DOCTORATE AT BERKLEY. SHE BECAME A BREAST CANCER RESEARCHER. SHE DIED OF CANCER IN 2009, AND SHE WAS YOUR MOTHER. YOU WROTE IN YOUR BOOK, TRUTH BE HOLD, THAT YOU AND YOUR SISTER, MAYA, QUOTE, RARELY EARNED PRAISE FOR BEHAVIOR OR ACHIEVEMENTS THAT WERE EXPECTED. SO FINAL QUESTION TO YOU, SENATOR. WHAT WOULD SHE SAY ABOUT ALL THE TALK THAT HER DAUGHTER COULD BE TAPPED TO BE JOE BIDEN'S RUNNINGMATE AND POSSIBLY THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS , AND I, THEREFORE, I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU INSTEAD OF LOOKING TO THE THING OVER THERE BECAUSE THE THING IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION. AND RIGHT NOW MY FOCUS, THEREFORE, IS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO AROUND ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS, IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT, ECONOMIC IMPACT. MY FOCUS IS PASSING THE JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT. THESE ARE THE THINGS FRONT AND CENTER. THESE ARE THE THINGS CAUSING PEOPLE TOO STAND IN BREAD LINES AND MARCHING IN THE STREET. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON. AND MY MOTHER WAS VERY PRACTICAL. YOU'VE NOT MET A MORE PRACTICAL PERSON IN YOUR LIFE. SHE WAS A FIGHTER AND SHE WAS PRACTICAL. AND SHE WOULD SAY, BABY, JUST FOCUS ON WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AS THE NEXT THING, WHATEVER THAT'S MEANT TO BE, WILL COME. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU. "WASHINGTON POST" LIVE WILL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH PRESIDENT AND C.E.O. BARBARA HUNTON AND MY COLLEAGUE, ROBIN, WILL INTERVIEW THE FOUNDER AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF BROTHER BAYLESE. JONATHAN CAPEHART OF "THE WASHINGTON POST." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HAPPY FOURTH.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?473613-1/senator-harris-police-reform	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke with <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Jonathan Capehart about police and criminal justice reform. Senator Harris was considered a potential running mate for Joe Biden, the 2020 presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. She deferred comment on that possibility, saying she wanted to focus on her work in the Senate, particularly on the federal government&rsquo;s response to the coronavirus pandemic as well as police and criminal justice reform.	473613-1	Speech
CSPANKH128202016	Kamala Harris	2020-08-12	Joe Biden Introduction of Senator Kamala Harris as Running Mate	I WANT TO MENTION HOW WHEN KAMALA HARRIS WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, SHE ARRESTED A REPORTER WHO WAS INVESTIGATING PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND SHE CHARGED HIM WITH 15 FELONIES. HE'S BEEN IN THE COURTS FIGHTING THIS FOR YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE, HE GOT TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THAT THEY SOLD ABORTED BABY BODY PARTS FOR PROFIT. THEY ALSO CHANGED THE ABORTION PROCEDURE TO GIVE BETTER PARTS , HELLO, HELLO. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I WISH WE WERE ABLE TO TALK TO FOLKS OUTSIDE, BUT WE ARE KEEPING OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND PLAYING BY THE RULES. GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE. TO ME AND TO KAMALA, THIS IS AN EXCITING DAY. THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR CAMPAIGN AND A GREAT GAME FOR , GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA, IN OUR VIEW. I HAVE HAD THE INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE WITH MEETING AND SPENDING TIME WITH A TALENTED GROUP OF WOMEN LEADERS, ALL OF WHOM ARE QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT. WITH EACH ONE, THE MORE I LEARN ABOUT THEM, THE MORE I TALK TO THEM, THE MORE IMPRESSED I WAS, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THAT BEFORE. I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM FOR BEING PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE REBUILD THIS COUNTRY, TO GET ELECTED AND ONCE WE ARE ELECTED, GOD WILLING. I APPROACH THIS WITH A SERIOUSNESS, A PURPOSE AND A MIND, BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS MOMENT FOR OUR NATION. WE ARE AT ONE OF THOSE INFLECTION POINTS , YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THAT BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY. A LIFE-CHANGING ELECTION FOR THIS NATION. THE CHOICE , THE CHOICE WE MAKE THIS NOVEMBER IS GOING TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF AMERICA FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. AND I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. I HAD A GREAT CHOICE, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I PICKED THE RIGHT PERSON TO JOIN ME AS THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND THAT'S SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. IT SEEMS THAT AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THIS NATION, AT LEAST AT THE OUTSET HERE, AGREE WITH ME. YESTERDAY WE HAD OUR BEST GRASSROOTS FUNDRAISING DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN, MORE THAN DOUBLE OUR PREVIOUS RECORD, AND IN DOING SO WE SET A SINGLE DAY RECORD FOR ONLINE POLITICAL FUNDRAISING. I THINK I KNOW I. , I KNOW WHY. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US AS WELL, THOSE WHO LISTEN TODAY. GO TO JOEBIDEN.COM TODAY. FIVE DOLLARS, $10, WHATEVER. KAMALA IS SMART, SHE IS TOUGH, EXPERIENCED. SHE IS A PROVEN FIGHTER FOR THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, THE MIDDLE CLASS. ARE ALL THOSE STRUGGLING TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, KAMALA KNOWS HOW TO GOVERN. SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THE HARD CALLS. SHE IS READY TO DO THIS JOB ON DAY ONE. WE ARE BOTH READY TO GET TO WORK REBUILDING THIS NATION AND BUILDING IT BETTER. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE LARGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY, KAMALA TOOK ON THE BIG BANKS OVER MORTGAGE FRAUD AND WON. TOOK ON BIG OIL, WHO WANTED TO POLLUTE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. SHE IS A PIONEER IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND TACKLED THE GUN LOBBY. YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALL WATCHED THE UNITED STATES SENATE GO TOE TO TOE WITH TRUMP OFFICIALS, TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH, ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED AND NOT , , BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SHE HAS BEEN THE SENATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOST MASSIVE SECURITY CHALLENGES OUR COUNTRY FACES. WELL AWARE, WELL AWARE OF ALL THE THREATS TO THIS NATION AND READY TO RESPOND TO THEM. AS A CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS, SHE KNOWS PERSONALLY HOW IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ENRICH OUR COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES OF WHAT IT MEANS TO GROW UP BLACK AND INDIAN-AMERICAN IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMERICA , IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HER STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND MANY PARTICULARS, BUT NOT SO DIFFERENT IN THE ESSENTIALS. SHE HAS WORKED HARD, SHE HAS NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE, AND SHE HAS EARNED EACH AND EVERY OF THE ACCOLADES AND ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SHE HAS GAINED, MANY OF THEM OFTEN IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES THAT OTHERS PUT IN HER WAY, BUT NEVER QUIT. THIS MORNING, ALL ACROSS THE NATION, LITTLE GIRLS WOKE UP, ESPECIALLY LITTLE BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS, WHO SO OFTEN FEEL OVERLOOKED AND UNDERVALUED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, BUT TODAY , TODAY, JUST MAYBE, THEY ARE SEEING THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A NEW WAY, AS THE STUFF OF PRESIDENTS AND VICE PRESIDENTS. IN HER CAMPAIGN IN THE PRIMARY, KAMALA OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE 3:00 A.M. AGENDA, THE MOMS AND DADS AWAKE LATE AT NIGHT IN THEIR KITCHENS, WORRIED, SCARED, UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO PAY THE BILLS, ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO SIMPLY MAKE IT. GROWING UP IN SCRANTON IN CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, I SAW THAT STRUGGLE WITH MY FAMILY AS WELL AS HE KAMALA SAW IT WITH HERS AS WELL. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING THAT STRUGGLE AS WE SPEAK, ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY JOBS LOST. KAMALA AND I BOTH KNOW JUST GIVE ME A SHOT, A FAIR SHOT. A SHOT AT MAKING IT. AND IT WILL BE THE WORK OF OUR ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THEY GET A FAIR SHOT. WORKING FAMILIES NEED SOMEONE ON THEIR SIDE IN THIS NATION, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN THE PRESIDENT NOW ON THEIR SIDE. THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN A BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. IT IS GOING TO BE GRATIFYING TO SEE THE STRONG, ENTHUSIASTIC REACTION TO SENATOR HARRIS AS OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, IT COMES FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IT IS ALREADY OCCURRING. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, ALL IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS, ALL BACKGROUNDS. EVENTS, WE ARE PREDICTABLE AND SOME OF THEM. IT COMES FROM ALL OTHER EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE AND HIS ALLIES. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. YOU COULD HAVE SET YOUR WATCH IS TO IT. DONALD TRUMP HAS ALREADY STARTED HIS ATTACKS, CALLING KAMALA NASTY, WHINING ABOUT SHE IS MEAN TO HER APPOINTEES. IT IS NO SURPRISE, BECAUSE WHINING IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES BEST, BETTER THAN ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. IS ANYONE SURPRISED DONALD TRUMP AS A PROBLEM WITH A STRONG WOMAN OR WOMEN ACROSS THE BOARD? LET'S BE CLEAR. IF YOU ARE A WORKING PERSON WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER YOU WILL HAVE A JOB TO GO TO, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR MORTGAGE, YOUR RENT, WORRIED ABOUT THE POISON IN THE AIR YOU BREATHE, THE WATER YOU DRINK, WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS, YOUR RIGHTS TO BASIC DIGNITY, WHICH IS UNDER ATTACK BY THIS ADMINISTRATION, KAMALA HARRIS HAS HAD YOUR BACK, AND NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE HER BACK. SHE IS GOING TO STAND WITH ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR HER. ON JANUARY 20, 2021, WE WILL WATCH SENATOR HARRIS RAISE HER RIGHT HAND AND SWEAR THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO SERVE AS THE SECOND HIGHEST OFFICE IN AMERICA, IN THIS LAND. AND THEN WE WILL GET TO WORK FIXING THE MESS THAT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE CREATED, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD THROUGH FOUR YEARS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND MODELING OF TERRORISTS AND THUGS AROUND THE WORLD. NOT ONLY WILL AMERICA DIG ITSELF OUT OF HIS HOLD A PUT US IN, WE WILL BUILD BACK. WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. KAMALA HARRIS IS IN COURT , DONALD IS IN COURT TRYING TO DO AWAY WITH HEALTH CARE. I 165,000 PEOPLE DEAD AND CLIMBING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COVID-19, AND STILL MONTHS LATER, NO REAL LEADERSHIP OR PLAN FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOW TO GET THIS PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. NO REAL HELP FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO FILL THE VACUUM OF LEADERSHIP FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. NO REAL HELP FOR CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FRONT-LINE WORKERS HOLDING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER. INSTEAD, HE IS ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MAKING PROMISES THAT IN THE END WILL DEFUND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM WHILE INSISTING THAT THIS VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR. THE JOE BIDEN KAMALA HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF COVID-19 AND TURNED THE CORNER ON THIS PANDEMIC. MASKING, CLEAR SCIENCE-BASED GUIDANCE, DRAMATICALLY SCALING UP TESTING, GETTING STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO OPEN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES SAFELY. WE CAN DO THIS. WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WILLING TO LEAD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. NOT AS THIS PRESIDENT SAYS, IT IS NOT MY FAULT. THE GOVERNORS SHOULD THANK ME MORE. AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, GIVE ME A BREAK. WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS, 16 MILLION STILL OUT OF WORK. DONALD TRUMP IS ON TRACK TO BREAK ANOTHER RECORD, ON TRACK TO LEAVE OFFICE WITH THE WORST JOBS RECORD OF ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT IN MODERN HISTORY, BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK, MEETING FACE-TO-FACE WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE LIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN A CRISIS TO GET AMERICANS THE RELIEF THEY NEED AND DESERVE, DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE GOLF COURSE. IF I TOLD YOU THIS THREE YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME LIKE I WAS BEING CRAZY. HE HAS NOT EVEN MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME, IT APPEARS. WE HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS, AND DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE. WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, ALL WE HEAR IS THE WORD HOAX. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MEET THE CLIMATE CRISIS, PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND ALONG THE WAY, WE WILL DELIVER ONE WORD, JOBS. GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE A RACIAL JUSTICE CRISIS. DONALD TRUMP SEEKS ONLY TO INFLAME IT WITH THIS POLITICS OF RACIST RHETORIC AND APPEALS TO THE VISION. TODAY IS NOT ONLY THE DAY I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE OF THE PARTY, IT IS ALSO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO SEE THOSE NEO-NAZIS AND THOSE KLANSMEN, WHITE SUPREMACISTS COMING OUT OF FIELDS CARRYING LIGHTED TORCHES, FACES CONTORTED, BULGING VEINS, POURING INTO THE STREETS OF HISTORIC AMERICAN CITIES SPEWING THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC BIO WE HEARD IN HITLER'S GERMANY IN THE 1930'S. REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT TO SEE A VIOLENT CLASH ENSUE BETWEEN THOSE CELEBRATING HATE AND THOSE STANDING AGAINST IT? IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL FOR ALL OF US AS A COUNTRY, FOR ME, A CALL TO ACTION. MY FATHER USED TO SAY AT SILENCE IS COMPLICITY, NOT ORIGINAL TO HIM, BUT HE BELIEVED IT. I KNEW I COULD NOT STAND BY AND LET DONALD TRUMP, A MAN WHO WENT ON TO SAY WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE SAID THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS EVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE HIM CONTINUE TO ATTACK EVERYTHING THAT MAKES AMERICA AMERICA. I KNEW WE WERE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE NATION. THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO RUN. I AM PROUD NOW TO HAVE SENATOR HARRIS AT MY SIDE IN THAT BATTLE , BECAUSE SHE SHARES THE SAME INTENSITY I DO. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IS AT STAKE. THE QUESTION IS FOR ALL AMERICANS TO ANSWER, WHO ARE WE AS A NATION? WHAT DO WE STAND FOR? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE? YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS LIMITED ONLY BY THE BARRIERS WE PLACE ON OUR OWN IMAGINATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING AMERICANS CANNOT ACHIEVE WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND WE DO IT TOGETHER. ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE KAMALA AS WE BOTH BELIEVE WE CAN DIVIDE AMERICA SIMPLY IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITIES. POSSIBILITIES. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. POSSIBILITIES, THAT IS AMERICA. THAT IS WHAT SETS THIS NATION APART IS THAT EVERYONE, EVERYONE, THE ABILITY FOR EVERYONE, AND WE MEAN EVERYONE TO GO AS FAR A DREAM AS BIG AS HARD WORK AND THEIR GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. WHEN I AGREED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RUNNING MATE, HE ASKED ME A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED KAMALA. THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ME, HE ASKED WHAT I WANTED, MOST IMPORTANTLY? I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO BE THE LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM BEFORE HE MADE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT IS WHAT I ASKED KAMALA. I ASKED HER TO BE THE LAST VOICE OF THE ROOM, TO ALWAYS TELL ME THE TRUTH, AND SHE WILL. CHALLENGE MY ASSUMPTIONS IF SHE DISAGREES. ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE WAY WE MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME AT MY HOME TODAY WITH KAMALA AND DOUG, AND I WANT TO THANK THEM AND THANK THEM PUBLICLY FOR AGREEING TO JOIN AND TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH JILL AND ME. DOUG, YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BARRIER BREAKER YOURSELF IN THIS JOB YOU ARE ABOUT TO TAKE ON. AMERICA'S FIRST SECOND GENTLEMAN , AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY, I WANT TO THANK ELLEN AND COAL AS WELL. I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO DOUG'S MOM AND DAD, AND WE ARE GOING TO GET OUR KIDS TOGETHER TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT IS COMING. MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ABOUT THE AGE OF THEIR CHILDREN. I GOT TO SPEAK TO THEM. MY CAMPAIGN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAMILY AFFAIR, EVERY CAMPAIGN I HAVE RUN, SO I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU. YOU ARE ALL HONORARY BIDENS. HERE IS THE BEST PART. YOU HAVE BEEN AN HONORARY BIDENS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I CAME FIRST TO KNOW WHO KAMALA THROUGH OUR SON BEAU BIDEN. THEY WERE FRIENDS. THEY SERVED AS ATTORNEYS GENERAL AT THE SAME TIME. THEY TOOK ON THE SAME BIG FIGHTS TOGETHER. KAMALA IN CALIFORNIA, BO IN DELAWARE. BIG FIGHTS THAT HELP CHANGE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH BEAU RESPECTED KAMALA AND HER WORK. THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME AS I MADE THIS DECISION. NOW WE NEED TO GET TO WORK PULLING THIS NATION OUT OF THESE CRISES WE FIND OURSELVES IN. ENDING OUR ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK, UNITING THIS NATION, AND WINNING THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LET ME INTRODUCE TO YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME YOUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS . THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JOE. AS I SAID WHEN YOU CALLED ME, I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED BY THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. I AM READY TO GET TO WORK. AFTER THE MOST COMPETITIVE PRIMARY IN HISTORY, THE COUNTRY RECEIVED A RESOUNDING MESSAGE THAT JOE WAS THE PERSON TO LEAD US FORWARD, AND I AM SO PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU, AND I DO SO MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE HEROIC AND AMBITIOUS WOMEN BEFORE ME WHOSE SACRIFICE, DETERMINATION, AND RESILIENCE MAKES MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY EVEN POSSIBLE. THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL CONSEQUENCE FOR AMERICA. EVERYTHING WE CARE ABOUT, OUR ECONOMY, OUR HEALTH, OUR CHILDREN, THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. WE ARE REALLY , REALLY , REELING FROM THE WORST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. AT THE PRESIDENT'S MISMANAGEMENT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS PLUNGED US INTO THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING A MORAL RECKONING WITH RACISM AND SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE THAT HAS BROUGHT A NEW COALITION OF CONSCIENCE TO THE STREETS OF OUR COUNTRY DEMANDING CHANGE. AMERICA IS CRYING OUT FOR LEADERSHIP, YET WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CARES MORE ABOUT HIMSELF THAN THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM, A PRESIDENT WHO IS MAKING EVERY CHALLENGE WE FACE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SOLVE, BUT HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FAILED GOVERNMENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE. IN JUST 83 DAYS, WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHOOSE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY. SO, JOE, DR. BIDEN, THANK YOU FOR THE TRUST YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. JILL, I KNOW YOU WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY, AND MY HUSBAND DOUG AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL, GRATEFUL TO BECOME A PART OF YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. EVER SINCE I RECEIVED JO'S CALL, I HAVE BEEN THINKING, YES, ABOUT THE FIRST BIDEN I REALLY CAME TO KNOW, AND THAT OF COURSE IS JO'S BELOVED SON BEAU. IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION, BEAU AND I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY WORKING TOGETHER TO WIN BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR HOMEOWNERS FROM THE BIG BANKS OF THE NATION THAT WERE FORECLOSING ON PEOPLE'S HOMES, AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BEAU BIDEN, I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT BEAU WAS THE KIND OF GUY WHO INSPIRED PEOPLE TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF THEMSELVES. HE REALLY WAS THE BEST OF US. WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOVE THAT THEY SHARED WAS INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY OF THE LOVE BETWEEN A FATHER AND A SON. AND BEAU TALKED ABOUT HOW JOE WOULD SPEND EVERY DAY WRITING THE RAILS FROM WILMINGTON TO WASHINGTON, D.C. SO HE COULD MAKE BREAKFAST FOR HIS KIDS IN THE MORNING AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME TO TUCK THEM IN BED EACH NIGHT. ALL OF THIS SO TWO LITTLE BOYS: I JUST LOST THEIR MOM AND SISTER IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT WOULD KNOW THAT THE WORLD WAS STILL TURNING, AND THAT IS HOW I CAME TO KNOW JOE. HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH IS NEVER TO THINK ABOUT HIMSELF, BUT TO CARE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. HE IS SOMEONE WHO NEVER ASKED, WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME, AND INSTEAD ASKS, WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR YOU? IS EMPATHY, HIS COMPUTER , HIS EMPATHY, AND HIS COMPASSION, AND HIS SENSE OF DUTY TO CARE FOR OTHERS IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO BE ON THIS TICKET. JOE AND I, YES, WE ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. I CANNOT WAIT FOR AMERICA TO GET TO KNOW MY HUSBAND DOUG AND OUR AMAZING KIDS, BECAUSE WHETHER I AM CHEERING IN THE BLEACHERS AT A SWIM MEET WERE SETTING UP A COLLEGE ROOM DOOR OR HELPING MY GODDAUGHTER PREPARE FOR MY SCHOOL , FOR HER SCHOOL DEBATE OR BUILDING LEGOS WITH MY GODSON OR HUGGING MY TWO BABY NIECES OR COOKING DINNER, SUNDAY DINNER, MY FAMILY MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TITLES OVER MY CAREER, AND CERTAINLY VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE GREAT, BUT MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE THAT MEANS THE MOST. MY MOTHER AND FATHER, THEY CAME FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE WORLD TO ARRIVE IN AMERICA. ONE FROM INDIA, AND THE OTHER FROM JAMAICA IN SEARCH OF A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION, BUT WHAT BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER WAS THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OF THE 1960'S, AND THAT IS HOW THEY MET, AS STUDENTS IN THE STREETS OF OAKLAND MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR THIS THING CALLED JUSTICE AND A STRUGGLE THAT CONTINUES TODAY. I WAS PART OF IT. MY PARENTS WOULD BRING ME TO PROTESTS STRAPPED TIGHTLY IN MY STROLLER, AND MY MOTHER RAISED MY SISTER MAIA AND ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS UP TO US AND EVERY GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO KEEP ON MARCHING. SHE WOULD TELL US, DO NOT SIT AROUND AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THINGS, DO SOMETHING. SO I DID SOMETHING. I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MAKING REAL THE WORDS CARVED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. ADD 30 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE A JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREATHED DEEP AND UTTERED THE PHRASE THAT WOULD TRULY GUIDE MY CAREER AND THE REST OF MY CAREER, KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE, THAT IS WHO I HAVE REPRESENTED AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS WHO NEEDED HELP, THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHO I VOTE FOR IS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN I TOOK ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAFFIC AND GUNS AND DRUGS AND HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS THE PEOPLE WHO LIFT HAVE FOUGHT FOR AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, WHERE I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE ARE WHO JOE AND I WILL FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PRESENTED MY FAIR SHARE OF ARGUMENTS IN COURT, THE CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE IS OPEN AND SHUT. JUST LOOK AT THEY HAVE GOTTEN US. MORE THAN 16 MILLION OUT OF WORK , MILLIONS OF KIDS WHO CANNOT GO BACK TO SCHOOL, A CRISIS OF PROPERTY, HOMELESSNESS INFLICTING BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE MOST. A CRISIS OF HUNGER INFLICTING ONE IN A FIVE MOTHERS WHO HAVE CHILDREN'S WHO ARE HUNGRY, AND TRAGICALLY, MORE THAN A 165,000 LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT. MANY WITH LOVED ONES WHO NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. SIX YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DIFFERENT HEALTH CRISIS. IT WAS CALLED EBOLA, AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THEN? BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN DID THEIR JOBS. ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIE, TWO. THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED LEADERSHIP. COMPARE THAT TO THE MOMENT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW, WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE, TRUMP PUSHED MIRACLE CURES TO SELL ON FOX NEWS. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE FLATTENING THE CURVES, HE SAID THE VIRUS WOULD JUST, PROOF , POOF, GO AWAY LIKE A MIRACLE. WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN BACK OF HER BUSINESS, WHAT DID WE DO? WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN. THIS VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY, BUT THERE IS A REASON IT HAS HIT AMERICA WORSE THAN ANY OTHER ADVANCED NATION. IT IS BECAUSE OF TRUMPS , TRUMP'S FAILURE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE START. HIS REFUSAL TO GET TESTING UP AND RUNNING, AND FLIP-FLOPPING ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WEARING MASKS. IT IS DELUSIONAL BELIEF THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE EXPERTS. ALL OF THAT IS REASON, THE RECENT THAT AN AMERICAN DIES OF COVID-19 EVERY 80 SECONDS. IT IS WHY COUNTLESS BUSINESSES HAVE HAD TO SHUT THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IT IS WHY THERE IS COMPLETE CHAOS OVER WHEN AND HOW TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS ARE CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN AND ANGRY ABOUT CHILDCARE AND TO SAFETY OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL, WHETHER THEY WILL BE IN DANGER IF THEY GO OR FALL BEHIND IF THEY DO NOT. TRUMP IS ALSO THE REASON IT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE NOW UNEMPLOYED. HE INHERITED THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN HISTORY FROM BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN, AND THEN, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HE INHERITED, HE RAN IT STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND. BECAUSE OF TRUMPS FAILURES , TRUMP'S FAILURES OF LEADERSHIP, OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OUT OF ALL OF THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT HAS TRIPLED AS OF TODAY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ELECT THE GUY WHO JUST IS NOT UP FOR THE JOB. OUR COUNTRY ENDS UP IN TATTERS, AND SO DOES OUR REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DEFEATING DONALD TRUMP OR MIKE PENCE, IT IS ABOUT BUILDING THIS COUNTRY BACK BETTER. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH A CLEAN ENERGY RESOLUTION, BRING BRACK , BACK CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS. BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO EVERYONE HAS THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINALLY OFFERED CAREGIVERS THE DIGNITY, THE RESPECT, AND THE PAY THEY DESERVE. WE WILL PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY, WROTE OUT SYSTEMIC , ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PASS A JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL ENSURE EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE IS NOTHING NEW TO JOE. IT IS LIKE YOU GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE, WHY HE HELPED REAUTHORIZE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RESTORE UNEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWS. HE TAKES HIS PLACE IN THE ONGOING STORY OF AMERICA'S MARCH TOWARD EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AS THE ONLY, AS THE ONLY WAY SERVED ALONGSIDE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND HAS CHOSEN THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE. BUT AS JOE ALWAYS POINTS OUT, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. I WILL ADMIT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS WHERE I HAVE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WHENEVER I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR DOUBT, WHENEVER I HAVE HAD MY OWN DOUBTS, I THINK OF YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AND FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO ARE RISKING YOUR LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS, THE TRUCK DRIVERS AND WORKERS IN GROCERY STORES, IN FACTORIES, FARMS WORKING THERE, PUTTING YOUR OWN SAFETY ON THE LINE TO UP US GET THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, THE WOMEN AND STUDENTS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS , THE DREAMERS AND IMMIGRANTS WHO KNOW THAT FAMILIES BELONG TOGETHER, THE LGBTQ AMERICANS WHO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS LOVE, PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE AND COLOR AND GREAT YOU FINALLY DECLARING IN ONE VOICE, BLACK LIVES MATTER . ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY , THIS COUNTRY, A NEW GENERATION OF CHILDREN IS HEARING UP , GROWING UP HEARING THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE AND CHANTS OF HOPE ON WHICH I WAS RAISED, SOME STRAPPED INTO STROLLERS OF THEIR OWN. IT IS A SONG YOU WILL NEVER FORGET. TO EVERYONE KEEPING UP THE FIGHT, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING GREAT. YOU ARE THE HEROES OF OUR TIME, AND YOU ARE THE REASON. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR COUNTRY CLOSER TO REALIZING IT'S GREAT PROMISE. TO DO IT, WE WILL NEED TO WORK, ORGANIZE AND VOTE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED MORE THAN A VICTORY ON NOVEMBER 3. WE NEED A MANDATE THAT PROVES THE PAST FOUR YEARS ARE WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE. JOE LIKES TO SAY THAT CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT, AND IT IS TRUE. WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE THREE YEARS AGO TODAY, Q KNEW WE WERE IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. TOGETHER WITH YOUR HELP, IT IS A BATTLE WE WILL WIN. EARLIER THIS YEAR, I SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER JOE ASKED ME TO DO. NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO DO THE SAME. VISIT JOB, JOEBIDEN.COM. ELECTING JOE BIDEN IS JUST THE START OF THE WORK AHEAD OF US. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO BE BUT DECIDED RUNNING TO REPRESENT YOU, THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

[CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] [CAPTIONS COPYRIGHT NATIONAL CABLE SATELLITE CORP. 2020] GOOD AFTERNOON. ON THE EVE OF THE 57TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON, I WILL SPEAK ABOUT RECENT EVENTS IN KENOSHA, WISCONSIN, WILDFIRES RAGING ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA COAST TOMORROW , AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN. THE STORM WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH TEXAS, LOUISIANA, AND THE GULF COAST, AND MOST OF ALL, WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. WE ARE A NATION AT ITS BEST LOVES, PROTECTS, AND HELPS FELLOW AMERICANS. TODAY, WE SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION. WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTINUE FOLLOWING GUIDANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO STAY SAFE. JOE AND I PLEDGE TO BE THERE FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THOSE WHO NEED HELP FROM NEIGHBORS, STRANGERS, AND OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT THROUGH, TO RESTORE YOUR LIVES AND COMMUNITY. WE ALSO SEE PAIN, HURT, AND DESTRUCTION IN THE AFTERMATH OF YET ANOTHER BLACK MAN SHOT BY POLICE. JACOB BLAKE SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN THE BACK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. SEVEN TIMES, IN THE BACK, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AS VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN PUT IT, THE SHOTS FIRED AT MR. BLAKE PIERCED THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS SICKENING TO WATCH. IT IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT MUST END. THANKFULLY, HE IS ALIVE TODAY BUT HE IS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WHEN HE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILY AS THEY ENDURE THE ORDEAL THAT IS TRAGICALLY COMMON IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE AND I SPOKE WITH THEM YESTERDAY. THEY ARE AN AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, EVEN AS THEY SEEK JUSTICE FOR THEIR SON, THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE NEED TO END THE VIOLENCE AND HEAL OUR NATION. I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH FAR TOO MANY MOTHERS AND FATHERS. YOU WILL SEE AND HEAR NO ONE WITH MORE COURAGE, MORE CHARACTER, AND MORE MORAL CLARITY. PEOPLE ARE RIGHTFULLY ANGRY AND EXHAUSTED. AFTER THE MURDERS OF RIHANNA, AND SO MANY OTHERS, IT IS NO WONDER PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS. I SUPPORT THEM. WE MUST ALWAYS DEFEND PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THEM WITH LOOTING AND COMMITTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING THE SHOOTER, WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR MURDER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE WILL NOT LET VIGILANTES AND EXTREMISTS DERAIL THE PATH TO JUSTICE. HERE IS MY PROMISE TO THOSE MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND THOSE WHO STAND WITH THEM. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE, IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ALL GREW UP CITING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE BUT NOW, WE MUST GIVE REAL MEETING , MEANING TO HIS WORDS. ONE NATION, UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE, FOR ALL. JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THE LIFE OF A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS FULLY HUMAN. WE HAVE YET TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER TO PASS MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM AND BROADER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS SYSTEMIC RACISM. WE WILL ONLY COME CLOSER TO ACHIEVING THAT WHEN WE FINALLY COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARD BUILDING A PERFECT UNION BUT THE TIME IS NOW TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP FORWARD. EVEN AS THEY WE HAVE A RECKONING WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE, WE MUST ALSO CONFRONT ANOTHER CRISIS. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS TORN APART SO MANY LIVES. WE CANNOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR ALLOW OURSELVES TO SUCCUMB TO THEM. NEARLY 6 MILLION CONFIRMED CASES OF THE CORONAVIRUS. 180,000 LIVES LOST. MORE THAN 50 MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR ALONE. WE NEED TO SEE AND HEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. HOPING FOOD BANKS HAVE SOMETHING LEFT WHEN THEY GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE. THE 50-YEAR-OLD STORE MANAGER WHO HAS BEEN LAID OFF AND KNOWS HE CANNOT PAY THE RENT AND THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. MOTHERS AND FATHERS STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT, WORKING FROM HOME, WHILE HELPING THEIR KIDS WITH ONLINE CLASSES. TRYING TO HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER. ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SHUTTING THEIR DOORS EVERY DAY. THE NURSE, GETTING READY FOR HER AFTERNOON SHIFT, GIVEN SO MUCH SUFFERING AND DEATH IN RECENT MONTHS, WONDERS HOW MUCH MORE SHE COULD BEAR TO WITNESS. THE FAMILY GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THEIR MOTHER. COULD NOT EVEN VISIT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF HER LIFE. THE ALARMING AND DISPROPORTIONATE RATE AT WHICH BLACKS AND LATINOS AND INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE CONTRACTING AND DYING OF COVID-19. THAT IS THE REALITY NOW. A REALITY COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THIS WEEK'S REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR I'D ABOUT THE CHALLENGE WE WERE FACING AND HOW TO TACKLE THEM, THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SOOTH DONALD TRUMP'S EGO. TO MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. HERE'S THE THING. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HIM. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BY THAT MEASURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENCY. HE THINKS IT IS ABOUT HIM. IT IS NOT. IT IS ABOUT YOU. IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US. THE PEOPLE. I WOULD SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS. KAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY A STAND TODAY TO SPEAK FOR THE PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. DONALD TRUMP HAS FAILED AT THE MOST BASIC JOB OF THE UNITED STATES. HE FAILED TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. TRUMP SHOWED THAT WE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION WOULD CALL A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. A RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR THE DANGER A PANDEMIC WOULD PROPOSE FOR AMERICAN LIVES, FOR THE DEVASTATION IT WOULD DO TO OUR , TO OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE DAMAGE IT WOULD DO TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO STRUCTURAL RACISM FOR GENERATIONS. FOR THE CHAOS THAT WOULD UPEND OUR DAILY LIVES, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO GO TO SCHOOL. HE NEVER APPRECIATED A PRESIDENT SWEARS AN OATH BEFORE GOD AND COUNTRY TO PROTECT AMERICA AGAINST THREATS SEEN AND UNSEEN. IT IS HIS DUTY, IT IS HIS OBLIGATION TO PROTECT US. AND YET HE HAS FAILED, MISERABLY. HERE IS THE THING. DONALD TRUMP'S INCOMPETENCE IS NOTHING NEW. THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON FULL DISPLAY. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, IT BECAME DEADLY. THAT IS WHEN THE THREAT OF A VIRUS THAT WOULD ENDANGER THE WORLD FIRST EMERGED. TRUMP DISMISSED THE THREAT, BUT JOE BIDEN SOUNDS THE ALARM. IT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A PATTERN THAT PERSISTS TO THIS DAY. TRUMP TELLING US NOT TO WORRY, THAT THE VIRUS WILL DISAPPEAR, THAT A MIRACLE IS COMING. JOE BIDEN SAYING WE NEED A PLAN, IN NATIONAL STRATEGY, A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD , WILLING TO BE A ROLE MODEL FOR OUR NATION, FOR OUR CHILDREN. TRUMP STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN. JOE BIDEN RELEASED HIS FIRST PLAN IN MARCH. AND HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC. IT IS RELENTLESS. YOU CANNOT STOP IT WITH A TWEET. YOU CANNOT CREATE A DISTRACTION AND HOPE IT WILL GO AWAY. IT DOES NOT GO AWAY. BY ITS NATURE, IT PANDEMIC IS UNFORGIVING. IF YOU GET IT WRONG AT THE BEGINNING, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE CATASTROPHIC. IT IS VERY HARD TO CATCH UP AND YOU DO NOT GET A SECOND CHANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT IT WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING. THEN HE GOT IT WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. HERE IS WHY TRUMP HAS BEEN SO UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS. HE WAS ON FIXATING , FIXING THE PROBLEM. HE SAID IT WOULD HURT THE MARKET AND HURT HIS CHANCES OF BEING REELECTED. THAT MATTERED TO HIM MORE THAN SAVING AMERICAN LIVES. RIGHT AT THE MOMENT WE NEEDED DONALD TRUMP TO BE TOUGH ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, HE CAVED. ON JANUARY 24, HE PRAISED THE PIT , THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. HE SAID CHINA HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO DETAIN THE CORONAVIRUS. THE UNITED STATES GREATLY AND , APPRECIATES THEIR EFFORTS AND TRANSPARENCY AND IT WILL ALL END WELL. THEY BLOCKED PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS FROM OUR CDC INNING ACCESS AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES. DONALD TRUMP STOOD IDLY BY AND IT WAS A DEADLY DECISION. DONALD TRUMP FROZE. HE WAS SCARED. AND HE WAS PETTY AND FIGMENT IT , AND VINDICTIVE. HE TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT HIS JOB TO GIVE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO FRONTLINE WORKERS. HE SAYS, "RESPIRATORS, VENTILATORS, ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT, TRY GETTING IT YOURSELVES." ON THAT DAY WE HAVE , TODAY, WE HAVE NEARLY 6 MILLION. EVEN NOW, DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL NOT ACT. THE TRAGEDY IN ALL OF THIS IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. JUST LOOK AROUND. IT IS NOT LIKE THIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD. ALL WE NEEDED, GUYS, ALL WE NEEDED WAS A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. ONE WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN. WILLING TO LEAD. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, HAVE A PLAN. DO THEIR JOBS. JOE BIDEN WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. HE HAS GOT A NATIONAL STRATEGY. HE IS MORE THAN READY TO LEAD. EVERY MONTH SINCE MARCH, AS THE PANDEMIC HAS UNFOLDED, JOE BIDEN HAS UPDATED STEPS HE WOULD TAKE TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES AND HE HAS DONE IT BASED ON WHAT EVERY SCIENTIST, EXPERT, AND ECONOMIST SAYS WE SHOULD BE DOING. JOE BIDEN WILL PUT A PLAN INTO EFFECT ON DAY ONE, DEPLOY RAPID TESTS WITH IMMEDIATE RESULTS, MAKE SURE TREATMENTS AND ULTIMATELY, A VACCINE, REACH ALL AMERICANS, INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, WHICH HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LEFT BEHIND. MANUFACTURER THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED AND MAKE THEM RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA SO WE ARE NEVER AGAIN AT THE MERCY OF CHINA AND OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. JOE AND I WILL MAKE SURE SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE OPEN AND SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND NOT SILENCE THE EXPERTS SO PUBLIC GETS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED AND DESERVE. AND PUT IN PLACE A NATIONWIDE MASK MANDATE. IT IS NOT A BURDEN TO PROTECT EACH OTHER. HE SAYS THAT BECAUSE THE THING ABOUT JOE IS, HE KNOWS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT ALL OF THIS DEATH. BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN HAD A PROGRAM CALLED PROTECT. THE PROGRAM TRACKED EMERGING DISEASES IN PLACES LIKE CHINA. TRUMP CUT IT. THEY CREATED THAT TEAM IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, DEDICATING THEM TO THE WORK IN BIO DEFENSE. THEY IMPLEMENTED STANZEL , STANDARDS TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL. DONALD TRUMP IS ERASING THEM. BEFORE THE VIRUS HIT, TRUMP MADE US VULNERABLE. HE FAILED TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AS IT CONTINUES, HE IS MAKING IT WORSE EVERY DAY. JUST THIS WEEK, THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION SAID A CUT TO SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THE ONE TRUMP IS PROPOSING WOULD END DISABILITY BENEFITS WITHIN ONE YEAR. AND ALL BENEFITS WITHIN THREE YEARS. LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. IF DONALD TRUMP'S EXTREME PROPOSAL GOES INTO EFFECT, THE CHECKS THAT AMERICAN SENIORS ARE RELYING ON, THAT YOU RELY ON, TO PAY YOUR BILLS, TO BUYER MEDICINE, TO LIVE, WILL STOP COMING. THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY IN THIS CRISIS, IT IS UNTHINKABLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEALTH CRISIS MADE WORSE BY HIS OWN ACTIONS, DONALD TRUMP IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO THROW OUT THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, INCLUDING PROTECTIONS IT PROVIDES FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THAT MEANS IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SURVIVE COVID-19, INSURERS COULD DENY YOU COVERAGE FOR TREATING ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL NOT TELL YOU ANY OF THIS AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION TONIGHT. WE ALL KNOW HE IS NOT CHANGING. THE PRESIDENT HE HAS BEEN IS THE PRESIDENT HE WILL BE. WE HAVE A CHANCE TO RIGHT THESE WRONGS AND PUT AMERICA ON A BETTER PATH FORWARD. LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS AND FOLLOW THE BEST MEDICAL GUIDANCE TO KEEP US AND KEEP FAMILIES SAFE. ONE WHERE WE TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST SYSTEMS AND TRADITIONS OF OPPRESSION. ONE WHERE WE STOP FANNING THE FLAMES OF HATE AND DIVISION AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT EACH ONE OF US DESERVES. AS JOE BIDEN SAID, WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK. I BELIEVE AMERICA WILL CHOOSE THE LIGHT. THANK YOU.

SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION WOULD ADDRESS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND RACIAL AND UNREST. WE'VE HAD THIS MONUMENT IS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH OUR BELOVED SENATOR, SOON TO BE VICE PRESIDENT. AND, REALLY SPEAKING ABOUT HOW WE STAND ON THIS PRECIPICE OF OPPORTUNITY AND CHANGE IT FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL BE IMPACTFUL FOR OUR NATION. HOW DO WE RALLY THOSE BEFORE US? WE HAVE GREAT CONVERSATION. NOW WE WILL MOVE INTO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. I'M JOANNE. MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 1945. MY WORK IN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP A PATHWAY TO THE ECONOMY FOR OUR NEIGHBORS, TO REALLY RELY ON OUR NEIGHBORS KNOWLEDGE AND ASSETS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITIES WE ALL DESIRE TO LIVE IN. I'M GOING TO ALLOW US TO ENJOY AND CONTINUE THE WORK FOR WISCONSIN NEEDS THE ENERGY. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT ALL THAT WE ARE, THAT WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH, NOW , I TALKED ABOUT THE SUNRISE. YOU DON'T SEE THE SUN, IT IS STILL THERE. WE ARE NOW LEADING INTO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO HEAR US AND PROVIDE AN ACTIONABLE PLATFORM WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD WITH. I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS MOMENT. I'M THANKFUL FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO BE IN YOUR PRESENCE. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK ALL THESE LEADERS. I WANT TO START WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE WORK YOU HAVE BEEN DOING DURING THESE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES AROUND THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING HERE IN WISCONSIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS GROUP OF BUSINESS LEADERS TOGETHER THIS AFTERNOON. WE'VE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. IT IS ACTUALLY A DISCUSSION THAT CONTINUES , A DISCUSSION I'VE BEEN HAVING THROUGHOUT MY VISITS TODAY IN MILWAUKEE. IT IS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF WORK. AND THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LEADERSHIP TO TAP INTO THAT DIGNITY IN A WAY THAT WE GROW CAPACITY. THAT'S ABOUT CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, CAPACITY OF COMMUNITY, AND ULTIMATELY ABOUT GROWING THE CAPACITY OF OUR COUNTRY TO BE STRONG AND TO BE HEALTHY. WE HAVE HAD AN EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SAFE COMMUNITIES, WE MUST INVEST IN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS THAT THERE IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE HEARTBEAT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES, THAT ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS IS, THEY ARE NOT ONLY LEADERS IN BUSINESS, THEY ARE CIVIC LEADERS. THEY HIRE LOCALLY, THEY UNDERSTAND THE JEWELS THAT EXIST WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THE NEED TO THEN ENCOURAGE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED, INCLUDING POINTING OUT THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC, COVID, IT HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR IN MANY WAYS. ONE WAY WE TALKED ABOUT IN PARTICULAR IS HIGHLIGHTING THE DISPARITIES IN TECHNOLOGY BASED ON RACE. THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY. THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT FAMILIES NOW ARE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL VIRTUALLY, AND WHETHER THAT FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND, WHETHER THAT FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TECHNOLOGY WORKS, THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE CAPACITY OF THE CHILDREN OF THAT FAMILY TO ACTUALLY SURVIVE THROUGH THIS MOMENT, MUCH LESS THRIVE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS, MEANING HAVING OUR GOVERNMENT, AS OUR PRIORITY, IT IS PART OF JOE BIDEN AND MY PRIORITY, INVESTING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INVESTING NOT ONLY THROUGH THE WORK WE WILL DO THAT IS ABOUT ACCESS TO CAPITAL THROUGH SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, ACCESS TO CAPITAL, PUTTING MONEY INTO OPPORTUNITY ZONES IS ONE PART OF IT BUT $150 BILLION IN NEW CAPITAL IN OPPORTUNITIES AROUND INVESTING IN PRIVATE VENTURE CAPITAL AS WELL AS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO. THIS IS ABOUT AN INVESTMENT IN NOT ONLY THOSE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES, BUT IN OUR COUNTRY, UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST SOURCES OF WEALTH, INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH, COME ABOUT THROUGH THAT KIND OF FOCUS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY BANKS. DURING THE COURSE OF THIS CRISIS, UP TO 90% OF MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PPP. IN LARGE PART, BECAUSE UNLIKE HOW DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE WEALTHY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING EVERY DAY AND TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THOSE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF SOMETHING LIKE THE PPP. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE TAX CREDITS PERMANENT AND DOING THAT, THROUGH DOING THAT, INCREASING FUNDING TO AS MUCH AS $5 BILLION ANNUALLY PROVIDE CREDIT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN SMALL BUSINESSES THAT BENEFIT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME AREAS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD THIS AFTERNOON. IT IS ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF A PLEDGE THAT JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF ARE MAKING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING HERE IN MILWAUKEE, THAT WE SEE YOU, WE UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT YOU ARE IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF COMMUNITIES, AND WE SEE THE BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO INVEST IN OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS. SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE THANKFUL FOR THIS, FOR THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO TOOK TIME OUT OF YOUR DAYS. TODAY IS LABOR DAY, OF COURSE. SO, PART OF THE WORK WE HAVE BEEN DOING TODAY IS TO HONOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LABOR, INCLUDING, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THE PRIDE MILWAUKEE AND MANY OF US HAVE IN ORGANIZED LABOR. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND WHAT WE MUST DO TO ALWAYS SUPPORT THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN, TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND HAVE ALL OF THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT COME WITH A HARD DAY'S WORK AND THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DIGNITY OF WORK. WITH THAT, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I WILL PASS THE MICROPHONE TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS IS THE SENATOR'S VERY FIRST TRIP SO WE ARE EXCITED THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW CRUCIAL WISCONSIN AND MILWAUKEE WILL BE IN THE ELECTION. IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO HAVE LEADERS THAT CARE, WHO WILL SHOW UP AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY WITH SO MANY BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS HERE AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT WITH THE WHITE HOUSE'S RECENT DECISION TO CANCEL ALL TRADES RELATED TO RACE, THAT IS UNFORTUNATE AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE MANY DISPARITIES IN MILWAUKEE AND WISCONSIN AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE DONALD TRUMP WON'T RESPOND TO THAT CRISIS. WE ARE PROUD AND LUCKY TO HAVE SENATOR, SOON TO BE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WITH US TODAY. I WILL PASS IT BACK TO YOU.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475502-1/vice-presidential-nominee-kamala-harris-campaign-event-milwaukee	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, took part in a Labor Day roundtable discussion with Black business owners.

YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN, YOUR UNFILTERED VIEW OF GOVERNMENT. CREATED BY AMERICA'S CABLE TELEVISION COMPANY AS A PUBLIC SERVICE, AND BROUGHT TO YOU TODAY BY YOUR TELEVISION PROVIDER. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, PARTICIPATED IN A CONVERSATION WITH LATINO LEADERS IN PHILADELPHIA. AFTERWARDS, SHE SHARED THE TOPICS DISCUSSED, INCLUDING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TREATMENT OF PUERTO RICO FOLLOWING HURRICANE MARIA IN 2017. SO I HEAR THIS AFTERNOON WAS COMMUNITY LEADERS, NATIONAL LEADERS, A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY THINGS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF PUERTO RICO, THE STATE OF AFFAIRS OF PUERTO RICO, AND WHAT A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO DOING TO INVEST IN THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO. AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES PEOPLE'S VOICES MUST BE HEARD AND RESPECTED. A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO GOING TO BE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES AND THE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND EXASPERATED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL BE OUR INTENTION AS AN ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES IN A WAY THAT'S MORE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WE SAY WE ARE, WHICH IS A DEMOCRACY THAT'S COMMITTED TO EQUALITY AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. SO THE CONVERSATION WE HAD RANGED FROM THAT, TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE CULTURE AND THE ARTS. SO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING WE ARE IN, AND A COMMITMENT THAT A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE TWO THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT OF THE ARTS, AND SUPPORTING CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THIS ONE, THAT GIVE SUPPORT TO THE YOUTH OF THE COMMUNITY, UNDERSTANDING THEIR CAPACITY, AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR POTENTIAL WHEN WE INVEST IN THEIR ABILITY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND HIGHLIGHT THE CULTURES FROM WHICH THEY COME. SO THE CONVERSATION ALSO WAS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF, THE LINGERING, HAVING GONE AWAY, EFFECTS OF HURRICANE MARIA. COMPOUNDED NOW WITH COVID, AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT FOR THE ISLAND, IN TERMS OF THE ISLAND IMPACT AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. FRANKLY, THE SUFFERING THAT IS TAKING PLACE THERE. IT IS ALSO INEXCUSABLE THE WAY THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HAS TREATED PUERTO RICO. WE REMEMBER WHEN HE WENT AFTER THE HURRICANE AND THREW PAPER TOWELS AT PEOPLE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DENIED THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO THE DIGNITY THEY DESERVE. IT HAS DENIED THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. IT HAS BEEN AN ADMINISTRATION THAT DENIED THE PEOPLE OF ORDER RICO TH , PUERTO RICO THE POWER THEY DESERVE TO HAVE, IN TERMS OF THEIR VOICE AND THE WAY THAT THEY LIVE, THE WAY THAT THEIR CHILDREN LIVE AND WILL LIVE GOING FORWARD. IN A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, WE INTENT TO RESPECT THEIR VOICE, CULTURE, AND HISTORY. I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERS WHO WERE HERE FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE, AND OUR CONVERSATION AS ONE OF MANY ONGOING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?475750-1/senator-kamala-harris-visit-philadelphia	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, participated in a conversation with Latino leaders in Philadelphia.

AND WITH ALL OF OUR HELP, SHE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I'VE WORKED WITH SENATOR HARRIS AS A COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE, AND AS A FRIEND. AND I KNOW, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, THAT SHE'S GOING TO MAKE US PROUD. AND BY THE WAY, SO IS HER PARTNER AND ANOTHER LONG TERM FRIEND OF MINE, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] TODAY WE'RE GRIEVING THE LOSS OF THE ULTIMATE LIFELONG EXAMPLE OF THE WORDS "TOUGH," "SMART," "COURAGEOUS," AND DOING THE RIGHT THING. AN INCREDIBLE HERO FOR MILLIONS OF US, OUR BELOVED RBG. JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. WITH THE TRAGEDY OF HER PASSING, IT'S NOW UP TO US, IT IS UP TO US, TO EMBODY HER SAME COURAGE AND HER SAME DETERMINATION. TO FIGHT FOR WHAT'S RIGHT AND JUST FOR ALL AMERICANS. WITH THIS NEW SUPREME COURT VACANCY, EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE, WE KNOW THAT. ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS, CIVIL RIGHTS, OUR WAY OF LIFE, AND WITH THIS ELECTION TOO, IT'S ALL ON THE LINE, INCLUDING WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS, AND FRANKLY WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT'S LITERALLY TRUE. IT'S EASY TO BE DEPRESSED RIGHT NOW, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS IS NOT A TIME TO AGONIZE, OR GIVE UP. IT'S A TIME TO ORGANIZE AND STAND UP. NOT AGONIZE, ORGANIZE. NOT GIVE UP, BUT STAND UP. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. THIS IS OUR TIME TO REGISTER AND VOTE. THIS IS OUR TIME TO SAY, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

THIS ELECTION IS OUR TIME TO VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WHO WILL HAVE HEALED THE SOUL OF AMERICA AND BUILD BACK BETTER.

DO THAT, DO THAT, AND WE WILL KNOW THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE OUR BACK. THIS IS OUR TIME, MICHIGAN. LET'S VOTE. TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [APPLAUSE] (music) WELCOME TO DETROIT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE MAYOR OF DETROIT WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT. IN MARCH, WHEN WE GOT HAMMERED WITH COVID, WE WERE LOSING 50 PEOPLE A DAY. WE NEEDED TEST KITS TO TEST THE FOLKS AT NURSING HOMES TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES WERE SICK AND WHY THEY WERE DYING. WHEN THE HOSPITAL WORKERS AND NURSES NEEDED GOWNS AND MASKS BECAUSE THEY WERE GETTING SICK AND DYING, WHEN PEOPLE WERE PACKED ON GURNEYS IN THE HALLWAY. WE TURNS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR HELP AND LEADERSHIP, AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID? I'M NOT A SHIPPING CLERK. IT IS NOT MY JOB. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT IN 2009, WHEN GM AND FCA WERE ABOUT TO CLOSE DOWN IN BANKRUPTCY AND IF BARACK OBAMA HAD SAID, IT'S NOT MY JOB. WE WOULD NOT HAVE 5000 JOBS AT THE FCA PLANT COMING DOWN THE STREET, 2000 MORE JOBS IF THE GM , AT THE GM PLANT WITH THE NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND TRUCKS. WHEN WE WERE IN BANKRUPTCY AND JOE BIDEN WAS HERE OVER AND OVER, AND WHEN I SHOWED HIM THAT A THIRD OF THE BUSES IN THE CITY WERE BROKEN DOWN, PEOPLE COULDN'T GET TO WORK, HE DIDN'T SAY, IT'S NOT MY JOB. HE CAME FORTH WITH A PLAN THAT GOT US THOSE BUSES AND HE CAME OUT HIMSELF TO SEE THEM DELIVERED. THAT'S HOW MUCH HE CARED ABOUT US. WHEN I SAID TO HIM, WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK BUT SO MANY OF OUR TALENTED WORKERS ARE BEING HELD BACK BY A CRIMINAL CONVICTION, WE HAVE TO GIVE FOLKS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME A SECOND CHANCE, HE, ALONG WITH LABOR SECRETARY TOM PEREZ, GOT US A GRANT. WE WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE DETROIT DETENTION CENTER AND FOLKS WHO ARE ABOUT TO PUT FINISH THEIR PRISON SENTENCES, WE TRAINED THEM TO BE FORKLIFT OPERATORS AND COOKS IN RESTAURANTS, AND WE LITERALLY TOOK THEM WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF PRISON ON FRIDAY INTO A JOB ON MONDAY BECAUSE JOE BIDEN CARES. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM A SENATOR WHO IS NOT FROM DETROIT BUT HAS DETROIT IN HER HEART. WHEN SHE WAS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO, SHE STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED BACK ON TRACK TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED AND GIVE THEM A PATH RIGHT BACK INTO THE WORKPLACE TO SAY, YOU HAVE THAT SECOND CHANCE. SHE DID NOT DO THIS WHEN IT WAS POLITICALLY POPULAR. SHE DID IT IN 2004. BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND SO IN 42 DAYS WE GET A CHANCE TO CHANGE THIS, AND GET AN ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON THAT IS ON DETROIT'S SIDE. SO PLEASE, VOTE EARLY. I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS ABOUT TO DO IT SHORTLY. REQUEST YOUR BALLOTS. DETROIT, I BELIEVE, IS GOING TO DECIDE THE ELECTION IN MICHIGAN. WE ARE GOING TO TURN OUT BIG. LET'S ALL GET OUT AND WORK. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, EVERYONE. I AM SO GLAD TO SEE WELL HERE. , SEE YOU ALL HERE. I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT BEING THE PLACEHOLDERS FOR ABOUT 10,000 MORE OF YOU AROUND MICHIGAN. BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS TO WIN THIS. YOU ARE HERE TODAY TO WITNESS OUR TEAM, OUR EFFORTS, AND ALL THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY RECEIVE THE LEADERSHIP THAT OUR DEMOCRACY HAS OUTLINED. IN DETROIT, WE ARE TOUGH. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT US ALL THE TIME AND SAY WE DON'T TAKE NO MESS. WE IN CONGRESS, WHEN I GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AN ISSUE, THEY SAY, YOU KNOW SHE IS FROM DETROIT. BUT WE HAVE SUCH A REPUTATION. WE ARE THE COMEBACK KID. WE ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. AND THEN WE SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, WE HAVE MORE TO COME. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME TO DETROIT AN AMAZING WOMAN, A WOMAN THAT IS OUR KIND OF PEOPLE. SHE IS A FIGHTER. SHE IS A PERSON WHO HAS NOT GIVEN UP. SHE IS A PERSON WHO HAS COMPASSION. AND I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME A POLITICIAN WITHOUT PASSION IS A CRIMINAL. WE ARE SEEING THAT BEING PLAYED OUT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES RIGHT NOW. WE KNOW WE HER COMPASSION, HER ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, HER INTELLIGENCE, HER ABILITY TO COMPREHEND THE MOVEMENT, THE PROCESS OF LAW. WE KNOW THAT SHE RESPECTS DIVERSITY. SHE HAS PRODUCED MY DIVERSITY THE AMERICAN DREAM. SHE BRINGS TO THE TABLE THINGS WE OFTEN WISH WE HAD RIGHT NOW IN THIS ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, MICHIGAN. WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO LAST TIME. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. THE BALL IS IN OUR COURT. SO, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I GRIEVED WHEN JOHN LEWIS DIED. BUT JOHN LEWIS SAID KEEP FIGHTING, DON'T GIVE UP. SO, INSTEAD OF US GRIEVING, THE WAY WE FIGHT IS WITH OUR VOTE. WE LOST AN AMAZING WOMAN IN THE NOTORIOUS RBG. BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT US TO GRIEVE. SHE WANTED US TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT. SO WE, WHEN WE LOOK AT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CRIMINAL REFORM AND LOOK AT THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN SHED, THE TEARS WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. BUT VOTING WILL. WE HAVE TO VOTE BECAUSE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW, WITH ALL OF THE SPIRIT AND THE HARDSHIPS AND THE SUCCESS AND ALL OF THE INVESTMENT THAT HAS BEEN PLACED IN ME BY THE LITTLE BLACK GIRL FROM THE EAST SIDE OF DETROIT, GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL, KNOWING WHAT IT MEANS TO COME FROM NOTHING AND WORK YOUR WAY THERE, I STAND HERE WITH A VOICE OF DETROIT TO WELCOME OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PLEASE RISE TO YOUR FEET AS WE WELCOME SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS! (music) IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE WITH YOU GUYS. I LOVE DETROIT. GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO EVERY DAY FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. YOU AND I HAVE SPENT TIME, MANY VISITS HERE IN DETROIT TOGETHER OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LONG TIME WE HAVE BEEN DOING WHAT WE DO. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALWAYS RISING, ESPECIALLY IN THESE MOMENTS OF CRISIS, TO BE A VOICE FOR THE PEOPLE. SENATOR DEBBIE STABENOW, YOU ARE MY SISTER IN THE SENATE. YOU ARE MY FRIEND. YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE LEADER NOT ONLY IN MICHIGAN, BUT NATIONALLY. AND YES, WE HAVE TO REELECT GARY PETERS TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE! GARY IS MY SEAT MATE IN THE SENATE. I CAN TELL YOU, WE SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER, SO ALL THOSE HEARINGS THAT YOU SEE ON TV AND ALL OF THE INTERACTIONS WE HAVE ON A DAILY BASIS IN THE SENATE, GARY ALWAYS LEANS OVER TO ME, TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT WORKING PEOPLE. WHO IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE PAID FOR THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK? HE TALKS ABOUT THE YOUTH AND THE CHILDREN AND THE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A VITAL PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. HE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED TO GROW THE ECONOMY. SO PLEASE, DETROIT AND MICHIGAN, SEND GARY PETERS BACK TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. [APPLAUSE] SENATE. APPLAUSE FISH APPLAUSE FISH MAYOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WARM WELCOME AND THE WORK YOU DO EVERY DAY. I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING BACK ON TRACK, I KNOW YOU DID THE SAME TYPE OF WORK IN DETROIT.

I HAVE WATCHED YOU ON TV. [LAUGHTER] I AM SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. AND ALWAYS, YOU HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL VOICES AND KNOW THE STRENGTH OF YOUR VOICES ALWAYS. WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE SINGING. YOUR VOICES ARE SO POWERFUL, AND YOURS ARE THE VOICES OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FUTURE, AND ALWAYS USE THEM IN A WAY THAT OWNS THE POWER THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU FOR GRACING ME THIS EVENING WITH YOUR PRESENCE. DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR. [APPLAUSE] I AM IN MICHIGAN, AGAIN. LEFT HER [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE I LOVE BEING IN MICHIGAN AND YOU KNOW, DETROIT, IT REMINDS ME OF MY HOMETOWN OF OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, SO MUCH. THERE IS SO MUCH HERE, SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME FROM DETROIT, SO MANY WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER AND THE LEADERSHIP OF WHO WE ARE. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS ABOUT DETROIT THAT IS NOT ONLY A MEASURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT'S EXCELLENCE BUT ALSO AS A MEASURE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A NATION. AND SO JOE AND I FEEL A PARTICULAR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO BE HERE AND TO BE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN WAS HERE LAST , WEEK, WE WILL KEEP COMING BACK. BECAUSE SO GOES MICHIGAN GOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED. AND WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN MICHIGAN, AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN 130 CASES OF CODED WHEN I KNOW THAT WE HAVE , MOURNED THE LOSS OF OVER 7000 PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. I LOOK AT THAT AND WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS DONE TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS, WHAT IT HAS DONE TO PUT US IN A PLACE WHERE COLLECTIVELY WE ARE MOURNING AND GRIEVING THE LOSS OF LIFE. THE LOSS OF JOBS. THE LOSS OF NORMALCY. THE LOSS OF CONSISTENCY. AND WE HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP IN 42 DAYS AND MICHIGAN WILL BE VOTING IN 48 HOURS. ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL CHART THE COURSE OF THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY IN A VERY DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE WAY. AND SO I REFERENCE THE PANDEMIC AS TESTAMENT TO THAT POINT. WE HAVE A CHOICE ON ONE HAND OF THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO, AS WE NOW KNOW NOT BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD US ABOUT A CONVERSATION THEY HAD WITH HIM, BUT BECAUSE BOB WOODWARD RECORDED THE CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP, WHEN IN EARLY FEBRUARY IT BECAME CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD BEEN BRIEFED IN JANUARY AND TALKED IN FEBRUARY ABOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE, HIS KNOWLEDGE, THAT THIS VIRUS COULD KILL HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT IT IS AIRBORNE. HE UNDERSTOOD IT SO WELL HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CATCHING SOMETHING IN THE AIR AND CATCHING SOMETHING ON THE SURFACE. JOE BIDEN WAS FUNNY, HE SAID, AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW THE GUY CAN READ. CLEARLY, HE GOT A BRIEFING. BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVING MISSED KNOWLEDGE, , HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE, ALSO POSSESSING THE TITLE AND MY DUTY TO BE THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THEREBY HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCERN HIMSELF AS A FIRST PRIORITY AND WITH THE SAFETY AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, HE WENT ON TO CALL THIS VIRUS A HOAX. WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD DISMISS WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WERE TELLING US. TO THIS DAY, WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW THE MARKER, THE SAD, AWFUL MARKER OF 200,000 LIVES THAT HAVE PERISHED IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. ALMOST 7 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS. AND TO THIS DAY, WE HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO IS HOLDING RALLIES WITH NO MASK BECAUSE YOU SEE HE HAS CONVINCED EVERYONE, THAT YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK AND YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T. MAKING VALUE JUDGMENTS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH NOT DYING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE DESERVE BETTER. [APPLAUSE] WE DESERVE AT HER. WE DESERVE BETTER. AND HERE'S THE OTHER THING, YOU COUPLE THAT WHICH IS ENOUGH, WITH THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BOY BILL BARR ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC POLICY REFORMS IN MODERN HISTORY. CREATED BY BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, AND IT IS CALLED THE "AFFORDABLE CARE ACT." THE "AFFORDABLE CARE ACT," ALSO KNOWN AS "OBAMACARE." WHAT DID IT DO? IT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE AND COVERAGE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. IT SAID, IT'S NOT RIGHT TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, LIKE DIABETES, LIKE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FROM HAVING COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SAID, YOU CAN NO LONGER BAN OR PROHIBIT SOMEONE WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION FROM HAVING THAT KIND OF ACCESS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH RECOGNIZED THAT SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG LEADERS MIGHT GO INTO A JOB WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL, THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, EVEN THOUGH THEY NEED IT. SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON SO LET'S ALLOW THEM TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS' COVERAGE UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID ALL OF THAT, AND YET, IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS IN COURT, TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. CHECK THAT OUT. IN THE MIDST OF A MOMENT THAT REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAVELY SICK HAVE MEDICAL CARE. AND ACCESS TO CARE, WITHOUT BEING BURDENED WITH WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD IT, HE IS IN COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. AND THE DETAILS ON THIS MATTER, BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS HE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT LET'S PUT IT IN , THE CONTEXT OF IF HE WINS. IF HE WINS THE ELECTION, AND IF HE WINS THE CASE, IF HE WINS THE CASE, THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AN AMERICA WHEREIN AT LEAST US OF TODAY, 7 MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE, IN ADDITION TO THOSE FROM BEFORE, A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND THAT IS CALLED THEY CONTRACTED THE COVID VIRUS. WHERE PHYSICIANS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE ARE THINGS LIKE LUNG-SCARRING THAT MAY COME FROM THAT, OTHER UNKNOWN LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE IF HE WINS THIS ELECTION, WINS BEST THAT CASE, IN ADDITION TO OUR PARENTS, OUR GRANDPARENTS, OUR NEIGHBORS AND , THE PEOPLE WE LOVE WHO MAY HAVE DIABETES, WHO MAY HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, THE PEOPLE WE KNOW WHO MAY HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND THANK GOD THEY'VE LIVED , MAY BE DENIED COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE AT PLAY IN THIS ELECTION. SO I AM HERE IN DETROIT ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AT MYSELF. TO HONOR THE FACT THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WILL HAVE A GRAVE CONSEQUENCE AND IMPACT TO THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AND THE CITY OF DETROIT. AND AS A MESSENGER OF THESE POINTS, I WANTED TO BE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I BELIEVE WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR VOTE, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT A PATH TOWARDS VICTORY IN THIS ELECTION RUNS STRAIGHT THROUGH MICHIGAN. SO I AM HERE TO SPEAK WITH YOU , BECAUSE YOU POSSESS AN ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION IN THIS ELECTION THAT COULD IMPACT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I'M HERE TO ALSO REMIND US, THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE , THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN THE WAY OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. YOU CAN LOOK AT HISTORY, WE KNOW THAT. WE KNOW WHY JOHN LEWIS SHED HIS GOD ON THE EDMUND , SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE JUST CELEBRATED WEEKS AGO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. BECAUSE THOSE SUFFRAGETTES FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN TO VOTE. BUT NOTE, WHICH IS MORE THAN A FOOTNOTE, BLACK WOMEN COULDN'T VOTE UNTIL 1965. WE KNOW THAT HISTORY, WE KNOW THE HISTORY THAT IN 2013, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. WHEREIN, ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PUT IN PLACE LAWS TO TRY AND SUPPRESS, OR PREVENT BLOCK PEOPLE FROM VOTING. STUDENTS FROM VOTING, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FROM VOTING. THE EFFORT WAS SO OBVIOUS, THAT AS AN EXAMPLE, IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE COURT OF APPEAL WHEN THEY REVIEWED WHAT THAT STATE DID, SAID THAT THE STATE DID IT WITH, QUOTE, "SURGICAL PRECISION" TO PREVENT BLACK FOLKS FROM VOTING. 2013, SHALL BE THE HOLDER , SHELBY V. HOLDER, THAT CASE. 2016, I SERVED ON THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD. RUSSIA INTERFERED IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WITH A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN, WITH AN INTENT TO CAUSE THE AMERICAN PAPER TO DISTRUST ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PILLARS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHICH IS OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. AND BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE BEING TOLD, THAT THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. SO DETROIT, I THINK ALL OF THIS BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TO PREVENT US FROM VOTING? WHY ARE THEY GOING THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? AND THE ANSWER IS, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. [APPLAUSE] SO LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET US NOT LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER, THAT IS THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THROUGH OUR VOTE, FROM US. WE MUST VOTE, AND WE MUST VOTE EARLY. IN 48 HOURS, YOU CAN START VOTING HERE IN MICHIGAN. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU VOTE EARLY YOU CAN REMIND FOLKS ALSO , THAT THEY HAVE 40 DAYS TO VOTE. WE'RE ASKING FOLKS TO MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, LIKE PULL OUT YOUR CALENDAR AND MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE THAT THAT IS THE DAY YOU'RE , GOING TO VOTE. YOU CAN EVEN HAVE A CEREMONY ABOUT IT, HAVE A PARTY ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT. BUT LET'S MAKE A PLAN TO VOTE, BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. ON SO MANY ISSUES, AND YOU HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. TO VOTE JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO WILL RESTORE THE DIGNITY, THE STANDING, AND THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK AT US, EACH ONE OF US, THEY WILL LOOK IN HER EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM, IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT, WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THE PISTONS' BACKYARD, WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT WITH THE DETROIT YOUTH CHOIR AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATOR AND THE MAYOR. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE WERE COMMITTED OVER THOSE 42 DAYS TO DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKING SURE WE VOTE AND EVERYONE WE KNOW VOTES AND IN THAT WAY, FIGHTS FOR THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE. THANK YOU, DETROIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

CSPANKH289202022	Kamala Harris	2020-09-28	Senator Kamala Harris Remarks on the Supreme Court	SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER YESTERDAY GOING RIGHT IT HEALTH CARE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS NOMINATION. EXPECT TO HEAR MORE OF THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS. THIS IS THE HEADLINE FROM A VETERAN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER IN THE WASHINGTON POST. "DEMOCRATS PLAN TO MAKE THE SUPREME COURT FIGHT ABOUT SAVING THE ACA." DEMOCRATS HAVE AN OBVIOUS HYPOCRISY ARGUMENT THEY CAN MAKE AGAINST MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL , GOOD AFTERNOON. ON FRIDAY MORNING, I ATTENDED THE MEMORIAL SERVICE OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN IN OUR HISTORY TO LIE IN STATE. I SAT A FEW FEET AWAY FROM HER FLAG DRAPED CASKET TO PAY MY RESPECTS. IT WAS SOMBER AND IT WAS PERSONAL. AND IT WAS AN EXTRA ORDINARY MOMENT FOR ME, AS I AM SURE IT WAS FOR YOU AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO FELT A CONNECTION WITH THE GREAT ARE BG , RBG. IT WAS SAD BECAUSE WE LOST A GIANT NOT ONLY OF THE COURT BUT OF AMERICAN LIFE. IT WAS A CELEBRATION. FEW PEOPLE IN OUR HISTORY HAVE DONE MORE TO CHANGE THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAN RUTH BADER GINSBURG DID AS A LAWYER, ADVOCATE, AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND IT WAS AN INSPIRATION AND A CALL TO EACH OF US, FOR EACH OF US TO BE BETTER, TO STAY IN THE FIGHT, AND STAY COMMITTED TO WHAT MOTIVATED JUSTICE GINSBURG THE MOST, THAT PHRASE ETCHED IN THE MARBLE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT "EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW." JUSTICE GINSBURG CAME TO HER VIEW OF THE LAW NOT FROM A TEXTBOOK BUT FROM LIFE. HER OWN LIFE. SHE OFTEN TOLD THE STORY OF HOW SHE HAD PERSONALLY FELT THE STING OF DISCRIMINATION AS A WOMAN, AS THE MOTHER OF A YOUNG CHILD TRYING TO FIND WORK, AND SO SHE COMMITTED HER LIFE STEP-BY-STEP, CASE-BY-CASE, LAW BY LAW, TO TEAR DOWN THE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF SO MANY, AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN. NOW, WE ARE ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE THE TASK OF FINDING HER REPLACEMENT ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. OF COURSE, IT IS HARD TO SAY THOSE WORDS. IN TRUTH, RUTH BADER GINSBURG CANNOT BE REPLACED. SHE WAS AND ORIGINAL, A ONE-OF-A-KIND , SHE WAS AN ORIGINAL, A ONE-OF-A-KIND. SHE COMBINED A STEEL SPINE WITH AN ABILITY TO EXTEND AN OPEN HAND, NEVER A CLOSED FIST. SHE DEMONSTRATED YOU COULD BOTH HOLD FIRM TO YOUR PRINCIPLES AND STILL HEAR THOSE WITH WHOM YOU DISAGREE. THAT IS A LESSON THAT SHOULD BE RINGING IN OUR EARS, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING ANY OF THE LESSONS FROM JUSTICE GINSBURG. ALREADY, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY HAVE CHOSEN TO IGNORE JUSTICE GINSBURG'S FINAL WISH TO HOLD OFF THE NOMINATION TO REPLACE HER UNTIL AFTER THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS CHOSEN. I WISH, BY THE WAY, SHARED BY , A WISH, BY THE WAY, SHARED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND, LOOK, IT IS NOT COMPLICATED. THE VOTERS WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THEIR PRESIDENT BEFORE THE SENATE VOTES ON A NOMINEE. AND THAT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. IN FACT, MY SENSE IS THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE TOLD. WE ARE NOT EVEN DEBATING , THIS IS IMPORTANT , WE ARE NOT EVEN DEBATING WHETHER THE SENATE SHOULD HOLD HEARINGS ON A NOMINEE IN AN ELECTION YEAR. WE ARE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION YEAR. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION. AN ONGOING ELECTION. ALMOST ONE MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED. AND MORE WILL VOTE THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK AND, IN JUST A FEW WEEKS, ALL AMERICANS WILL HAVE VOTED. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY DO NOT CARE. THEY JUST WANT TO JAM THIS NOMINATION THROUGH AS FAST AS THEY CAN. IT IS CALLED RAW POWER. BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE ABOUT TO LEARN SOMETHING. THEY MAY THINK THAT IT IS THEY WHO HAVE THE POWER IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT THEY DO NOT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE POWER. YOU HAVE THE POWER. AND YOU CAN MAKE IT VERY CLEAR, VERY SOON, HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING CUT OUT OF THIS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION PROCESS. EVEN WORSE, THOSE , EVEN WORSE, BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY , EVEN WORSE THAN BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY IGNORING JUSTICE GINSBURG'S FINAL WISH IS TO SELECT A NOMINEE WHO WILL UNDO HORROR , UNDO HER LIFE'S WORK. IT WILL IMPACT OUR LIVES IN THREE CRITICAL WAYS. THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL GET A JUSTICE WHO WILL GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. JUST DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, THE COURT WILL HEAR A CASE THAT COULD STRIKE DOWN THE AFFORDABLE ITS ENTIRETY. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FOR 20 MILLION AMERICANS. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TAKE AWAY MEDICARE BENEFITS FOR SENIORS. IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD TOSS OUT THE RULE THAT SAYS CHILDREN CAN BE COVERED ON THEIR PARENTS' HEALTH CARE UP TO THE AGE OF 26. ALL OF THAT WILL HURT THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE COME TO RELY ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND WHAT IS ESPECIALLY OFFENSIVE ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY ARE UP TO IS THIS , GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TAKE US BACKWARD TO A TIME WHERE YOU COULD CHARGE A WOMAN MORE FOR HER HEALTH CARE THAN YOU COULD CHARGE A MAN JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN. GETTING HER TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL TAKE US BACKWARD TO A TIME WHEN PREGNANCY COULD BE CONSIDERED A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD TAKE AWAY BIRTH CONTROL AND CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE FOR WOMEN. GET THIS , THIS RELENTLESS OBSESSION WITH OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS DRIVEN ENTIRELY BY A BLIND GREED TOWARD , A BLIND READ TOWARD , BLIND RAGE TOWARD PRESIDENT OBAMA AT A TIME WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM THE RAVAGES OF A PANDEMIC THAT HAS TAKEN OVER 200,000 LIVES. COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND HEART DAMAGE COULD WELL BECOME THE NEXT PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. IN SHORT, THERE ARE FEW THINGS THEY COULD DO THAT COULD BE MORE OFFENSIVE TO THE LEGACY AND LIFE OF JUSTICE GINSBURG THEN TO RETURN US TO THE FULL-SCALE POLICIES OF DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE THE WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, BUT THAT IS WHAT OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL DO. AND OVERTURNING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS AWAY THE NOMINEE GETS THE SUPPORT OF THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY. AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, I DEFENDED YOUR RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. AS SENATOR, I VOTED TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE, BUT NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOMINATED JUDGE AMY CONEY BARRETT AND WE KNOW WHERE JUDGE STANDS ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. JUDGE BARRETT ON RECORD OPPOSING THE DECISION THAT UPHELD THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AS RECENTLY AS 2017, SHE SPECIFICALLY ATTACKED THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S OPINION IN AN ARTICLE WHERE SHE SAID "CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS PUSHED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BEYOND ITS PLAUSIBLE MEANING TO SAVE THE STATUTE." IF NOTHING ELSE, THE VOTERS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY AND JUDGE MERRICK WILL OVERTURN , AND JUDGE BARRETT WILL OVERTURN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND THEY WILL NOT STOP THERE. THEY HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE AND RESTRICT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. JUDGE BARRETT HAS A LONG RECORD OF OPPOSING ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THERE IS NO OTHER ISSUE THAT SO DISRESPECTS AND DISHONORS THE WORK OF JUSTICE GINSBURG'S LIFE THAN UNDOING THE SEMINAL DECISION AND THE COURT , IN THE COURT'S HISTORY THAT MADE IT CLEAR A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. BUT THAT IS WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PARTY AND JUDGE BARRETT ARE. SO, LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR WHERE WE ARE. LET'S VOTE FOR HEALTH CARE. VOTE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. VOTE AS IF YOUR LIFE, YOUR CHOICE, DEPENDS ON IT, BECAUSE IT DOES. MAKE IT CLEAR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EVERY REPUBLICAN SENATOR THAT IF THEY ARE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF YOUR HEALTH CARE, YOU WILL BE JUST AS DETERMINED TO VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE. SECOND. VOTE AS IF YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE DEPENDS ON IT, BECAUSE IT DOES. IN 2013, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN SHELL V HOLDER GUTTED THE HEART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. , IN SHELBY VERSUS HOLDER GUTTED THE HEART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AFTER, STATES ENACTED DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AND TARGETED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND STUDENTS. JUSTICE GINSBURG WROTE THAT THE DECISION WAS LIKE "THROWING AWAY YOUR UMBRELLA IN A RAINSTORM." RIGHT HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA, A VOTER SUPPRESSION LAW WAS DESCRIBED BY A FEDERAL COURT IS HAVING TARGETED AFRICAN-AMERICANS , COURT AS HAVING TARGETED AFRICAN-AMERICANS WITH ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISION TO DENY US THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SURGICAL PRECISION. AFTER THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA VOTED TO GRANT FORMERLY INCARCERATED CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO VOTE, REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS RECENTLY ENACTED A MODERN-DAY POLL TAX TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THOSE CITIZENS TO EXERCISE THAT VERY RIGHT IN THIS UPCOMING ELECTION. AND THIS MODERN-DAY POLL TAX WAS UPHELD BY THE 11TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF JUDGES APPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMP. BUT, YOU SEE, HERE'S THE THING , HE KNOWS HE CANNOT WIN IF THE PEOPLE VOTE. DONALD TRUMP IS WEAK, SO HE IS THROWING UP EVERY ROADBLOCK HE CAN TO TRY AND SUPPRESS THE VOTE, AND WE THE PEOPLE CANNOT LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT. THIRD, WHAT IS IT STEAK , WHAT IS AT STAKE. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE A LIVING, TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES, AND DISMANTLE SYSTEMIC RACISM. THAT IS AT STAKE TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, COURTS CAN DETERMINE YOUR ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING WAGE, RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, OR COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR YOUR RIGHTS AT WORK. WITH AN EXTRA VOTE ON THE COURT, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS PARTY WILL CONTINUE THEIR ATTACK ON LAWS THAT KEEPS OUR AIR CLEAN AND FOOD AND WATER SAFE AND ATTACKS ANY LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DIVIDE US AND IGNORE THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL PLAGUES OUR SOCIETY. THERE DECISIONS COULD FAIL TO HOLD , THEIR DECISIONS COULD FAIL TO HOLD THE ACTORS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACCOUNTABLE. VICTIMS OF BRUTALITY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT MIGHT BE LESS SUCCESSFUL TO SUCCEED IN CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS. THESE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT WOULD UPEND JUSTICE GINSBURG'S LIFE'S WORK TO UPHOLD BASIC LIBERTIES OF ALL AMERICANS. REGARDLESS OF RACE, GENDER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, DISABILITY, OR ECONOMIC STATION. YES, SHE WAS PART OF OUR CULTURE. YES, WE WEAR THOSE NOTORIOUS BUIG T-SHIRTS WITH A LOT OF PRIDE, BUT SINCE SHE PASSED, THERE ARE PARENTS REMINDING CHILDREN THAT SHE HELPED THEIR LIVES IN CONCRETE YET IMMEASURABLE WAYS. BECAUSE OF HER, THEY COULD GET A JOB OF THEIR DREAMS, FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY FOR THEIR WORK, MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE, SERVE THE COUNTRY THEY LOVE, AND ENJOY THE FULL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENSHIP THAT THEY DESERVE FREE OF DISCRIMINATION. AND THAT LEGACY, HER BELIEF IN ALL OF US, IS AT STAKE. THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, AFFECTS EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE AND EVERY PART OF , AND EVERY BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT ALL AT ONCE WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL LAST GENERATIONS. AND ALL OVER THE NATION IN CRISIS AND AT A CROSSROADS, THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, OUR RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE, A CRISIS WITH THE NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT. SO, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT IT FEELS SOMETIMES LIKE THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH FOR US TO TAKE, TOO MUCH FOR OUR COUNTRY TO TAKE. AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE. THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL TIRED. THEY WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOUR FIGHT DOES NOT MATTER. BUT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP AND WE WILL NOT GIVE IN. WE WILL NOT LET THE INFECTION THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INJECTED INTO THE PRESIDENCY AND INTO CONGRESS, THAT HAS PARALYZED OUR POLITICS AND PITTED AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER, SPREAD TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT MORE THAN THE PRESIDENCY OR THE SENATE OR THE SUPREME COURT. THIS ELECTION AS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. , IS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. AND AS JOE BIDEN HAS SAID FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THIS RACE, IT IS ABOUT THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, WHO WE ARE, WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY WHO WE WANT TO BE. AND THAT IS WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAID GOODBYE TO JUSTICE GINSBERG. SHE UNDERSTOOD THE SOUL OF OUR NATION AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF EACH OF US AND THAT BELIEF IS ESPECIALLY RESONANT AT A PLACE LIKE SHAW UNIVERSITY, ONE OF OUR NATION'S FIRST BLACK LANDMARKS OF PEOPLE MOURN INTO BONDAGE AND BRUTALITY STOOD ON , BORN INTO BONDAGE AND BRUTALITY STOOD ON THIS GROUND AS SCHOLARS. I STAND HERE, AT THE COUNTRY'S FIRST UNIVERSITY HALL BUILT TO EDUCATE BLACK WOMEN IN AMERICA, A CENTURY LATER AND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE GREENSBORO SITTON, ELLA BAKER AND FELLOW STUDENTS , SIT IN, ELLA BAKER AND FELLOW STUDENTS STARTED THE COMMITTEE. I STAND HERE ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND WITH ALL OF YOU AS THE NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I STAND WITH JOE BIDEN, WHO WILL BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT. I STAND WITH CAL CUNNINGHAM, WHO WILL BE THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, AND I STAND WITH THEM AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO LIKE JUSTICE GINSBURG TRULY BELIEVES IN EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. MAY GOD BLESS JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476306-1/senator-kamala-harris-remarks-supreme-court	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke in Raleigh, North Carolina, on the importance of the Supreme Court.	476306-1	Speech

[HONKING] YOU KNOW, I WISH THE PRESIDENT A SPEEDY RECOVERY, AND ALL THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS VIRUS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. [HONKING] AND THANK YOU TO THE BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN FOR FOLLOWING THOSE KINDS OF RULES FOR ALL OF US. THAT IS WHY WE ARE DOING THIS. I LOVE CAMPAIGN SEASON. I LOVE GOING OUT THERE, SHAKING HANDS, KISSING BABIES, SEEING FRIENDS. THIS IS A NEW APPROACH, THIS DRIVE-IN RALLY. BUT IT IS LEADING TO THE NOTION OF RIDIN' WITH BIDEN. [HONKING] RIDIN' WITH BIDEN, ALL THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. IT HAS BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THIS COMMUNITY. WHENEVER THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN HIT NATIONALLY, LAS VEGAS GETS THE WORST OFWORSE OF IT. WE HAVE SEEN RECENTLY THAT MORE HOTELS AND AIRLINES ARE LAYING OFF PEOPLE. I GET ABOUT 100 CALLS FROM MY OFFICE EVERY DAY FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HELP WITH UNEMPLOYMENT, WHO NEED MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE. PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW. BUT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE KNOW THAT IN LAS VEGAS, WE ARE TOUGH. WE ARE VEGAS STRONG, AND WE ARE RESILIENT. [HONKING] WE HAVE PROVEN IT BEFORE AND WE WILL PROVE IT AGAIN, SO THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES HELPING US GET THROUGH THIS. WE WILL COME OUT STRONGER ON THE OTHERS BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEW LEADERS WHO WILL HELP US BUILD BACK BETTER, JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. [HONKING] THINK OF HOW MANY JOBS AND LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF WE HAD A PROPER PLAN IN THE BEGINNING AND DID NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. ULTIMATELY HERE IN NEVADA [INDISCERNIBLE] [HONKING] WE HAD TO MAKE SOME VERY HARD DECISIONS. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS LEADERSHIP, WE ARE GETTING THROUGH THIS, AND NOW HE IS TAKING TIME TO BE WITH US TODAY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR. [HONKING] THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING THE VIRUS UNDER CONTROL OR BRINGING BACK OUR JOBS. IT IS ABOUT GIVING OUR ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES THE PAY THAT THEY DESERVE AND THE PROTECTIONS THEY NEED TO BE ON THE FRONTLINES FOR US. IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND NOT A BROKEN DOWN WALL THAT WON'T KEEP PEOPLE OUT ANYWAY. IT IS ABOUT HONORING THE PEOPLE WE LOST, TAKING ACTION AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE, NOT JUST GIVING THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. [HONKING] AND THE ELECTION IS ABOUT CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE, BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PRETEND LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST. [HONKING] AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC RACISM, NOT GIVING MARCHING ORDERS TO WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS. [HONKING] THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LEADERS TO ENDORSE JOE BIDEN, BACK WHEN THERE WERE ENOUGH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TO FIT ON ONE STAGE. I KNOW JOE BIDEN, AND JOE BIDEN KNOWS US. HE HAS THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE, THE BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE, AND THE STRENGTH OF CONVICTION TO BRING THIS COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER. HE HAS A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE VIRUS AND RESTORE OUR ECONOMY. HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SUFFER PERSONAL HARDSHIPS, AND HAS EMPATHY FOR THOSE OF US WHO GO THROUGH IT, TOO. AND HE AGREES WITH ME THAT BEING PROGRESSIVE MEANS MAKING PROGRESS AND GETTING THINGS DONE, AND THAT IS WHAT I SEE IN HIM AND I THINK HE IS THE MAN OF THE HOUR, AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING HIM. [HONKING] HE CAN'T GET THERE WITHOUT YOUR HELP. WE ALL HAVE GOT TO PITCH IN. YOU ALWAYS HEAR IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE OF YOUR LIFETIME, BUT THIS TIME, IT REALLY IS. VOTE EARLY, VOTE BY MAIL, DROP OFF YOUR BALLOT. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT. MAKE A PLAN AND GO AND VOTE. AND TAKE YOUR NEIGHBORS, TAKE YOUR FAMILY, TAKE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER, TAKE YOUR HAIRDRESSER. DRAG ANYBODY YOU CAN TO THE POLLS BECAUSE CASTING THAT VOTE IS SO IMPORTANT. AND YOU CAN START RIGHT NOW BY TEXTING JOE TO 30330. GET OUT THE CELL PHONES AND TEXT JOE TO 30330. THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A CHANGE, AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE JOE BIDEN AND, HARRIS. AND SPEAKING OF KAMALA HARRIS, WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST WITH US HERE TODAY. I WANT YOU TO HELP ME WELCOME HER, GIVE HER A WARM, WARM WELCOME, BECAUSE SHE IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF DYNAMIC, EXCITING PARTNER THAT JOE BIDEN NEEDS TO GET THIS DONE, BOTH IN THE ELECTION AND IN THE GOVERNMENT. SHE HAS NEVER HESITATED TO TAKE ON POWERFUL PEOPLE OR POWERFUL INTERESTS. SHE IS WICKED SMART, DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE, AND HAS PROVEN TO BE A FORCE IN THE SENATE. SHE COMES FROM CALIFORNIA, AND WE ARE CLOSE BY, SO NEVADA IS LIKE HER FIRST COUSIN. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. SHE IS ALREADY MAKING HISTORY. SHE IS GOING TO BE AN OUTSTANDING VICE PRESIDENT. SHE IS A FRIEND OF OURS, SHE IS A GREAT PARTNER TO JOE BIDEN. GIVE HER A WARM WELCOME, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. [HONKING] IT IS SO GOOD TO BE WITH YOU ALL. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND ALL THAT YOU DO. WHAT A FIGHTER YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. OH, WOW. FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE SO MANY INCREDIBLE LEADERS THIS AFTERNOON WHO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN FROM THE BEGINNING, AND WE WILL COUNT ON THEM TO LEAD US THROUGH THESE NEXT 32 DAYS OF VICTORY. I WANT TO THANK THEM. SHELBY PARKS, OUR FIELD ORGANIZER. THE STATE GOVERNOR. [HONKING] I WAS JUST HANGING OUT WITH HIM BEHIND THE STAGE. OF COURSE, OR CONGRESSWOMAN FOR ALL SHE DOES. SHE IS A FIGHTER. GOVERNOR JACKY ROSEN. THEY WERE GOING TO BE HERE, BUT THEY WANTED TO STAY IN D.C. THEY ARE FIGHTING HOME TO BRING , THEY ARE FIGHTING TO BRING HOME RELIEF TO NEVADA. THEY ARE FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE WE TAKE CARE OF AMERICA. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US TODAY. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. ALL RIGHT , IS THIS WORKING? THERE WE GO. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE, AND WE HAVE 36 DAYS TO GET THIS DONE AND WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE. HERE IS THE THING. THIS CAMPAIGN, OUR CAMPAIGN, AS JOE SAID, IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT, WHEN JOE TALKS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR WORKING PEOPLE, ED IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR GOOD UNION JOBS, IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING TO PRESERVE OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND RENEWING PRODUCTIONS UNDER DACA. THERE IS SO MUCH ON THE LINE IN THIS ELECTION. AND THERE IS NOT A THING WE CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED. NOT A THING WE CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED. WE ARE HERE FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION, SAYING YES, WE CAN GET CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND POLICING REFORM. YES, WE CAN DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BRING HEALTH CARE TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT A PRIVILEGE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. [HONKING] THESE ARE THE THINGS ON THE LINE IN THIS ELECTION, AND WE HAVE 32 DAYS TO GET IT DONE. AND I DON'T NEED TO TELL MY COUSINS IN NEVADA , [HONKING] , ABOUT THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING WITH THE WORK WE ARE DOING. THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING, WHEN WE KNOW HERE IN NEVADA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. WHERE THERE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF AN ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE SERIOUSLY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THEN DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT WORKING PEOPLE. BUT WE SEE THE CHANGE COMING. BUT WE KNOW IT WILL NOT COME WITHOUT OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS FIGHT. WE HAVE A VISION OF THE FUTURE. OUR CAMPAIGN, AND THE WORK, THE HARD WORK, THE SACRIFICE WE WILL MAKE OVER THE NEXT 32 DAYS, IS BORN OUT OF KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE. AND THAT IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN FIGHTING AGAINST SOMETHING. IT IS ABOUT THE FIGHT WE ARE IN FOR SOMETHING, FOR THE PEOPLE, ALL THE PEOPLE. [HONKING] THAT IS WHAT OUR FIGHT IS ABOUT. AND THE THING ABOUT IT , AND THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW YOU MEASURE STRENGTH. SOME PEOPLE SAY, LOOK AT MY MUSCLES. YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY, BUT THE THING I LOVE ABOUT JOE, HE COULD ALSO SAY, YEAH, LOOK AT MY MUSCLES , THE THING ABOUT JOE, HE UNDERSTANDS THE GREATEST STRENGTH THAT ANY OF US, THAT ANY HUMAN BEING HAS, IS DISPLAYED WHEN WE LIFT UP THE CONDITION OF OTHER PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE. [HONKING] THE STRENGTH OF WHO WE ARE AND THEREFORE, THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE IS KNOWING THAT WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER, WHEN WE ARE JOINED, WHEN WE ARE UNIFIED, WHEN WE DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRY TO DIVIDE US AND TURN ON EACH OTHER, WE ARE STRONG AND IN SPITE OF ALL WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING, FOLKS, DON'T LET ANYBODY MAKE YOU FEEL ALONE. DON'T LET ANY CIRCUMSTANCE MAKE YOU FEEL ISOLATED, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. [CARS HONKING] BUT TO ACHIEVE THE CHANGE WE SEE COMING, WE HAVE TO VOTE. WE GOT TO VOTE. SO, WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO? HONK IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE EARLY. [LAUGHTER] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE BY MAIL. [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW GO AND VOTE. [CARS HONKING] [LAUGHTER] AND HERE IS THE THING. NONE OF US ARE IMMUNE. WE HAVE BEEN READING IT. WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME POWERFUL PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO VOTE. DID YOU GUYS SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN TEXAS YESTERDAY? THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF TEXAS BASICALLY STARTED GETTING RID OF THE DROP BOXES IN TEXAS. YEAH, THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. SO, HERE IS THE THING. THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THE RIGHT TO VOTE, WAS A HARD-FOUGHT AND HARD WON RIGHT. IN FACT, ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS I ATTENDED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK WAS TO WALK ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN ALABAMA WITH THE NOW GREAT ANCESTOR JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THAT BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS WHEN WE VOTE. JUST LAST MONTH, WE CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, WHEN THOSE SUFFRAGETTES, THOSE POWERFUL WOMEN, MARCHED AND FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN IN AMERICA TO VOTE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IT WAS NOT UNTIL 1965 THAT BLACK WOMEN COULD VOTE. [HONKING] SO WE KNOW THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO AND WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. BUT THIS IS THE HISTORY OF OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. OUR RIGHT TO VOTE WAS A HARD-FOUGHT AND WON RIGHTS WHICH WE WILL NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE FROM US. BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE OBSTACLES AROUND THE COUNTRY BEING PUT IN OUR WAY. WE KNOW THERE ARE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO SUGGEST YOU CANNOT TRUST THE PROCESS, TRYING TO SUGGEST IT IS RIGGED OR THIS OR THAT, BUT WE KNOW BETTER. WE KNOW BETTER. AND HERE'S THE THING I WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT. AT SOME POINT IN ADDITION TO VOTING, IT HAS TO BE ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS. AND IN ADDITION TO VOTING, IT HAS TO BE ABOUT KNOWING WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND ALSO, WE HAVE TO ASK, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE? JUST SIT BACK AND ASK THAT. WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE GOING THROUGH SUCH DIFFICULTY TO TRY AND MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE? HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. [HONKING] THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS GET BETTER. SO, NEVADA, NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE YOUR POWER. WE WILL NEVER LET ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER. WE WILL USE OUR POWER. WE WILL VOTE. WE KNOW OUR VOTE IS OUR VOICE. WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND WE KNOW WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, IN THIS FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AND IT IS A FIGHT BORN OUT OF LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY. KNOWING WHAT CAN BE, UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. THANK YOU, NEVADA. THANK YOU.

CSPANKH810202024	Kamala Harris	2020-10-08	Joe Biden and Senator Harris Campaign in Arizona	IF I WAS SCORING IT, I WOULD'VE SCORE MAY BE HARRIS-51 AND PENCE-49. I THINK PITTS WAS UNDISCIPLINED, AND THE DO NOT THINK THAT HARRIS WAS STRONG ENOUGH ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT SHE COULD'VE BEEN. PENCE LIED BY SHAKING HIS HEAD TO THE NEGATIVE WHEN HE KNEW THAT OUT OF 50 JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THAT NOT ONE HAS BEEN BLOCKED, AS HARRIS POINTED OUT. I DO NOT THINK THAT SHE WAS FORCEFUL IN THE FACT THAT WHEN HE ASKED HER A QUESTION ABOUT PACKING THE COURT, SHE SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUT THAT HE WAS NOT THERE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS, BUT RESPOND TO THE MODERATOR. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MODERATOR, I THINKS THAT SHE DID A POOR JOB WHEN IT COMES TO MODERATOR. (music) THANK YOU ALSO MUCH. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS VANESSA MONTES CAR SURVEY , I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TWO HARD-WORKING MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY MOTHER IS NO LONGER HERE, BUT VERY PRESENT IN MY HEART. SHE TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF HARD WORK AND A SACRIFICE. SHE TAUGHT ME TO BE A WOMAN OF FAITH AND LOVE ABOVE ALL. I GREW UP IN PHOENIX ARIZONA. DUE TO THE IMMENSE SACRIFICE OF MY PARENTS HARD WORK, I WAS ABLE TO ATTEND A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL, AND I AM UP PROUD GRADUATE OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER. I OWN SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESSES. INCLUDING LEGENDS EVENT CENTER. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR VENUES IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. IF YOU TOLD ME EARLIER THIS YEAR, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT I WOULD BE STANDING FOR YOU, INTRODUCING YOU TO THE FUTURE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT. THIS HAS BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR MANY OF US. IN MY INDUSTRY, THE EVENTS BUSINESS, WE HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY HARD. MY BUSINESS WAS SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE ONLY STARTED HOSTING SMALL EVENTS IN RECENT WEEKS. AFRAID FOR MY FAMILIES LIVELIHOOD, IT WAS A SACRIFICE THAT WE MADE TO KEEP OUR FRIENDS, BUT IT WASN'T EASY. WHILE BIG BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS BENEFITED FROM THE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND LOANS, MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY, WAS LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES. OUR RESTAURANTS, OUR CLOTHING STORES, OUR TECH COMPANIES, WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS CITY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE IN PLACES WHERE OUR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS CELEBRATE MAJOR MILESTONES AND SPEND THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE PROUD TO BE A PLACE WHERE HARD WORK, ALONG WITH TALENT AND INNOVATION, CAN COME TOGETHER TO CREATE JOBS AND HELP US BUILD BETTER LIVES. WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IN SENATOR HARRIS UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF HARD WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MY BUSINESS IS MORE THAN JUST WHERE I WORK. IT IS PART OF WHO I AM. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE MEASURE HOW GOOD OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BY HOW WELL OUR WORKERS ARE DOING, WHETHER THEIR WAGES ARE GOING UP AND WHETHER THEIR FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO GET AHEAD. AND WHETHER THEIR KIDS HAVE A BETTER LIFE AHEAD OF THEM. JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAVE A PLAN TO HELP US BUILD BACK BETTER. WE KNOW WHAT'S WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP , WHAT WE ARE GETTING UNDER DONALD TRUMP. NO PLAN FOR COVID-19 AND NO PLAN TO HELP US SAFELY REOPEN OUR BUSINESSES. AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, WE KNOW THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION. WHICH IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED EARLY VOTING STARTED YESTERDAY IN ARIZONA. I SAW PEOPLE LINED UP BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED TO BE THE FIRST AMONG TO CASTE THEIR BALLOTS. THIS CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER. I AM GOING TO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. TO MAKE SURE MY VOTE IS COUNTED FOR JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS, I AM VOTING NOT JUST FOR ME, I AM VOTING FOR MY WHOLE FAMILY, FOR MY SIX BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, AND FOR THEIR FUTURE. FOR MY FELLOW LATINOS PARENT , LATINOS. I HAVE FAITH THAT WE WILL ELECT THE LEADERS THAT WILL RESTORE THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. AS MR. BIDEN SAYS , [SPEAKING SPANISH] TOGETHER, WE WILL BUILD BACK BETTER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY GREAT PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TWO STRONG AND OUTSTANDING LEADERS, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (music) HI, EVERYBODY. WHERE IS VANESSA? THANK YOU, VANESSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INTRODUCTION AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL YOU DO FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF LABOR. EARLIER, JOE AND I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT THE INDIAN VETERANS NATIONAL MEMORIAL AND TAKE TRIBUTE TO THE AID OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM. WE WERE JOINED BY CINDY MCCAIN, A LONGTIME FRIEND OF JOE'S, AND SOMEONE I ADMIRE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO SERVE WITH JOHN MCCAIN IN THE SENATE AND WHAT AN INCREDIBLE AMERICAN. HE WAS A PATRIOT OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND CINDY IS SUPPORTING OUR CAMPAIGN. [APPLAUSE] AND SHE IS DOING IT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT JOE AND I WILL ALWAYS DO WHAT SHE AND JOHN DID, AND THAT IS PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST. SO WE THANK CITY , CINDY, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO BE IN ARIZONA TODAY. LATER, WE WILL TALK WITH WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE WORKING SO HARD AND DOING EVERYTHING RIGHTS, BUT STILL STRUGGLING TO GET BY. THEY ARE WHO I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE. THIS ELECTION, MORE THAN ANY OTHER IN OUR LIFETIME, WILL AFFECT EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES. THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY LAST GENERATIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. OUR NATION IS AT A CROSSROADS. JUST THINK, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE PANDEMIC, THE RECESSION, A RECKONING ON RACIAL JUSTICE, A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT IS BATTERING OUR COASTLINES AND SETTING THE WEST ON FIRE, AND THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE HANGS ON TOP OF IT ALL. BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ALONG WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS, HE IS TRYING TO JAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WHO WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. WHO WILL RIP AWAY PROTECTIONS FROM AS MANY AS 2.8 MILLION ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. TWO POINT EIGHT ARIZONANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WHILE THIS PRESIDENT DID NOT BRING THE VIRUS TO OUR SHORES, HIS RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAS ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD THE WAY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN IN NORMA'S , ENORMOUS. HIS REFUSAL TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS IS WHAT HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON OUR ECONOMY. I KNOW FOLKS ARE HURTING BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS. WE CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. IF WE ELECT JOE BIDEN AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS THE THING. JOE HAS HAD A PLAN FOR COVID AT LEAST SINCE MARCH. HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS, HE KNOWS WHAT THIS MEANS AND THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL. JOE KNOWS THESE THINGS. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT. EVEN WHEN JOE DID NOT HAVE THE BRIEFINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAD , MIKE PENCE HAD , JOE NEWBY BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE THAT THIS COULD BE SERIOUS AND UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, WE WILL CONTAIN THIS VIRUS AND SAVE LIVES AND BUILD OUR ECONOMY BACK BETTER THAN BEFORE. JOE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO RESTORES THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. HE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO CREATES GOOD PAYING JOBS AND EASES THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES. AND ABOVE ALL, JOE WILL BE A RESIDENT WHO UNITES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT, OLD AND YOUNG, FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS AND RACES TO MEET THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. I PLAN ON BEING RIGHT BY HIS SIDE AND , [APPLAUSE] , AND WE WILL BE REDDY ON DAY ONE. , READY ON DAY ONE. HERE IS THE THING, ARIZONA. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WE HAVE ONLY 26 DAYS LET'S NOT WAKE UP THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION WISHING WE HAD DONE MORE. LET'S ORGANIZE AND VOTE IN NUMBERS NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. LET'S SEND MARK KELLY TO THE SENATE. [APPLAUSE] VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT REALLY DOES. YESTERDAY, ARIZONA, VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS WERE SHIPPED TO HOMES ACROSS THIS STATE AND EARLY VOTING HAS STARTED, INCLUDING AT THE NEW MCDOWELL SQUARE VOTING CENTER ABOUT A MILE FROM HERE. SO BE A FIRST WEEK VOTER. THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO VOTE IN ARIZONA. YOU CAN VOTE BY MAIL, YOU CAN DROP OFF YOUR BALLOT AT A DROPBOX, YOU CAN VOTE EARLY IN PERSON, OR YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON ON ELECTION DAY. TO LEARN MORE, GO TO IWIL LVOTE.COM/AZ. MAKE A PLAN. TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO DO THE SAME. ARIZONA'S FUTURE, AMERICA'S FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS. SO LET'S ELECT JOE BIDEN AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE GREAT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] (music) HELLO, ARIZONA. [APPLAUSE] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK. IT REALLY IS. THANK YOU, KAMALA. THANK YOU, VANESSA. WE MET BACKSTAGE AND THE FIRST INSTANT WE HAD WAS TO HUG EACH OTHER , NO, WE HAVE TO STAY 12 FEET APART. I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO RUBEN AND DANIEL FOR BEING HERE. BIG DEAL, MAN. I NOTICE , THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A POSTMAN'S HOLIDAY, COMING TO HEAR ANOTHER POLITICIAN SPEAK. AND PUTTING ON A TIE WHEN HE SHOWS UP WITHOUT A TIE. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THE PRESIDENT AND COO OF THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL. WHERE ARE YOU? IS IN HERE OR IS HE IN HIS OFFICE? I WANT TO THANK HIM. ALSO, THE PRESIDENT OF LOCAL 1912. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING, WE SAID, NOT A JOKE, IT WAS COINCIDENTAL, SHE SAID, I LOVE THE CARPENTERS, THE FIRST OUTFIT THAT ENDORSED ME WHEN I RAN FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE CARPENTERS. I SAID, I REMEMBER A GUY, PRESIDENT OF THE CARPENTERS UNION FROM DELAWARE, A 350-YEAR-OLD CITY, WAS THE FIRST WANT TO ENDORSE ME AS WELL. WE HAVE BEEN WITH THEM MICHAEL CAREER. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FRIEND, WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER A LONG TIME. 520,000 CARPENTERS, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE ARMY TO HAVE BEHIND YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU HAVE MY FULL CAREER AND I HOPE YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD YOURS AS WELL. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN SCRANTON, THE CARPENTERS BROUGHT ME TO THE DANCE AND WE ARE GOING HOME TOGETHER. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. PEOPLE WHO SHAPED THE SKYLINES, WHO BUILT THE FOUNDATIONS WE RELY ON, THE CARPENTERS. LABOR BROUGHT ME TO DANCE AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I'VE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IS BECAUSE OF LABOR. I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY. I REALLY MEAN IT. I GET IN TROUBLE FOR SAYING THIS, BUT IT IS TRUE. YOU ARE THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA, THE SPINE OF AMERICA. YOU ARE THE ONES YOU BUILD THE COUNTRY, NOT WALL STREET AND CEO'S, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE BUILD IT AGAIN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD IT BACK BETTER FOR REAL. KAMALA AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAUGHT IT, BUT THE SENATOR HAD A HECK OF A NIGHT LAST NIGHT. [APPLAUSE] I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME CREDIT FOR KNOWING HOW TO PICK A VICE PRESIDENT. I COULD NOT BE PROUDER. SHE IS LIKE A YOUNGER SISTER. REMARKABLE CHARACTER AND VISION. ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR THE PEOPLE. ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE, NOT HER, ALWAYS. I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. KEMAL AND I ARE ABOUT TO KICK OFF A TOUR VISITING BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY. SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, THEY ARE BUSTING THEIR NEXT, THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS. SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE MORE JOBS THAN THE MAJOR CORPORATE ENTITIES. THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOUND ITSELF HAVING TO GO THROUGH REAL CHALLENGING TIMES. THE CONGRESSMAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT THAN MOST PEOPLE KNOW. LIKE CHEF SOLANA, THE CHEF OWNS TWO RESTAURANTS IN PHOENIX. ONE, SHE HAD , SHE HAD TO CLOSE ONE OF THEM DOWN. SHE IS WORKING HARD TO KEEP THE OTHER ONE AFLOAT. WE ARE GOING TO BE VISITING IT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. IT ISN'T EASY. THE LOAN THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE BACK IN THE SPRING BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION PASSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE HELPS FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. SHE IS SCRAPING BY, TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR HER 10 EMPLOYEES, SOME OF WHOM HAVE BEEN WITH HER FOR DECADES. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE IS FACING A TERMINAL DISEASE. SHE HAD TO CANCEL HER OWN HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER FINISHING A ROUND OF TREATMENT TO RECENTLY JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. IT IS DEVASTATING. EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT WHAT SHE IS GOING THROUGH. I THINK YOU ALL ARE. I KNOW I AM BECAUSE I KNOW WE KNOW IT DID NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. IF THEY HAD JUST DONE WHAT YOU PASSED, JUST MOVED FORWARD. HER STORY IS INCREASINGLY A COMMON STORY OF ARIZONA WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. TOO MANY ARE FACING HARD TIMES NOW. THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST BUT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE IT IS ENOUGH. YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT, YOU ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A FAIR SHOT. ALL THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. THAT IS HOW MY DAD FELT WHEN HE COULD NOT FIND WORK WHEN COLD DIED , COAL DIED. HE HAD TO TAKE US UP THE LONGEST WALK A PARENT EVER HAS TO TAKE TO SAY, I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO ST. PAUL'S, THAT HAS LOST HIS JOB, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE. I REMEMBER HIM TAKING US TO OUR GRANDPA'S HOUSE, ME AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER AND MY MOM WHO WAS SHORTLY GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER CHILD AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR MY DAD, SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN HAVE DONE THE SAME THING, HAD TO GO TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AND SAY, I HAVE TO ASK A FAVOR. I KNOW HOW MUCH PRIDE IT COST HIM. CAN YOU TAKE THEIR OF THEM , CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR A YEAR? I WILL BE BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD BUT BY THE TIME HE WAS ABLE TO GET A GOOD JOB, ENOUGH TO GET US AN APARTMENT IN DELAWARE, HE ENDED UP THEN GETTING A GOOD JOB, A DECENT JOB MANAGING A CAR DEALERSHIP. HE WORKED HARD TO BUILD A DECENT MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. HE HAD AN EXPRESSION. I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. HE SAID, I DON'T EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE MY PROBLEMS, BUT I EXPECT THEM TO AT LEAST UNDERSTAND MY PROBLEMS. AMERICA DESERVES A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE AMERICA , WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. WHO SEES WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE, WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOUR PROSPERITY, YOUR DREAM, YOUR AMERICAN DREAM. YOU ARE FACING REAL CHALLENGES AND THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A PRESIDENT TO EXACERBATES THEM. WHO IGNORES YOU. I'M GOING TO SAY IT, I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT, THE PRESIDENT LOOKS DOWN ON US. WHO THINKS THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THE NATION, YOU ARE A LOSER, A SUCKER. THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH CINDY. MY SON PASSED AWAY NOW COMING ON FIVE YEARS, IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY, WON THE BRONZE STAR, HE VOLUNTEERED, HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE HAD TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO GO TO IRAQ FOR A YEAR. I PROMISE YOU, HE WAS NOT A LOSER, HE WAS NOT A SUCKER. HE, LIKE ALL THE VETERANS WE MET WITH THIS AFTERNOON ALONGSIDE CINDY MCCAIN, ARE PATRIOTS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING AN AMERICAN IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. JOHN MCCAIN, WHO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ASKING ME TO DO HIS EULOGY, WE USED TO ARGUE, WE WERE LIKE BROTHERS, WE WOULD FIGHT LIKE HELL, BUT WE ALWAYS ENDED UP TOGETHER. THAT IS HOW IT USED TO BE. IT USED TO BE THAT WAY ACROSS THE BOARD. HE WAS NOT A LOSER. THEY ARE ALL HEROES. THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SAY ANYTHING TO DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MISTAKES HE MAKES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, HE RECENTLY SAID , I ASKED WHERE HE GOT THE COVID, HE SAID, I PROBABLY GOT IT FROM BLUE STAR PARENTS, PEOPLE WHO LOST A CHILD IN BATTLE. HE SAID, THEY LIKE TO GET CLOSE TO ME AND HUGGED ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY NO. LOOK. WE HAVE PAID TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOTIC LEADERSHIP. 210,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS VIRUS. WE LOSE MORE EVERY DAY. 6000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN LOST. 6000, DON. , GONE. 200 , 220,000 ARIZONANS HAVE BEEN INFECTED. 122,000 JOBS IN ARIZONA STILL HAVE NOT COME BACK. NINE TIMES MORE ARIZONANS ARE ON UNEMPLOYMENT EACH WEEK THEN BEFORE THE CRISIS HIT. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING, SCHOOLS ARE NOT BACK TO NORMAL. DONALD TRUMP CAN'T FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. THE HOUSE PASSED THE HEROES ACTS, THE SECOND BIG PACKAGE, TO GET PEOPLE ON THEIR FEET AGAIN. BUT THE PRESIDENT AND MITCH MCCONNELL DID NOTHING TO MOVE THE LEGISLATION. A LOT OF CITIES AND STATES ARE GOING BANKRUPT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS. OUR FOUNDERS WERE SMART, THE REASON WHY THEY PUT THE CONSTITUTION THE WAY THEY DID IS SO CONGRESS, THE SENATE, THE HOUSE GOOD DEFICIT SPEND TO COMPENSATE FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE GET OUT OF A HOLE. TRUMP IS SPENDING MORE TIME , I HAVE BEEN CALLING ON THIS FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS , HE SHOULD GET OUT OF HIS BUNKER AND OUT OF THE SAND TRAP OF HIS GOLF COURSES , NOT A JOKE, THINK ABOUT IT. I HAVE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. HE NEVER ONE SINGLE TIME TRY TO BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO TRY TO GET A SETTLEMENT. NOT ONCE. YOU CAN'T NAME ME A PRESIDENT IN THE LIFETIME OF ANY OF YOU THAT REFUSED TO DEAL THAT WAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. BUT THE LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT ON HIS WATCH. ON TUESDAY, THE CONGRESS , I'M SURE YOU WERE NOT SURPRISED BY IT , ON TUESDAY, HE ANNOUNCED HE IS WALKING AWAY FROM NEGOTIATIONS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR WORKING THE WEALTHY. IF THIS WAS NOT SO TRUE, IT WOULD SOUND SO BIZARRE. THIS PRESIDENT HAS FORGOTTEN THE PEOPLE THAT HE SAID HE IS FIGHTING FOR. I WILL NEVER FORGET, BECAUSE I SEE THE WORLD FOR WHERE I GREW IN SCRANTON. I NOTE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS, THAT THE WORKING CLASS BUILT THIS COUNTRY. I MEASURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS WITH WHAT FAMILIES ARE TALKING ABOUT, SITTING AROUND THEIR KITCHEN TABLES. ABOUT HAVING A DECENT JOB AND BENEFITS. ABOUT KEEPING THE SMALL BUSINESS DREAM ALIVE. ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE THIS MORNING. NEW TIRES. WE HAVE TO WAIT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEM. WE CANNOT DO IT. WHO IS GOING TO TELL HER THAT SHE CANNOT GO BACK TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE WE CANNOT BORROW MONEY ANYMORE. WE HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE TODAY. INCLUDING HERE IN ARIZONA. WHO WORRIED ABOUT IF THEY CAN PAY THIS MONTH'S MORTGAGE PAYMENT. 20 MILLION. LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET THROWN OUT INDUSTRY IF THEY CANNOT PAY THE RENT. THESE GUYS PROVIDED FOR ALL OF THAT. NOTHING. BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE. MY DAD USED TO SAY THAT JOEY, YOUR JOB IS A LOT MORE THAN ABOUT YOUR PAYCHECK. IT IS ABOUT DIGNITY, YOUR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT RESPECT. IT IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR KID IN THE EYE AND SAY, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. AND MEAN IT. THAT IS WHAT KAMALA AND I ARE FOCUSING ON. TO SAY TO OUR KIDS, IT IS GOING TO BE OK. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. WE'RE GOING TO REOPEN SAFELY AND STRONGLY. IF WE ARE GOING TO GET ANYTHING DONE, WE HAVE TO GET , WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER. YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINGS DONE SHOW, BUT THAT WAS THE PAST. IF WE CANNOT BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, WE ARE DEAD. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY THAT DEPENDS ON A CONSENSUS. YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT WAS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME, BUT I MADE A MAJOR SPEECH THAT I WORKED ON REALLY HARD IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA. I DID IT TWO DAYS AGO. I TALKED ABOUT IN LINCOLN TERMS, THAT WE HAVE TO BRING AMERICA TOGETHER. WE CANNOT HOLD GRUDGES. I'M RUNNING WITH A PROUD DEMOCRAT, WITH A CAPITAL D. BY WILL BE AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, NOT A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK HARD FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SUPPORT ME. I PROMISE YOU. LOOK AMERICA. THE FACT IS, THAT IS THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. IT IS A DUTY TO CARE. FOR EVERYBODY. DOCTORS WHO VOTED FOR. AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH. ALL THE AMERICANS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO REMAIN DIVIDED. WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS, AND DO NOTE THAT POWER IS? THE LITTLE STICKER THAT YOU HAVE ON. THE POWER TO VOTE. YOU CAN STILL REGISTER HERE IN ARIZONA TO VOTE. EARLY VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ARIZONANS VOTE BY MAIL. THOSE BALLOTS START TO ARRIVE AT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. KAMALA AND I ARE SAYING THAT THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO RETURN YOUR BALLOT QUICKLY, AND NOT RISK DELAYS. TURN THE MAIL-IN BALLOT AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD. YOUR VOICE CAN OVERCOME CORRECT AND YOUR VOICE THROUGH YOUR VOTE, CAN OVERCOME EVERY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SETTING UP? THE ARGUMENT THAT THESE VOTES ARE NOT GOING TO MATTER. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENS TODAY WITH THE FBI. THE FBI ARRESTED A GROUP OF MILITIAMEN. THEY HAD PLANNED AND PLANNED TO GO IN AND KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN. REMEMBER THOSE GUYS WOULD BE ASSAULT RIFLES STANDING IN THEIR DRIVEWAYS? THE PRESIDENT SAYING THINGS IN MY DEBATE WITH THEM, TO THE PROUD BOYS, AND ALL WHITE THE PREMISES GROUP, STANDS DOWN AND STAND READY? THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF. WE CANNOT JUST WIN BY A VOTE. WE HAVE TO ALL TURN OUT. WE CAN BE BETTER THAN WE HAVE SEEN. WE CAN'T BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BREASTS. , WE CAN BE WHAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST. AT OUR BEST, WE ARE THAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT IS NOT A PROSAIC THING. THE FACT IS, AMERICANS NEVER FAIL. WHEN STANDING UP TOGETHER. WE ARE THE ONLY NATION IN THE WORLD THAT HAS COME OUT OF EVERY CRISIS, WAR AND ECONOMIC, STRONGER THAN WE WENT INTO THE CRISIS. FOLKS, I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC TODAY ABOUT AMERICA'S CHANCES AT HOME AND IN THE WORLD THAN I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG TIME. I WORK WITH A LOT OF PRESIDENTS. I MEAN IT. WE HAVE A CHANCE. TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE OUR COUNTRY, BUT TO CHANGE THE WORLD. WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY THE WEST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO US. , THE REST OF THE WORLD COMPARES TO U.S.. IT IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT A POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE THAT HAS THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWING US. THAT EXAMPLE IS BEING TRASH AROUND THE WORLD. AS THE SENATOR SAID LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE, IT IS TRUE. 17 MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD 'S ASKS WHAT LEADERS THEY ADMIRE AND TRUST THE MOST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? MORE PEOPLE TRUSTED THE LEADER OF CHINA AND PUTIN OF RUSSIA RATHER THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS PROFOUND SECURITY AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS. LET'S NOT QUIT FOLKS. THERE IS NO QUITTING IN AMERICA. WE HAVE NEVER QUIT, AND IF WE NEED YOU TO STAND UP AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY, WE NEED YOU NOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] (music) THANK YOU EVERYBODY. (music) MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND YOU MAY HAVE THE RIGHT WE ARE ALL LIVING AN EXAMPLE GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND. GOT TO MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND GIVE US WHAT YOU GET. DON'T LET OUR WORLD GO ROUND.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?476759-1/joe-biden-senator-harris-campaign-arizona	2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) campaigned in Arizona the day after the vice presidential debate.	476759-1	Speech

A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGNED IN FLORIDA, WHERE SHE SPOKE AT A VOTER MOBILIZATION EVENT IN JACKSONVILLE ON THE STATE'S FIRST DAY OF IN PERSON VOTING. (music) HELLO, EVERYBODY! IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN JACKSONVILLE. [LAUGHTER] MS. REILLY, YOU ARE AMAZING, AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING THIS STAGE. AND ALL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WORK. CONGRESSMAN LAWSON, HE IS A FORCE. THANK YOU FOR SENDING HIM TO D.C.. I HAVE SEEN HIM IN ROOMS WITH THE CAMERAS ON, WHEN THE CAMERAS OFF, HE IS ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR FLORIDA. CAN WE PLEASE HERE IT FOR CONGRESSMAN LAWSON? [APPLAUSE] WHO VOTED TODAY? [APPLAUSE] THERE WE GO. I CAME TO FLORIDA TODAY TO HELP KICK OFF EARLY VOTING AND I CAME TO THANK YOU, EVERYBODY HERE, FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING. THE VOTERS OF FLORIDA, YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, I AM SURE OF IT. THE VOTES THAT YOU WERE GOING TO CAST, THE VOTES THAT YOU HAVE CAST, THE FOLKS THAT YOU GET TO GO VOTE BETWEEN TODAY AND LET'S REMIND EVERYBODY TO VOTE EARLY TODAY AND SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT WITH PEOPLE YOU NEVER MEET, PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER HEAR YOUR NAMES. BECAUSE YOU VOTED WITH YOUR VOICE AND THE POWER OF YOUR VOICE, YOU WILL VERY LIKELY DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. SO I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF TO SAY THANK YOU. TO SAY THANK YOU. LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL EVERYBODY HERE, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. WHO WATCHED THE DEBATE? [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD TWO, I GUESS. I REALLY MEANT THAT TOWN HALL. DID YOU ALL SEE JOE BIDEN AND THAT TOWN HALL? WASN'T A SPECTACULAR? IN THIS ELECTION, FOLKS HAVE GOT TWO CHOICES. I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN THOSE TOWN HALLS LAST WEEK REALLY MADE CLEAR THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHOICES BEING MADE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO IS DEDICATED TO BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS THAT HE AND PRESIDENT BLOCK , PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA CREATED WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE, AN INITIATIVE BORN OUT OF THE BELIEF THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. IT IS JUST NOT RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, THAT THEY GET DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE AN INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS WE DON'T COVER IT. THEY GOT RID OF THAT BAN, AND SAID NO LONGER CAN YOU DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IF YOU HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN FIGHTING FOR WORKING PEOPLE HIS ENTIRE LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO, RIGHT NOW WITH BILL BARR IS IN THE UNITED STATES OF RECORD TRYING TO SUE AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT , IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, TRYING TO SUE AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY WILL GET RID OF HEALTH CARE FOR 20 MILLION PEOPLE. THEY WILL LOSE THE PROTECTIONS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN NEED COVERAGE IF THEY HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT IS SHAMEFUL. THERE IS A CLEAR CONTRAST HERE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN SAYING TAXES WILL NOT BE RAISED ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 PER YEAR. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO PASSED TAX BREAKS FOR THE 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. IN FLORIDA, YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE HURTING. PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. ONE IN EIGHT FLORIDIANS IS DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS. IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW, ONE IN FIVE FLORIDIANS IS DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS BEING UNABLE TO PAY THEIR RENT IN SEPTEMBER. YET, DONALD TRUMP WOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS OK. HIS MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY IS BASED ON THE STOCK MARKET. OUR MEASURE IS BASED ON HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW YOU DOING? WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALL WEARING MASKS. THE REASON I'M NOT WEARING ONE AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE I AM THIS FAR AWAY FROM HER BODY. WHY ARE WE WEARING MASKS? WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS INFORMED ON JANUARY 28 THAT IT WAS LETHAL AND KILLED FIVE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS THE FLU. HE WAS INFORMED IT COULD HURT CHILDREN. HE WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS CONTAGIOUS AND AIR BOUND. HE STOOD AT RALLIES, STOOD BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND HE DID NOT TELL YOU WHAT HE KNEW. IMAGINE IF YOU KNEW ON JANUARY 20 WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28, AND WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE OR BEEN ABLE TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, CHECK YOUR CHILDREN, KNOWING THAT IT WOULD BE INEVITABLE THAT THERE WOULD BE A TIME THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO STAY HOME FROM WORK AND MAYBE YOU COULD PLAN FOR THAT INSTEAD, HE HELD ONTO THAT INFORMATION, HE COVERED IT UP. AND HE TOLD THE PEOPLE, US, WE THE PEOPLE, YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK, ANOTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN STANCE WITH THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE. HE KNOWS THAT THIS ELECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE PEOPLE. WHAT IS AHEAD OF US IS A FIGHT KNOWING THAT WE DON'T WANT A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FULL TIME TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION AGAINST US. WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW, STANDING IN THE RAIN, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS AND WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN THE STRENGTH OF OUR PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY BASED ON OUR LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT. HERE IN FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME OF THE GREAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, SOME OF THE MAYORS. I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT SOME OTHER FOLKS ELECTED IN FLORIDA. I AM NOT GOING TO MENTION ANY NAMES. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUGGEST TO YOU THAT YOU CAN'T TRUST OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT VOTING AND SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THERE IS SOMETHING THAT LACKS INTEGRITY ABOUT OUR SYSTEM. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT YOUR POWER TO VOTE, CONFUSE FOLKS ABOUT HOW TO VOTE. WE ARE SMARTER THAN THAT AND WE KNOW THE POWER THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE VOTE. SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO SIT GET ANOTHER THAT WE HAVE TO VOTE TO HONOR ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS, LIKE THE LATE, GREAT JOHN LEWIS. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO VOTE , WE JUST HONOR TO THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, ALL OF THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO VOTE. WE ALSO FIGHT FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT BLACK WOMEN DID NOT GET TO VOTE UNTIL 1965. WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THIS. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU AND THEN I'M GOING TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO GET OUT THE RAIN. AND PLEASE GET BACK IN YOUR CARS. I WILL TALK LOUDER. HERE'S THE THING. ALL THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO PUT ROADBLOCKS IN, THEY HAVE BEEN PICKING UP THE DROP BOXES SO PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING WHERE THE DROPBOX IS. YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND ASK, WHY ARE THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? HERE IS THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, WE WENT , WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN! THEY KNOW THAT WE VOTE FOR JUSTICE, WE VOTE FOR FAIRNESS. JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. CLIMATE JUSTICE IS ON THE BALLOT IN 2020. WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AT STAKE AND WE KNOW OUR POWER. THAT IS WHY WE WILL VOTE EVERY DAY UNTIL ELECTION DAY AND GET THIS THING DONE. THANK YOU.

MAYOR, I WANT TO THANK YOU. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE LAST WEEK. IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE CAME. WE RE-CREATED THE SCHEDULE TO BE WITH YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. NOT JUST A LEADER HERE IN ASHEVILLE, BUT NORTH CAROLINA AND THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF. [APPLAUSE] THE CHANCELLOR WHO IS HERE AND WHO GAVE ME SUCH A WONDERFUL AND WARM WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO IN NURTURING AND GROWING THE MINDS OF OUR INCREDIBLE FUTURE AND CURRENT LEADERS. [APPLAUSE] TO THE MEMBERS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA GENERAL ASSEMBLY, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE THE CHIEF OF THE EASTERN , CHEROKEE INDIANS. I WANT TO THANK HIM. I WANT TO THANK COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND CITY COUNCILS, SHERIFF QUINTON MILLER AND ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE] SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I AM GOING TO MOVE THIS SO I CAN SEE YOU GUYS. 13 DAYS TO GO. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE, SISTERS AND BROTHERS. WE CANNOT SPARE A MINUTE IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW EVERYONE HERE, AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY IS PREPARED TO DO. AS JOE BIDEN SAYS, FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THAT IS REALLY WHAT IS GOING ON. IT IS ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. IT IS ABOUT KNOWING WE DESERVE MORE AND WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED EVEN BEFORE COVID STRUCK. IN MANY WAYS, I THOUGHT OF THIS PANDEMIC OF BEING AN ACCELERATOR. IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE AND HAS MADE IT WORSE. LET'S THINK ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS VIRUS. WE CAN'T OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WERE INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF COVID-19. THEY WERE INFORMED. FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO KILL PEOPLE THAN THE FLU. THEY WERE INFORMED IT COULD HARM CHILDREN. INFORMED IT IS AIRBORNE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THE FAMILIES OF ASHEVILLE, THE FAMILIES OF NORTH CAROLINA COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT INFORMATION ON THAT DATE? TO PREPARE? B IT TO STOCK UP ON TOILET PAPER, OR TO PLAN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN $1000 IN SAVINGS? WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE KNOWING THAT IT IS PREDICTABLE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK FOR A WHILE. SADLY, WE STILL HAVE SO MANY WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE SICK LEAVE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE. HE DID NOT TELL US. THEY SAT ON THAT INFORMATION. THEY COVERED IT UP. INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES STUCK , WHOSE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE TO KEEP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE SAT ON THIS INFORMATION AND SUGGESTED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IF YOU DO. NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE OVER 220,000 AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM HAVE FAMILIES, AND THEY COULD NOT SEE THEM, HOLD THEIR HANDS, TOUCH THEM IN THEIR LAST DAYS ON THIS EARTH. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE OVER 8 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS. HAVING UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING WHAT DOCTORS ARE TELLING US HIS LUNG SCARRING AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. IN THE MIDST OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, YOU'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR , IT IS STRANGER THAN FICTION. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT EXPRESSION? WE ARE LIVING IT. WE ARE LIVING IT, SISTER. WHAT ARE WE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC? DONALD TRUMP AND BILL BARR ARE IN THE SUPREME COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE HAPPEN. THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, IT IS ESTIMATED AT LEAST 23 MILLION AMERICANS WILL LOSE THEIR COVERAGE. THERE IS THIS WEIRD THING , A COUPLE , BUT THE THING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, HE HAS GOT THIS WEIRD OBSESSION WITH WANTING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN CREATED. IT IS THIS WEIRD OBSESSION, RIGHT? IF HE IS SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, REMEMBER, IT LAID IN PLACE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS DIABETES, ASTHMA, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION CALLED COVID AND THEY ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT. THAT ALONE IS REASON ENOUGH THAT HE IS INCAPABLE OF BEING A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PROTECT THE WELL-BEING AND HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY HE HAS GOT TO GO. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION, THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AN ACCELERATOR. OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAD TO APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. MANY OF WHOM DID NOT HAVE PAID SICK LEAVE, DID NOT HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IN, WHAT I CALL, AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS , BY THE WAY, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION SEASON, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ELECTION YEAR, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ELECTION THAT IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE VOTED AND THE ELECTION WILL BE OVER IN 13 DAYS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE WHO WILL BE THERE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS THE PERSON WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHO WILL FILL A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND. [APPLAUSE] YET, THEY ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THIS NOMINATION. I SERVED ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY PUBLICLY, I WILL OPPOSE HER CONFIRMATION. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. IT INCLUDES THE ILLEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS, THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE. THAT INCLUDES THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEY ARE PUSHING THIS THING THROUGH. THERE IS A BILL SITTING ON THE DESK THAT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 150 DAYS CALLED THE HEROES ACT THAT WOULD BRING RELIEF TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING. IN FOOD LINES FOR HOURS. THE ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IN AMERICA WHO IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 AS BEING HUNGRY, WHO NEED AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR. SNAP BENEFITS. WE USED TO CALL IT FOOD STAMPS. IT IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY. [APPLAUSE] THEY ARE PUSHING THROUGH THIS NOMINATION INSTEAD OF SENATE REPUBLICANS SAYING A VOTE ON THAT BILL. INCLUDING ONE SENATOR FROM THIS STATE. [BOOING] YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED JOE BIDEN TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO WAS ONE OF THE CREATORS AND REASONS WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHO WILL MAKE A COMMITMENT , HAS MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU, NORTH CAROLINA AND THE PUBLIC, THAT HE WILL EXPAND COVERAGE. SHE WILL EXPAND HEALTH. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HE IS SAYING HE WILL EXPAND HEALTH CARE, UNDERSTANDING FOR TOO LONG WE ARE PRETENDING HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT A BODY THAT STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN, THE BODY STARTS FROM THE NECK UP, THAT IS METAL HEALTH CARE. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP IS SUING TO GET RID OF IT. WE HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS, WE MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY BASED ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WORKING FAMILIES IN AMERICA. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% IN THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, WHICH WILL LEAD TO A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. JOE BIDEN SAYS I AM NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE WHO MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. HE SAYS I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE FIRST HOME BUYERS GET A TAX CREDIT TO HELP THEM WITH DOWN PAYMENTS AND CLOSING COSTS, KNOWING HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS TO CREATE WEALTH AND AMERICAN FAMILIES. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH SUPPORTING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF AMERICA AND WE WILL TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING FOR THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN THE HIGHEST NEED COMMUNITIES WITH THE LOWEST TAX BASE BECAUSE THE CHILDREN OF THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A GOD-GIVEN CAPACITY TO BE NURTURED AND THRIVE, BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, DONALD TRUMP WHO PUT BETSY DEVOS IN OFFICE. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS BEEN REJECTING SCIENCE FROM DAY ONE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS CLIMATE CRISIS WHICH IS THREATENING OUR EXISTENCE. REJECTING SCIENCE ON THIS VIRUS. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO EMBRACES SCIENCE WHO WILL BE A LEADER WHO SAYS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS MUST GUIDE THE POLICY DECISIONS WE MAKE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT LITERALLY THREATEN THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. [APPLAUSE] THERE ARE VERY CLEAR CHOICES HERE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DO BELIEVE THE OUTCOME OF THIS RACE WILL, IN MANY WAYS, BE DECIDED BY YOU. NORTH CAROLINA. IT WILL BE. [APPLAUSE] IN THAT WAY, THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS YOU ARE MAKING WILL IMPACT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN THAT WAY, WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO VOTE, AND VOTE EARLY, IS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAME, BUT WHOSE LIVES WILL FOREVER BE CHANGED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I AM HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA 13 DAYS BEFORE THIS ELECTION TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ALL HAVE ALREADY DONE AND WHAT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO DO. THIS ISSUE BEFORE US OF WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH FIXING THE PROBLEMS, BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH RESTORING , IN OUR COUNTRY, WHAT WE KNOW TO BE OUR HIGHEST IDEALS. UNITY, BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER, REJECTING THESE NOTIONS OF FEAR, HATE AND DIVISION. DOING WHAT WE KNOW WE HAVE HAD THE CAPACITY AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO TO REGAIN OUR STANDING IN A WAY WE CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR NATION. ALL OF THIS IS AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. JOE AND I ARE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OURS IS A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS PROBABLY BUILT ONE OF THE BROADEST COALITIONS OF ANY CAMPAIGN IN RECENT HISTORY. WE HAVE GOT THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ALL RACES. [APPLAUSE] WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TO STRENGTHEN OUR NATION, TO TAKE BACK THE SOUL OF OUR COUNTRY, IT IS ABOUT ALL OF US AND ALL OF US BEING A PART OF WHERE WE GO AND WHERE WE NEED TO GO. I WANT TO THANK YOU, ASHEVILLE FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. 13 DAYS TO GO. WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AND HAVE ANY REGRETS. MY LAST POINT IS THIS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT US, THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK IN OUR EYES AND ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? HERE IS THE THING, WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN THIS PARKING LOT IN ASHEVILLE WITH THE MAYOR AND ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED, WE MADE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS HAD STEAK, HOW WE REMINDED PEOPLE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, AND WE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THANK YOU ALL.

CSPANKH2310202027	Kamala Harris	2020-10-23	Senator Kamala Harris Campaigns in Atlanta	Host: THAT IS MAUREEN IN NEW YORK. ONE TOPIC AMONG MANY FROM LAST NIGHTS DEBATE AND TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION THE CANDIDATES AND WHERE THEY GO FROM HERE WE WILL GO BACK TO JOHN. WHAT'S UP ATLANTA? I'M SO HAPPY TO BE BACK. HEY EVERYBODY. CAN WE HEAR IT FOR RICK HART? WHERE IS HE? WHERE DID HE GO? HE WAS SO GOOD. HE IS SO GOOD. HE IS THE HEAD OF , THERE YOU ARE. RICK IS THE HEAD OF THE GEORGIA STUDENTS FOR BIDEN COCHAIR AND I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND HE SAYS THAT OFTEN, HE UNDERSTANDS HIS LONG LIFE OF SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO PUBLIC SERVICE BUT HE IS ALWAYS UPLIFTING THOSE WHO ARE THE EMERGING LEADERS AND RICK HART IS ONE OF THEM SO CAN WE GIVE IT UP FOR RICK VICK IS THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY TAKING ON THEIR ROLE IN LEADERSHIP KNOWING THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH JUICE , AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I CAME BACK TO ATLANTA. I LOVE ATLANTA. THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. I WAS ON THE STAGE OF MOREHOUSE IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR AND YOU KNOW COMING TO ATLANTA ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE BLACK AND HOLD ELECTED OFFICE AND AMERICA COMING TO ATLANTA IS LIKE COMING BACK TO THE WOMB. IT REALLY IS. IT IS BECAUSE ATLANTA REPRESENTS SO MUCH ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. ATLANTA REPRESENTS THE HOPES AND DREAMS AND THE FIGHT TO MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF AMERICA. ATLANTA IS A PLACE THAT HAS. LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN NATIONAL LEADERS AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT HOPE WILL FUEL THE FIGHT. IT WILL BE WHAT GROUNDS US IN KNOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE GOT TO JUST ORGANIZE THE FOLKS AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZE THAT NOTHING WE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED AS A NATION BY WAY OF PROGRESS CAME WITHOUT A FIGHT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE FOR THE NEXT 11 DAYS, GEORGE, A FIGHT FOR THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. THIS IS A FIGHT THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. WE KNOW THAT AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY WILL ALWAYS BE AS STRONG AS WE THE PEOPLE ARE IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THOSE IDEALS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IN A FIGHT FOR THE IDEALS AND IN THE FIGHT FOR THE DIGNITY, AND A FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IS AT STAKE. WE ARE DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC AND WE ARE DEALING WITH IT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT AND CRISES THAT ARE OCCURRING AT ONE TIME IN OUR NATION. WE ARE LOOKING AT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN 200, OVER 220,000 AMERICANS LOSE THEIR LIVES IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY IN THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH COULDN'T EVEN BE WITH THEIR FAMILY, WITH PEOPLE THEY LOVE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 8.5 MILLION FOLKS WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND THANKFULLY HAVE LIVED THAT ARE LOOKING AT UNTOLD LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC WE HAVE A DONALD TRUMP WHO THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD WE KNOW NEW BACK ON JANUARY 28, HE KNEW THE DEAL ABOUT COVID. HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT IT CAN KILL PEOPLE, THAT IT IS FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO KILL AS THE FLU. HE KNEW IT WAS AIRBORNE. HE KNEW IT COULD HARM CHILDREN AND HE SAT ON THAT INFORMATION AND HE DID NOT TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD YOU KNOWN WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28? HOW FOLKS MIGHT HAVE PREPARED, HOW FOLKS MIGHT HAVE SAID YOU KNOW I'VE GOT TO BUY SOME EXTRA TOILET PAPER AT THE VERY LEAST BUT ALSO THE FACT IS THAT EVEN IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA DURING THE PANDEMIC FOLKS WERE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO TRY TO PAY THE BILLS AND PAY THE RENT SO IN OUR AMERICA NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND HE SAID ON THIS INFORMATION AND THEN HAVE THE GALL, HAD THE NERVE TO SAY IT WAS A HOAX TO MUZZLE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS TO SUGGEST THAT HEAT KEEPS THE LEDGER AND YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T WORE A MASK AND YOU ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WEAR A MASK AND NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE. NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE. AND HE IS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WITH HIS TOY BILL BARR TRYING TO SUE GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. LET'S STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS MAN BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE WHEN HE QUESTIONED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SO WEIRDLY OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA CREATED. THINK ABOUT THAT. WE DON'T NEED PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE SESSIONS. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? SO HE IS IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH BROUGHT HEALTH COVERAGE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS, COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO HAS DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BREAST CANCER, LUPUS? AND HE WANTS TO GET RID OF THE THING THAT BROUGHT KAREN DIGNITY TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS DONALD TRUMP HAS GOT TO GO. GOT TO GO. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THESE CRISES, THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. WE ARE LOOKING AT FAMILIES THAT ARE GETTING UP AT THE OF DAWN TO DRIVE AND SIT IN THEIR CAR IN A FOOD LINE FOR HOURS PRAYING THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE END OF THE LINE BEFORE THE FOOD RUNS OUT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IN AMERICA ARE DESCRIBING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS HUNGRY. WE ARE IN A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA AND AGAIN ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS LET ME TELL YOU HOW I MEASURE THE ECONOMY AND HOW WELL IT IS DOING. I MEASURE THE GREATNESS OF THE ECONOMY BASED ON HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW WERE WORKING PEOPLE DOING WHEN WORKING PEOPLE AND WORKING FAMILIES ARE DOING WELL IN THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WHICH IS WHY JOE BIDEN AND I ARE SAYING TAXES WILL NOT BE RAISED ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $40,000 YEAR. WE ARE SAYING THAT WE KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS THAT WE ACHIEVE ACCESS TO ECONOMIC HEALTH AND INTERGENERATIONAL PROSPERITY IS HOMEOWNERSHIP SO WE WILL HAVE A 15,000-DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS TO HELP YOU WITH DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COST TO BUY A HOME. WE UNDERSTAND WORKING FAMILIES NEED CHILDCARE BUT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. THAT IS OUR MESSAGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WHEN WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING WELL. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO MEASURES HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING BASED ON THE STOCK MARKET, WHO MEASURES HOW WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING BASED ON HOW RICH PEOPLE ARE DOING, WHO IS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS IS TO PASS A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. I WILL TELL YOU JOE BIDEN AND I WILL MAKE IT ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES TO GET RID OF THAT TAX BILL AND DO WHAT WE KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE, TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND AN ECONOMIC HEALTH CRISIS BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION. A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE COURAGE TO USE THE TERM AND SPEAK THOSE WORDS BLACK LIVES MATTER. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO REFUSES AND WILL NEVER SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THEN HAS THE GALL TO STAND ON THE DEBATE STAGE IN THE LAST DEBATE IN FRONT OF 70 MILLION AMERICANS AND WOULD NOT CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACIST. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME, THEY SAY WELL SENATOR HARRIS AND BY THE WAY CENTER , SENATOR IS NOT ALL MIGHT BIRTH CERTIFICATES, LOVE. THEY SAY ARE YOU SAYING YOU THINK HE'S A RACIST? YES. YES. BECAUSE YOU SEE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S SOME RANDOM ONE-OFF. WE HAVE SEEN THAT PATTERN GOING BACK AND QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF ROCCO PALMA AND GOING BACK TO CHARLOTTESVILLE WHEN PEOPLE WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA WHERE A WOMAN WAS KILLED AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF KNEE ON WEARING SWASTIKAS CARRYING TIKI TORCHES AND THROWING OUT ANTI-SEMITIC AND RACIST SLURS AND DONALD TRUMP SAYS THEY ARE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO REFERS TO MEXICANS AS RAPIST AND CRIMINALS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO MADE IT ONE OF HIS FIRST POLICY INITIATIVES AT BAM ON MUSLIMS ENTERING OUR COUNTRY. AND THEN STOOD ON THAT STAGE AND WOULD NOT CONDEMN NONE WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID WELL THEY SHOULD STAND BACK AND STAND BY. THIS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF WHO WE BELIEVE WE ARE AS A NATION. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO ACKNOWLEDGED AS SYSTEMIC RACISM, WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IS THE HISTORY OF AMERICA AND USES THAT HOLY PULPIT AND THAT MICROPHONE IN A WAY THAT SPEAKS WITH AN INTENTION TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES AND BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN. PUBLIC HEALTH, ECONOMICS, A GRAPPLING IN THE NEED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL INJUSTICE AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA BUT I WAS WORN IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW. THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN BURNING BECAUSE OF THOSE WILDFIRES. CALIFORNIA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON THE GULF STATES HAVE BEEN BATTERED. PEOPLE IN THE MIDWEST FARMERS LOSING CROPS BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO EMBRACE SCIENCE. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HURTING PEOPLE AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ADDRESS IN A WAY WE. JOBS BY INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTING IN BUILDING RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT'S ABOUT JOBS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEM FOR MENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES. HE KNOWS THAT OF ALL OF THE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN AMERICA WITH POOR AIR QUALITY, 70% OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. JOE BIDEN KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN FLINT. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO SCIENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO RECENTLY WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REPORT WAS SOMETIMES WE SAY IN THESE FIRES WAS HAPPENING AND THE SCIENTISTS SAY THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DRASTIC CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE IN THESE WILDFIRES. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN RESPONSE? HE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT? SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHAT WE SEE IS THE LINE ON THAT ISSUE IN THE FIRST ISSUE, AN INABILITY TO EMBRACE THE FACT, AN INABILITY TO EMBRACE EXPERTS IN INABILITY TO EMBRACE INTELLIGENCE, AN INABILITY TO BE COMPETENT, AN INABILITY TO DO THE JOB OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES WHOSE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. YOU ALL KNOW IN ATLANTA HELPS ME WHEN I RAN FOR SENATE AND I AM NOW THE ONLY BLACK WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, ONLY THE SECOND IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I'VE BEEN THERE NOW FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS. THE SENATE IS SO IMPORTANT ON ALL THESE ISSUES. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE. WE NEED TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE. THAT SENATORS THAT WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT ADVISE AND CONSENT ON WHO SITS ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. ONE OF THE REASONS I BECAME A LAWYER IS BECAUSE I WAS INSPIRED BY THURGOOD MARSHALL AND CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY, RIGHT? THEY ARE THE ONES WHO FOUGHT FOR BROWN ECO-BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO FOUGHT FOR SILVA WRITES AND WHO SITS ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. THE PRESIDENT NOMINATES SOMEONE IN THE SENATE WITH ADVISE AND CONSENT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER HE GOES THROUGH. RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING THAT BATTLE IN FULL WITH THIS ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN TO TRY TO FILL THE SEAT OF THE GREAT RUTH BADER GINSBURG WHILE PEOPLE ARE IN AN ELECTION AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY LET US DECIDE WHO WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT AND LET THAT PERSON DECIDE WHO FILLS THAT SEAT. THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS WHERE THERE WILL BE A DECISION ON WHETHER WE PUT ON THE FLOOR AT DELL THAT MY BROTHER CORY BOOKER FROM NEW JERSEY AND I WROTE CALLED THE JUSTICE AND POLICING ACT. A BILL THAT SAYS LIKE JOE BIDEN AND I SAY WE SHOULD BAN CHOKEHOLD AND CAROTID HOLDS BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I WERE THE CASE IN THE BILL THAT SAYS LET'S HAVE A NATIONAL REGISTRY FOR PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE CAN'T HAVE FOLKS GET FIRED ONE PLACE AND NOT GET HIRED SOMEPLACE ELSE. WE NEED TO HAVE A NATIONAL STANDARD FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT IN SOME PLACES WHEN THEIR SUCCESSIVE USE OF FORCE THE QUESTION ASKED IS WAS A REASONABLE WHEN WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN REASON AWAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. THE MORE FAIR AND JUST QUESTION TO ASK IS WHAT IS NECESSARY? WE NEED TO CHANGE THE STANDARD. THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS IF THEY GET MADE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE WILL MAKE THEM IT ALSO GETS MADE IN THE SENATE. THAT RINGS ME TO GROW WOOL WARNOCK AND JOHN OCTET. YOU'VE GOT TO SEND THEM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SEND THEM TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND LET THEM REPRESENT GEORGIA ON ALL THESE ISSUES. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW THOSE SENATE SEATS, THOSE ARE SIX-YEAR TERMS. THINK ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR YOUR LIFE AND FOR YOUR CHILDREN'S LIVES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SIX YEARS. THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN GET DONE EITHER FOR GOOD OR FOR KNOTS. THE SENATE IS SO IMPORTANT SO I'M HERE ATLANTA, GEORGIA TO ASK YOU TO DO WHAT I KNOW YOU ARE READY KNOW HOW TO DO SO WELL WHICH IS TO ORGANIZE, WHICH IS TO TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE AND TO REMIND PEOPLE ON THE ISSUE OF VOTING THAT WE HAVE GOT SO MANY REASONS. ONE HAS TO DO WITH AGAIN ATLANTA. IT HAS TO DO WITH JOHN LEWIS. IT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SHED BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTIS BRIDGE AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. SO VOTING IS ABOUT HONORING THOSE ANCESTORS, HONORING WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR AND WHAT THEY SACRIFICED FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. VOTING, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE. EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED, EVERYTHING THAT AFFECTS OUR LIVES AND VOTING ALSO IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE MESS WITH OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. BECAUSE HERE IS HOW I THINK ABOUT THAT. I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF A LOT OF TIME ALL OVER I'VE BEEN IN FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND I WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA THIS WEEKEND I WILL BE IN OHIO TOMORROW BUT THINK ABOUT IT FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. EVER SINCE AND EVEN BEFORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN 2013 AT WHOLE LOT OF REALLY POWERFUL PEOPLE INCLUDING IN THIS STATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNOR STACY. A WHOLE LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SUPPRESS OUR VOTE, HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PURGE THE VOTER ROLLS, HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT THE PROCESS, TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT. YOU CAN FILL OUT YOUR BALLOT IN PUT IT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND THEN YOU NEED TO PUT IT IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT SIGNED, TRYING TO CONFUSE US AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE POST OFFICE? LIKE THE POST MAN IN THE POST-WOMAN? THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. WE HAVE TO DO SOME POINTS IT BACK AND THINK WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? I THINK THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE WE WIN. SO I'M HERE TO SAY ATLANTA LETS NOT LET ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. WE KNOW THE POWER OF OUR BOYS. WE KNOW AT ELECTION TIME THE POWER OF OUR BOYS IS EXPRESSING OUR VOTE AND WE ARE GOING TO LET ANYBODY TAKE US OUT. WE ARE PRESENT, WE ARE POWERFUL, WE ARE ACTIVE AND WE KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE AND WE HONOR OUR ANCESTORS EVERY DAY. SO MY LAST POINT IS THIS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT TIME AND THE THING WE ARE OWING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM THERE WAS THIS ONE PARTICULAR AFTERNOON WE WERE HANGING OUT AT MOREHOUSE IN THE PARKING LOT. WE WILL TELL THEM WE ORGANIZED AND WE TALKED TO HER NEIGHBORS AND THEIR FRIENDS AND HER RELATIVES. WE WILL TELL THEM WE HELPED PEOPLE GET TO THE POLLS. WE WILL TELL THEM WE MADE SURE EVERYONE WE KNOW GOT TO THEIR COUNTY OFFICE TO VOTE. WE'LL TELL THAN WE STOOD UP AND WE FOUGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WE FOUGHT FOR THE IDEA BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WE KNOW OUR POWER. THANK YOU ATLANTA. .. [BACKGROUND SOUNDS].

STREAM OR ON AT C-SPAN.ORG OR LISTEN ON THE C-SPAN RADIO APP. YOUR PLACE FOR AN UNFILTERED VIEW OF POLITICS. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, ROBIN, FOR HOSTING ME TODAY, AND FOR THE WARM WELCOME. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A DEAR, DEAR FRIEND. AND SOMEBODY WHO IS A NATIONAL LEADER. WE ARE ALL THINKING OF HER THIS MORNING. THANK YOU ALL. AND EVERYBODY FROM YOUR CAR, YOUR HOME, WE ARE ALL TOGETHER. STANDING SIX FEET APART AND WEARING A MASK. LET'S ALWAYS REMEMBER, LET'S ALWAYS REMEMBER WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AND WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN AND WE ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WESO, I KNOW THIS IS NOT HOW WE USUALLY DO CHURCH, BUT IT IS A REMINDER, PASTOR, THAT FAITH ALWAYS FINDS ITS WAY, AND WE NEED TO ALWAYS FEEL THE GRACE OF GOD AND TO BE IN CHURCH, EVEN IF IT IS IN OUR CAR OR AT HOME. SO THAT IS WHAT WE DO. AND DON'T WE ALL ESPECIALLY NEED CHURCH RIGHT NOW? THE FEELING OF TOGETHERNESS THAT COMES FROM BEING A PART OF A COMMUNITY, A PLACE WHERE WE CAN EXPRESS OUR FIDELITY TO ONE ANOTHER AND OUR SERVICE TO ALL GOD'S CHILDREN. FOR ME, CHURCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH AND A PLACE FOR REFLECTION, A PLACE TO STUDY THE TEACHINGS OF OUR LORD AND A PLACE TO FEEL GROUNDED IN A WORLD THAT FEELS INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. AND, NEEDLESS TO SAY, HERE IN 2020, THE WORLD IS PLENTY COMPLEX, FROM THE PANDEMIC, TO THE RECESSION, TO HISTORIC WILDFIRES AND FLOODS. OF COURSE, THE LONG-OVERDUE RECOGNITION , RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. AND THINGS CERTAINLY ARE NOT EASY.RIGHT NOW SO MANY OF US ARE CARRYING BURDENS THAT ARE SEEN AND UNSEEN BY OTHERS. SO MANY OF US ARE SPENDING TIME IN REFLECTION AND PRAYER THESE DAYS. AND IN MY PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD, I USUALLY ASK FOR STRENGTH AND PROTECTION AND GUIDANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND THIS IS A TIME, INDEED, TO DRAW ON THE VALUES OF OUR FAITH , LOVINGKINDNESS, HONESTY, AND TRUTH, NOT ONLY AS INDIVIDUALS BUT AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A COUNTRY. WHEN HE STILL WAS A DOCTORAL STUDENT AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING TOLD A GROUP OF PARISHIONERS "THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT, THROUGH OUR SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, WE HAVE MADE THE WORLD A NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT, THROUGH OUR MORAL AND SPIRITUAL GENIUS, WE HAVE FAILED TO MAKE IT A BROTHERHOOD." SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT. WITH ALL THE CALLOUSNESS AND CRUELTY WE HAVE RECENTLY SEEN AROUND US, WOULD ANYONE DENY THAT DR. KING'S WORDS RING TRUE TODAY? WHEN BABIES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR MOTHERS, WHEN WE DESECRATE THE PLANET THAT GOD HAS ENTRUSTED TO US, WHEN, IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, WE ALLOW MILLIONS OF CHILDREN TO GO HUNGRY. WHEN WE FEAR FOR THE LIVES OF OUR BLACK BABIES AS THEY GROW SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. WE ARE ALL IN A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, AND ESPECIALLY EVERY COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK WHAT THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND A LAST FEW YEARS HAVE TAUGHT US IS THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HEED THE TEACHINGS OF DR. KING. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING OUR WORLD A BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD, THEN OUR FAITH CANNOT REMAIN JUST A MATTER OF PERSONAL SUSTENANCE. IT CANNOT BE ONLY ABOUT OUR PERSONAL NEEDS. OUR FAITH MUST PRESENT A CHALLENGE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE LIVE AMONG ENTRY OTHERS. OUR FAITH, AND I WAS RAISED THIS WAY, MUST BE A VERB. WE MUST LIVE IT IN OUR ACTIONS. GOD IS NOT GOING TO PUT IT IN YOUR LAP. SO THAT IS THE KIND OF FAITH I WAS TAUGHT EARLY ON, PASTOR, AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER SITTING WITH MY SISTER MAIA AND OUR , IN OUR SUNDAY BEST AND PRAISING THE WORD AND OUR LORD, BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN WE LEFT CHURCH WE WERE EXPECTED TO LIVE AND PUT IN ACTION THE TEACHINGS. AND MY EARLIEST MEMORIES OF THE BIBLE'S TEACHING WERE OF A LOVING GOD, I GOT WHO ASKS US TO STAND UP AND SERVE FOR OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED , THE LEAST OF THESE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOMS OF POWER, BUT BELONG IN THOSE ROOMS. OUR LOVING GOD WANTS US TO SPEAK UP FOR THE VOICELESS, CARE FOR THE NEEDY, AND SEEK JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED. HE ASKS US TO SEE EACH OTHER AS HE SEES US. IN FACT, IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES, WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE GREETING IS NOT PLEASED TO MEET YOU. THE GREETING IS ICU. ICU. , I SEE YOU. I DO BELIEVE GOD WANTS FOR US TO SEE EACH OTHER AND AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE OUR FAITH. AND EVEN IN THIS MOMENT OF TRIAL AND TESTING, AS I LOOK OUT AT THIS CONGREGATION, I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE RISING TO THIS MOMENT. I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE FILLED WITH STRENGTH AND WITH PURPOSE , HEALTH CARE WORKERS, TEACHERS. PEOPLE WHO KNOW IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS REAL LEADERS STEP UP AND FIGURE OUT THEIR PLACE TO SUPPORT AND TO HELP OTHERS. WE MUST LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR NEIGHBORS , UNDERSTANDING, THEN, , AND UNDERSTANDING, THEN, THAT IF WE ARE TO LIVE GOD'S PURPOSE FOR US, WE MUST SEE THAT PERSON ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND IN THEIR FACE, SEE A NEIGHBOR. SO, LET US REJOICE IN THE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS WHO, LIVING THAT WORD, SWARMED TO AIRPORTS TO PROTEST THE BAN AGAINST OUR MUSLIM BROTHERS AND SISTERS. LET US CELEBRATE WITH PEOPLE OF ALL RACES WHO TOOK TO THE STREETS TO SAY, YES, BLACK LIVES MATTER. IF PEOPLE, WHO HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS WHEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE AND OBAMACARE AND HAVE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY SAYING, SEE MY CHILD AND UNDERSTAND TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR IS TO LOVE MY CHILD AND UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHT TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THIS IS HOW PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP AND SPEAKING OUT ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. AND SO, YES, AS DR. KING SAID, OUR MORAL GENIUS MAY BE LAGGING BEHIND OUR SCIENTIFIC GENIUS, NDS, WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BUILD THAT BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD, TO BUILD THAT COMMUNITY, AND YET WE WILL GET THERE. WE ARE GETTING THERE. AND WE WILL GET THERE. SO LONG AS WE KEEP WORKING AND FIGHTING FOR THE IDEALS WE HOLD DEAR, BORN OUT OF OUR FAITH, SO LONG AS WE KEEP REJECTING THE FORCES THAT WOULD DIVIDE US, AND SO LONG AS WE KEEP DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY, AND DRAWING CLOSER TOGETHER, EVEN FROM A DISTANCE. AND SO LONG AS WE KEEP HOLDING ON TO OUR FAITH. SO THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR WELCOMING ME TODAY. PASTOR, THANK YOU, AND THE FIRST FAMILY, FOR ALL THE LOVE YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AND THIS COMMUNITY, AND THANK YOU , EVERYONE, FOR YOUR PRAYERS. I FEEL THEM EVERY DAY. GOD BLESS.

Senator Harris talked about the struggles of Americans through the coronavirus pandemic, and said she believes the U.S. could emerge from the situation stronger with the right leadership. Her visit to the church was part of a four-stop swing through the Detroit-area with just more than a week left before Election Day. She and her 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were seeking to shore up support at the polls from voters in Michigan, which supported President Trump in the 2016 election by a margin of just more than 10,000 votes.	477350-1	Speech

THANK YOU ALL FOR THE TIME AND ENERGY AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND PEOPLE SAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION? I SAID LOOK, HERE IS WHAT I TRULY BELIEVE. WE HAVE TAKEN A BATTERING. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, OVER THESE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. OUR DEMOCRACY , THE , THE SHINGLES HAVE FALLEN OUT A BIT. THE HOUSE IS STILL STANDING. I DO BELIEVE OUR DEMOCRACY WILL ALWAYS BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS AND PREPAREDNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. [APPLAUSE] AND FIGHT WE WILL BECAUSE LOOK AT WHAT I AM LOOKING AT. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF FOLKS OVER THERE , BECAUSE WE HAD TO SOCIALLY DISTANT, WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER THERE TOO. I HAVE BEEN GOING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THESE LAST 10 DAYS OR SO, VISITING WITH FOLKS EARLY VOTING IN HERE IN NEVADA, UNTIL FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30. LET'S MAKE SURE EVERYONE VOTES AND VOTE EARLY. GET IT DONE AND GET IT IN. PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINE AND THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY. IT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. THIS IS OUR COUNTRY AND WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT FOR IT. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE. AND LOOK, THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. I DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AT LEAST FOUR CRAZIES THAT ARE HAPPENING ALL AT THIS E-FOUR CRISES , FOUR CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. A PANDEMIC HAS CREATED MASS CASUALTY WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 225,000 AMERICANS WHO JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE DIED. MANY OF WHOM WERE WITHOUT A LOVED ONE NEXT TO THEM BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS. MANY OF WHOM , THE FAMILY WAS HOPING AT LEAST THEY COULD FACE TIME OR SEE EACH OTHER VIRTUALLY FOR THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH. PEOPLE ARE MOURNING. OVER 8.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS WITH UNKNOWN LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. THE THING IS IS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW NEW BACK , WE KNOW KNEW BACK ON JANUARY 28 IT IS LEGAL, 5 , IT IS LETHAL, FIVE TIMES AS DEADLY AS THE FLU, THAT IT CAN HARM YOUNG PEOPLE, THAT IT IS AIRBORNE AND THEY SAT ON THE INFORMATION AND HAD THE GA,L, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAT ON THAT INFORMATION AND CALLED IT A HOAX. CAN YOU GUYS IMAGINE IF YOU HAD KNOWN , IF PARENTS HAD KNOWN, IF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAD KNOWN, IF TEACHERS HAD KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT JANUARY 28 , WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN. LET'S NOT FORGET BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, FOLKS WERE HURTING. EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS WERE HURTING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PAY. THE BILLS IN THE AMERICA JOE BIDEN AND I BELIEVE IN, PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. [APPLAUSE] PEOPLE WERE HURTING ALREADY. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY WAS STRUGGLING TO HAVE MAYBE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? NOT TO MENTION BUY TOILET PAPER? RIGHT? AND THEY SAT ON THIS INFORMATION. AND NOW, IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BOY, BILL BARR, OR IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT , ARE IN THE UNITED STATE SUPREME COURT. I VOTED NO ON THAT CONFIRMATION BY THE WAY. THEY ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW SUING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS, THAT SAID PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT BE DENIED ACCESS TO COVERAGE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, CANCER, LUPUS. DO YOU KNOW OVER ONE MILLION NEVADANS HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? THEY ARE IN COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND IT JUST , IT IS A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO THIS PERSON IS. THIS PRESIDENT WHO IN THE MIDST OF THE KIND OF SUFFERING WE ARE SEEING HAS , IS CONTINUING WITH THIS VERY WEIRD OBSESSION HE HAS HAD SINCE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT TO UNDO WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA CREATED. IT IS A WEIRD OBSESSION BY THE WAY. WE DO NOT NEED A PRESIDENT WITH WEIRD OBSESSIONS. LET'S MOVE BEYOND THAT THING TOO. RIGHT? WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHERE OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. HERE IN NEVADA, ONE IN SEVEN FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. I SAW NUMBERS THAT ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IS DESCRIBING THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS BEING HUNGRY. IN NEVADA, WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS WERE FINDING IT DIFFICULT , THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY RENT. IN NEVADA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESSES AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE, ALMOST HALF OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE RUNS OR WORKS FOR A SMALL BUSINESS. . THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION IS PROFOUND. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP , EVEN IN THE LAST DEBATE HE IS TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE ROUNDING THE CORNER. WHAT IS HE SAYING? ROUNDING THE CORNER WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE AGAIN AND A CLEAR DIFFERENCE ON ALL THESE ISSUES. ON PUBLIC HEALTH, JOE BIDEN IS SAYING LET'S EXPAND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BARACK OBAMA AND I BROUGHT INTO BEING. LET'S BRING DOWN MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO AGE 60. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS AND JOB PRICES. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP, MENTAL HEALTH CARE. LET'S EXTEND THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ON THE ECONOMY, JOE BIDEN SAYS, YOU WANT TO ASK ME ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, TELL ME HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. JOE BIDEN SAYS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. AND YES, WE ARE GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, WE ALSO KNOW THAT IS THE MINIMUM AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF INNOVATION AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTING IN GOOD UNION PAYING JOBS TO BUILD UP A MIDDLE-CLASS IN AMERICA. , BUILD UP THE MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA. THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO WHEN ASKED HOW IS THE ECONOMY DOING, HE ASKED HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? HOW ARE WHICH PEOPLE DOING? HE PASSES AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA. JOE BIDEN AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT. [APPLAUSE] AND INVEST IN THAT MONEY IN WORKING PEOPLE IN AMERICA. PUT THAT MONEY INTO BUILDING UP OUR SKILLS, PUT THAT MONEY INTO SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY CAN REOPEN AND REHIRE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A LONG, OVERDUE RECKONING ON THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO KNOWS AND HAS LEARNED AND STUDIED AMERICA'S HISTORY AND HAS THEREFORE THE COURAGE TO SAY, BLACK LIVES MATTER. [APPLAUSE] A TERM DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER USE. WILL NEVER USE. JOE BIDEN SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES. LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS IN LET US DEAL WITH THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP, WHERE WE KNOW BLACK FAMILIES OWN 1/10 OF THE WEALTH OF OTHER FAMILIES. LET'S DO WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, UNDERSTANDING BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE OR FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDCARE THAN OTHER WOMEN. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE ARE GOING TO REFORM THESE SYSTEMS, INCLUDING CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND IN SO DOING WE WILL DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE RECORDS OF PEOPLE CONVICTED OF MARIJUANA OFFENSES. WE WILL SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS BECAUSE THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS HUMAN BEINGS MAKING MONEY OFF THE INCARCERATION OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO REFORM POLICING TO ACQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN A POLICE OFFICER BREAKS THE LAW. AT FOR THAT REASON, WE WILL BAN CAROTID HOLD'S AND CHOKEHOLDS, BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY, AND WE WILL REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND CREATING A NATIONAL SYSTEM AROUND TRACKING THOSE WHO WROTE THE LAW SO THEY WON'T GET FIRED IN ONE PLACE, AND HIRED IN ANOTHER. [APPLAUSE] ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, REMEMBER, AT THE LAST DEBATE, FOR THIS MOST RECENT ONE, REFUSED TO CONDEMN THE WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP, AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID, STAND BACK AND STAND BY. THAT ON THE HEELS OF WAY BACK WHEN, BECAUSE THERE IS A PATTERN , ON THE ISSUE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE AMERICANS WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED AT THAT . AND ON THE OTHERS, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, AND HE HAD CALLED SAY FIND PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, TO CALL MEXICANS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS, HAD ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS A MUSLIM BAND. AND YOU SEE THIS ON THIS LIST IS VERY CLEAR CONTRAST, ANOTHER OF THOSE ISSUES BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT IS OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT FOR A JOE BIDEN THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, GENDER, AGE, OR THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US, AND IT IS TIME TO END A SUPPOSEDLY TO WHO IS SPENDING FULL TIME TRYING TO SEW HATE AND DIVISION AMONG US. WE WANT A UNIFIER. THAT IS WHY WE WANT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE LIST OF CRISES, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL RENO, THE CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU GUYS KNOW IT, YOU GUYS ARE LIVING IT. WE ARE SEEING WILDFIRES THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST. I HAVE VISITED MANY OF THEM. I HAVE VISITED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD TO BE EVACUATED. I HAVE VISITED WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. WE SEE IT IN THE GULF COAST STATES, STORMS THAT ARE BATTERING WHOLE COMMUNITIES, IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED THE FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. AND JOE BIDEN SAYS, WE HAVE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO SCIENCE, AND DO IT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, AND PUT TIMELINES IN PLACE. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON THIS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND JOE SAYS, I ALSO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MOMENT TO SAVE OUR PLANET, WHICH ALSO WILL ALLOW US, IF WE ARE SERIOUS, TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE, RENEWABLE ENERGY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SAVE OUR PLANET, SAVE WATER, SAVE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. JOE SEES THIS IS ABOUT LETTING UP THE ECONOMY AND JOBS AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. HE GETS ASKED BY SOME JOURNALIST ABOUT THE WILDFIRES, AND THE JOURNALIST ASKS SOMETHING LIKE, THE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE CAUSING THIS TO HAPPEN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPONDS TO THE QUESTION BY SAYING SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS. [LAUGHTER] SCIENCE KNOWS. [APPLAUSE] AND WE KNOW. AND WE KNOW IT IS TIME TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AND STOP PLAYING INTO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS YOU HAVE BEEN COURTING SINCE YOU CAME INTO OFFICE. SO THESE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW, AND THERE ARE CLEAR CHOICES. THERE ARE CLEAR CHOICES, AND WE HAVE IN OUR POWER THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE FUTURE COURSE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER. THIS BRINGS ME TO NEVADA, AND WHY I WILL KEEP COMING BACK. YOU GUYS KNOW. IT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE. NEVADA IS GOING TO HELP DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. [APPLAUSE] YOU ARE. YOU ARE. AND IN THAT WAY, YOUR VOTE IS GOING TO IMPACT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE YOU MAY NEVER MEET, PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAME. BUT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE SO POWERFUL IN YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT, YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND ONE THING THAT HAS BECOME CLEAR IS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY, IS MY VOTE GOING TO MATTER, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? THERE ARE THREE REASONS. ONE IS TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] THIS YEAR WE LOST THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT OF BLACK AMERICANS TO VOTE. HE SHED HIS BLOOD. THE OTHER THING ABOUT JOHN LE WS, , JOHN LEWIS TO SHOW UP AND SAY, MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS A CORE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SAY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IMMIGRATION AND CREATE A PATHWAY AND STOP DEMONIZING IMMIGRANTS IN AMERICA. JOHN LEWIS, HE AND SO MANY OTHERS SHED THAT BLOOD. WE SHOULD HONOR THAT SACRIFICE. THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATE IT, THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE BADASS SUFFRAGETTES. THERE ARE CHILDREN HERE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S OK, THE MOMS SAID IT WAS OK. ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO MARCHED, WHO COULDN'T HEAR NO, WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. AND WE MUST BE TRUE TO HISTORY AND THE FACTS, THAT BLACK WOMEN WERE NOT ABLE TO VOTE UNTIL 1965. SO LET'S REMEMBER THAT, BUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS IS AN IMPORTANT REASON TO VOTE. TWO, EVERYTHING THAT IS AT STAKE. WE WENT THROUGH THE LIST, AND THERE IS SO MUCH MORE. SOME SAY THAT I VOTED AGAINST HER, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN , I VOTED AGAINST HER, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING. WE ARE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT ELECTION SEASON OR ELECTION YEAR. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VOT , HAVE VOTED. I THINK THE LAST NUMBER I SAW WAS 50 MILLION PEOPLE HAD VOTED WHEN THE CONFIRMATION WENT DOWN LAST NIGHT. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING, LET US CHOOSE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND LET THAT PERSON CHOOSE WHO WILL FILL A LIFETIME SEAT ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND, THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY THE GREAT RUTH BADER GINSBURG. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. RUTH BADER GINSBURG, WE ALWAYS SHOULD SPEAK HER NAME. WHAT SHE DID, I THINK THERE WAS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HER SIZE AND HER FORCE. WHAT SHE DID FOR EQUALITY AND WOMEN. AND NOW, THERE IS SOMEONE ON THE COURT WHO MANY OF US OPPOSED ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE HAS A TRACK RECORD THAT IT MAKES IT CLEAR SHE WAS TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. KEEP IN MIND, IN SO DOING, IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AMONG THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT, OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WITH ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BEING PROTECTED. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WILL BE AT STAKE? FREE BIRTH CONTROL. FREE MAMMOGRAMS. FREE CANCER SCREENINGS. [APPLAUSE] ALL OF THAT IS AT STAKE, NOT TO MENTION A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. SO WE HONOR THE ANCESTORS. WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AT HERE IS THE THIRD REASON IT 'S IMPORTANCE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF , AND HERE'S THE THIRD REASON IS T IS IMPORTANT TO VOTE. THE SUPREME COURT TOOK OUT THE TEETH OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND ALL MUST IMMEDIATELY AFTER, TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN LAWS DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE, PEOPLE OF COLOR AND STUDENTS. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA REVIEWED WHAT THEY DID, THEY SAID THE STATE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED THE LAW WITH SURGICAL PROVISION , SURGICAL PRECISION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BLACK VOTERS IN THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA TO VOTE. MY POINT IS THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASK A QUESTION, WHICH IS, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT VOTING? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT WE CAN'T TRUST THE SYSTEM? WHY ARE THEY MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE? THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE. AND ONE MUST ASK, WHY ARE THEY GOING THROUGH SUCH AN EFFORT? HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. [APPLAUSE] THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. [APPLAUSE] SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. IT IS OUR POWER TO STAND IN THOSE LINES AS LONG AS NECESSARY. WE WILL BRING OUR FRIENDS WITH US AND HAVE A GOOD OLD TIME. BUT WE KNOW OUR POWER, AND WE ARE PREPARED TO EXERCISE THE POWER OF OUR VOICE THAT COMES WITH ELECTION TIME, THROUGH OUR VOTE. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE, AND WE KNOW THE SHOULDERS WE STAND UPON, THAT CAME GENERATIONS BEFORE US, THAT WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS. [APPLAUSE] MY LAST POINT IS THIS. YEARS FROM NOW, BECAUSE THIS MOMENT WILL HAVE PASSED, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK AT US, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM THAT WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY AT THE AMPHITHEATER IN RENO WITH KAMALA AND ALL OUR FRIENDS, WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM WE TEXTED AND CALLED AND EMAILED EVERYONE WE KNEW, REPEATEDLY UNTIL THEY GOT SICK OF US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD COME BACK TO US EVENTUALLY, BUT WE DID WHATEVER WAS NECESSARY TO REMIND PEOPLE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE, TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR POWER, AND TO REMIND THEM THAT OURS IS A COUNTRY WE ARE FIGHTING FOR BECAUSE WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, RENO, AND THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

CSPANKH2810202030	Kamala Harris	2020-10-28	Senator Kamala Harris Speaks at Biden Campaign Event in Tucson, Arizona	WHAT'S UP, TUCSON? HEY, EVERYBODY. CAN WE PLEASE HERE FOR MAYOR ROMERO? SHE IS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND PASSION AND SHE REPRESENTS WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE EVERYTHING YOU DO. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN ARIZONA. YOU GUYS MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU GUYS WILL ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. YOU WILL DO THAT. [HORNS HONKING] I WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR HOSTING THIS. THE STUDENTS, THE CONGRESSMAN, THERE YOU ARE. CONGRESSWOMAN ANN KIRKPATRICK. GABBY GIFFORD AND MARK KELLY. [HORNS HONKING] LET'S GET THIS DONE. HERE'S THE THING. FIRST OF ALL, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LATE GREAT JOHN MCCAIN, I WAS THINKING LET'S START WITH SOME STRAIGHT TALK. THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK ABOUT MY VALUES. LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I AM A PROUD PATRIOTIC AMERICAN. I LOVE MY COUNTRY. [HORNS HONKING] OUR VALUES REFLECT THE VALUES OF AMERICA. OUR VALUES TELL US WE HAVE WITNESSED THE WORST, THE BIGGEST DISASTER OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. OUR VALUES TELL US THAT. OUR VALUES TELL US THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE IN A MOMENT WHERE OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN OUR COUNTRY. OVER 8.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED A VIRUS. WHEN WE GOT THE INFORMATION, WE HAVE KNOWN HOW SERIOUS FTHIS IS. THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT A FEW OF THE THINGS WE KNOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF FOUR CRISES HAPPENING AT ONCE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC. A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC THAT LIKE I SAID, HAS CAUSED OVER 225,000 AMERICANS TO DIE. MANY OF WHOM DIED WITHOUT ANY FAMILY MEMBERS BEING ABLE TO BE WITH THEM TO HOLD HER HAND, TO LOOK IN THEIR EYES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE VIRUS. OVER 8.5 MILLION AMERICANS WHO NOW HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE OF VIRUS. THE TRAGEDY OF IT IS THIS. IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. IT LITERALLY DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THANKS TO A FELLOW BY THEM , NAME OF BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PANDEMIC. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL KILL PEOPLE. HE WAS TOLD IT IS FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL HURT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT WAS AIRBORNE. AND HE SAT ON THE INFORMATION. HE DID NOT TELL YOU. CAN YOU IMAGINE AS A PARENT, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, AS A WORKING PERSON IF ON JANUARY 28, YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO? TO PLAN? TO PREPARE? KNOWING THAT EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, SO MANY AMERICANS WERE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE? KNOWING THAT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, MOST AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE MORE THAN $1000 LIFE SAVINGS? WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO PREPARE? WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE TO PREPARE YOUR CHILDREN FOR THE FACT THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL TOO BACK-TO-SCHOOL? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IF YOU RUN A SMALL BUSINESS? TO PUT IN PLACE PROVISIONS FOR THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF BUSINESS FOR MONTHS? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO BUY SOME EXTRA TOILET PAPER? [HORNS HONKING] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LIED TO BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALSO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO HAS AS HIS HIGHEST RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ON THAT COUNT, DONALD TRUMP FAILED. HE FAILED US. [HORNS HONKING] HE FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HERE'S THE THING. YOU KNOW THIS. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION ON THIS MATTER. YOU SEE, ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. WHO IS SAYING THAT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE OF THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD. JOE BIDEN WHO TOGETHER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE. WHO SAID WE PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HONK IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WITH DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH BREAST CANCER. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] JOE SAID WE WILL PROTECT YOU AND THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. JOE SAYS IF WE WIN, WE'RE GOING TO GET IN THERE AND EXPAND COVERAGE. WE'RE GOING TO BRING DOWN ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE TO AGE 60. WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PREMIUMS. JOE SAYS WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE BODY DOESN'T JUST START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT ALSO REQUIRES HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. THE CHOICE BEFORE US IN SIX DAYS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP WHO TOGETHER WITH HIS BOY BILL BARR ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOW SUING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IF THEY HAVE THEIR WAY, OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE COVERAGE AND THE BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE OVER. LET'S UNDERSTAND, PART OF WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID IS IT SAID FOR WOMEN, FREE MAMMOGRAMS FOR ALL PEOPLE, FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR CANCER. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THAT. THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. NOT TO MENTION WHAT THEY DID TO RAM THROUGH A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BECAUSE OF THEIR AGENDA TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. I VOTED NO. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] IT WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE PROCESS. HERE'S THE THING ABOUT WHERE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING THE SAME THING. FROM THE TIME DONALD TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE THROUGH THE TIME HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE, HE HAS HAD THIS WEIRD OBSESSION WITH TRYING TO GET RID OF WHATEVER BARACK OBAMA AND JOE BIDEN CREATED. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT? WE DON'T NEED PRESIDENTS WITH WEIRD OBSESSIONS. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO END. DO YOU AGREE? [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IS BEING COMPARED TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN 10 HOUSEHOLDS ARE DESCRIBING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA. PEOPLE ARE COVERING THAT ENOUGH. I SEE NUMBERS ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS BEING HUNGRY. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS IS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING RENT OR WERE UNABLE TO PAY RENT LAST MONTH. HERE IN ARIZONA, ONE IN FOUR BUSINESSES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, THEN YOU NEED TO TELL ME. HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMY, THEN WE WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 PER YEAR. WE WILL ALSO CUT TAXES FOR MIDDLE-CLASS WORKING PEOPLE. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT NO WORKING FAMILY PAYS MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. WE WILL HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS. UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THE WAY AND ACCESS FOR MOST FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING THAT IS INTERGENERATIONAL. THAT'S HOW JOE BIDEN THINKS ABOUT THE ECONOMY. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP, WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, DONALD TRUMP ASKS HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? DONALD TRUMP ASKS HOW HER RICH PEOPLE DOING? DONALD TRUMP, AS HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, PASSED A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA. CREATING A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT FOR ALL OF US. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, WHEN JOE AND I ARE ELECTED, WE ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT IS ABOUT THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF JOBS. WE WILL PUT THAT MONEY INTO AN INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT WILL DO THAT WILL NOT ONLY SAVE OUR PLANET, BUT CREATE JOBS. WILL PUT THAT MONEY TO RELIEVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR ANY KID COMING FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $105,000 AND ASSURE THEY GO TO A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE FOR FREE. THAT IS WHAT JOE AND I WILL DO. [HORNS HONKING] [HORNS HONKING] ON THAT NOTE, JOE BIDEN KNOWS AMERICANS HISTORY. HE KNOWS OUR HISTORY AS A COUNTRY. HE HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT IT. JOE BIDEN HAS THE ABILITY TO SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER. [HORNS HONKING] DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER SPEAK THOSE WORDS. JOE BIDEN KNOWS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN AMERICA. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT COVID AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM ERIE IT JOE BIDEN KNOWS OUR INDIGENOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN AMERICA. JOE BIDEN SAYS PAY ATTENTION TO THIS AND UNDERSTAND, A REAL LEADER WILL ADDRESS THE TRUTH AND SPEAK THE TRUTH IN A WAY THAT IS ABOUT PROMOTING EQUALITY AND EQUITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WAS ON THE DEBATE STAGE AT THE FIRST DEBATE AND REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS. THEN DOUBLE DOWN SAYING STAND BACK AND STAND BY. DONALD TRUMP, WHO IS SHOWN A PATTERN FROM THE FIRST DAYS HE WAS RUNNING AND QUESTIONED THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. DONALD TRUMP, WHO WENT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS WERE PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED, AND ON THE OTHER, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS AND CARRYING TIKI TORCHES SPEWING ANTI-SEMITIC AND RACIAL SLURS, DONALD TRUMP SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON EACH SIDE. HE CAME INTO OFFICE TALKING ABOUT MEXICANS AS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS TO PASS A MUSLIM BAN. THERE IS A REAL CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE JOE BIDEN AND I UNDERSTAND AMERICA DESERVE SO MUCH MORE. WE WANT A LEADER WHO IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO SO HATE AND INDECISION. WE KNOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF ANY HUMAN BEING IS NOT ABOUT WHO YOU BEAT DOWN, IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU LIFT UP. [HORNS HONKING] THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADER JOE IS. THE CRISES WE ARE FACING, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL ARIZONA THIS, IT INCLUDES A CLIMATE CRISIS. THE WEST COAST HAS BEEN BURNING. THESE WILDFIRES, AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE GONE , I AM FROM CALIFORNIA. I HAVE VISITED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. MY BROTHER IS A FIREFIGHTER. I HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION. THE DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION IN OUR GULF COAST STATES BECAUSE OF THE STORM THAT IS WIPED OUT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. IN THE MIDWEST, FARMERS HAVE LOST WHOLE SEASONS OF CROPS BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS. JOE BIDEN SAYS LET'S DEAL WITH THIS. LET'S FACE FACTS, LET'S EMBRACE SCIENCE. LET US DO IT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND ALSO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO SET TIME LIMITS. NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO SET GOALS THAT INCLUDE AN INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND YES WHAT, THAT'S ABOUT JOBS. MILLIONS OF JOBS. [HORNS HONKING] ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES, SOMEONE ASKED HIM SAYING SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE WILDFIRES. WILL YOU ADDRESS THAT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HIS UTTER ELOQUENCE SAYS SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REFERRED TO SCIENCE AS A PERSON. [LAUGHTER] [HORNS HONKING] 1 WEEK , WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO EMBRACES FACT AND DEALS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH A THREAT THAT IS THE GREATEST TO US AS A SPECIES. THESE ARE THE THREATS AND CRISES WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THEM. IT BRINGS ME TO WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ACROSS AMERICA. A PROCESS THAT WILL END IN SIX DAYS. THAT IS THE SELECTION. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT EVERYTHING IS IN EACH OF OUR HANDS. IN TERMS OF THE POWER WE POSSESS THROUGH OUR VOTE AND OUR ACTION TO DETERMINE WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [HORNS HONKING] PEOPLE ASK, THEY SAY DOES IT MATTER IF I VOTE? WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I WILL TELL YOU TUCSON, I MENTIONED THREE THINGS IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION. NUMBER ONE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO VOTE TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. ALL OF THIS PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT, WHO MARCHED, FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. THIS YEAR, WE LOST GREAT JOHN LEWIS, A GREAT AMERICAN WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE TOGETHER WITH SO MANY OTHERS. JOHN LEWIS WAS SUCH A FIGHTER FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. HE UNDERSTOOD THE ONGOING FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS NOT ONLY DID HE SHED BLOOD FIGHTING FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO VOTE IN THE SOUTH AND AROUND OUR COUNTRY, IT WAS JOHN LEWIS WHO WAS ALWAYS AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE SAYING THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS A FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS A FIGHT FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT IS FOR EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. IT IS ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS. THOSE WHO SACRIFICED SO MUCH. IT'S ABOUT HONORING THE ANCESTORS KNOWING THAT THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATED THE PASSAGE OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT WHICH GAVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. [HORNS HONKING] HONORING THE SUFFRAGETTES WHO WERE MARCHING AND FIGHTING AND SAYING WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED, WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. HONORING THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS STEAK. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. YOU GO DOWN THE LIST. EVERYTHING THAT IMPACTS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY. FROM HEALTH CARE TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS THAT KIND OF APPROACH THAT HAS BUILT THE MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA AND MADE US STRONG WHEN WE HAVE BEEN STRONG. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WHEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT EMBRACES THE FACT THAT WE ARE A NATION BUILT IN LARGE PART BY IMMIGRANTS AND WE MUST CREATE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND HONOR AMERICA'S PARTNERSHIP TO THE DREAMERS AND RENEW DACA. [HORNS HONKING] EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WHETHER WE ARE GOING STAKE. WHETHER WE WILL EMBRACE SCIENCE AND DEAL CHANGE IN CLIMATE. WHETHER WE CARE ABOUT OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD AND WHETHER WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NEVER TAKE THE WORD FOREIGN DICTATOR OVER THE WORD OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. , INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE VOTE TO HONOR ANCESTORS, VOTE BECAUSE WE KNOW SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. AND HERE IS THE THIRD REASON I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO VOTE, AND IT IS THIS. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER. I HAVE BEEN IN FLORIDA, MICHIGAN, OHIO, GEORGIA, NORTH CAROLINA. I'M GOING TO HEAD TO TEXAS AND I HAVE BEEN ALL OVER. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF POWERFUL FOLKS TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OTHER FOLKS ABOUT AND IN 2013, THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND RIGHT AFTER THERE WERE A COUPLE STATES THAT PUT INTO PLACE LAWS THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT LAWS PURGING THE VOTER ROLLS AND WE HAVE PEOPLE IN POWERFUL POSITIONS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO OPENLY ENCOURAGED SUPPRESSION OF THE VOTE. PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT CONFUSING. YOU GOTTA FILL OUT THIS ENVELOPE AND PUT IT OUT ON THAT ENVELOPE. PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT ARE PULLING AWAY FROM BOXES TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT, SHUTTING DOWN POLLING SITES AND WE HAVE TO ASK , WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO CONFUSE US? WHY IS THE PRESIDENT MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE? AND HERE IS THE ANSWER, BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER, THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY NOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY NOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. AND SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. OURS IS THE POWER, SO USE OUR VOICES, AND AT ELECTION TIME, THAT MEANS OUR VOTE AND LET'S NOT LET ANYONE TAKE IT FROM US. BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING, OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE WILL DO. AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE OF US VOTING TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND THEN MY FINAL POINT IS THIS THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL ASK US WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM IS WHAT WE DID. WHAT WE DID. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM HOW WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS ONE AFTERNOON. WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM THAT WE ORGANIZED FOR US, THAT WE LEAD OUR NEIGHBORS FRIENDS, COWORKERS AND FAMILY KNOW WHAT IS AT STAKE. HE REMINDED THEM OF THE SACRIFICES OF THE ANCESTORS, WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE POWER. YES, HAVE BEEN IN A PANDEMIC WHERE THERE IS SOME ISOLATION GOING ON BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE, WE REMINDED THEM THEY ARE NOT ALONE, WE REMINDED THEM DON'T LET ANYBODY MAKE YOU FEEL SMALL. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE KNEW WE WERE A COMMUNITY. WE KNEW THAT THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION IS BASED ON OUR UNITY. WE WILL TELL THEM WE FOUGHT KNOWING THAT WE ALL, REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE LIVED, WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE KNEW WE HAD SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND WE WOULD NOT LET ANYONE DIVIDE ASSASSINATION. WE WOULD NOT LET ANYONE BREAK OUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR STRENGTH AND HUMANITY AND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM. AND WE WILL TELL THEM THAT'S HOW WE ELECT TO JOE BIDEN, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, TO SOME. , TUCSON. THANK YOU.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477473-1/senator-kamala-harris-speaks-biden-campaign-event-tucson-arizona	2020 vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke at a campaign event in Tucson, Arizona.	477473-1	Speech
CSPANKH2810202031	Kamala Harris	2020-10-28	Senator Harris Biden Campaign Event in Phoenix, Arizona	Uh, Alicia Keys. Honestly, I just want to say something. Alicia Keys. I've known her for a long time, and the thing is that she is she has a gift. We all know that she has a gift. She has an incredible voice. She is a just such an incredible talent as a musician, as a writer. And she always, on top of all of that, shows up and shows up for our country, shows up on issues and does it with incredible courage, but always truth speaking. And we have to applaud an artist with the gift that she has, who does it all and does it all always with grace and with conviction. Can we again give it up for Alicia Keys? Can you hook for Alicia Keys? Well, it is so good to be in Phoenix. What's up, Phoenix? It's so good to be here. It's so good to be back. I was just here. Actually, Joe and I came to Phoenix the day after that debate I had with Mike Pence. So it's good to be back in Phoenix. And I wanna thank Ruben Gallego, the most incredible congressman. He is a friend. He is a leader for Arizona. He is a national leader. Please give it up for Ruben Gallego and Congressman Greg Stanton again, a great leader who was a leader always fighting for the people of the state he rolled to Borini. She is going to get this done. Candidate for Arizona. Six. Phoenix mayor can't Diego. Thank you. What a powerhouse! So it's This is a good time. This is a good time. Six days to go. And like Alicia said, we are here joyful, knowing what is at stake and we understand than in fighting for all of the issues that will be determined based on the outcome of this election, we can work hard while still enjoying some good music, dancing a good dance bop in our head, knowing that with joy and optimism, we fight for the things we believe in. This is not a fight against anything. This is a joyful fight for what we know can be unburdened by what has been. That's what's before us. That is what is before us, Phoenix And I'll tell you in the in the spirit of the late, great John McCain, I'm here to also engage in a little straight talk because I'll tell you, you know, for example, you know there's been there's been a lot of talk from the current occupant of the White House about my values. Well, let me just tell you, in the spirit of John McCain, I am a proud, patriotic American. It was very clear thinking about the values we as Americans share when it comes to knowing that the commander in chief of the United States of America should have as his first priority the health and well being of the American people. I am clear in understanding. This is the greatest failure of any presidential administration we have ever witnessed as a country. And I know that we are all prepared to stand for the democracy of our country and to stand for this country we love, and the challenges are there great. We are facing right now probably four crises that have converged at one time because of this pandemic, we're looking at a public health crisis. That is what I've been calling one of the greatest mass casualty events we have experienced designation since World War two. We're looking at over 225,000 people who have died in just the last several months, many of whom, because of the nature of this pandemic, were with out their family members for their last minutes and hours on this earth. We're looking at a public health crisis where a virus has infected over 8.5 million Americans who are going to face unknown long term health consequences, including what? Including what doctors are telling us lung scarring and things of that nature. And I bring this up and these numbers up because I think it is really important for us to understand it didn't have to be this bad. It did not have to be this bad, thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward. We know that the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States were informed about the nature of this pandemic. Back on January 28th. They were informed that it was five times as lethal as deadly as the flu. They were informed it could hurt people of every age. They were in formed that it was airborne. But what did they do with this information? They sat on it. They covered it up. They did not tell the American people. Instead, the president of the United States said it was a hoax. And then most recently, just in the last couple of days at the gall to say We're rounding the corner on it. But Phoenix, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th? How serious this was, What you as a parent, what you is a working person? What you is a small business owner or someone who works for a small business. You was a teacher what you might have done if you had known on January 28th, you know, because even before this pandemic, you know, Donald Trump was walking around talking about how the economy is great. The economy is great, right? But the fact is that in America, even before the pandemic, far too many families had to work two and three jobs to put food on the table and pay the rent. And let me just tell you something in Joe Biden and my American, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. Even before this, we were looking at the fact that the average American family had less than $1000 in savings. But how people would have prepared shoot how people would have bought a little bit more toilet paper. Have we known what this was all gonna be and Lysol. But I make light of it because the reality is they knew and they did not tell the people because they put politics in front off the priorities of the American people. And so we are now in this public health pandemic, but it is even worse than them covering it up. You do know that the president of the United States with his boy Bill bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now, suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic. The Affordable Care Act, which was brought tow us by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and brought health care to over 20 million people who did not have it protected people with preexisting conditions so that they could not be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition. Honk. If you know somebody who has diabetes, honk if you love somebody who has high blood pressure honk. If you know some body with breast cancer honk, if you know somebody with Lupus with all right and they're trying to get rid of it, you know, in part of it, I just have to say, You know, even when he was running for office, it was clear that the man just had this very weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. And this is just a extension of that. But here's the thing. Phoenix We don't really want presidents who have weird obsessions, do we? No, Joe Biden is saying. Instead of trying to get rid of the Affordable Care act, Joe and I are saying no, let's expand coverage. Let's expand coverage understanding. We need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. Let's expand coverage in terms of bringing down the cost of prescription drugs bringing down the cost of premiums. Let's expand coverage understanding. When we're talking about health care, the body just just start from the neck down. It is also the neck up , and we need to have mental health care available for everyone who needs it. There is a clear contrast, a clear choice in this election about where we go from here, a public health crisis and economic crisis. We are looking at an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Over 30 million Americans in just the last several months filed for unemployment insurance. Here in Arizona, one out of 10 families is describing their household is having been hungry. We're not talking enough about that. I've seen numbers that one in five mothers is describing her Children. Under the age of 12. We are in the midst of, ah, hunger crisis in America. Here in Arizona, one in nine families could not pay their rent. Are are worried about being able to pay their rent next month. Here in Arizona, one in four small businesses have gone out of business, and there is a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who, when asked, How do you think the economy is doing? Joe Biden will say, Well, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing Joe Biden, who says You want to talk to me about the economy? Then let's talk about what we need to do because we are not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, we are going to increase middle class tax cuts. We are going to ensure that families working families do not pay more than 7% of their income in child care. We know that the path Thio intergenerational wealth with so many families includes homeownership. So first time home buyers will get a $15,000 tax credit for a down payment and closing costs. That's how Joe thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked, How's the economy doing? You know what he says almost every time. Well, how's the stock market doing? How are rich people doing? Which is why one of his first orders of business was to pass a tax cut benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, to the point that we will be faced with a $2 trillion deficit. Well, let me tell you, if we do what we need to do in these next six days, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut on invest that money in working families. Invest that money in building up our infrastructure, building back up our roads and bridges, building back up what we need to do around renewable energies. And that's gonna be about millions of jobs because we know when you invest in the American worker in American families, we as an economy will always do well, no, there's a clear choice in this election. The crises that we are confronting include a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And you have Joe Biden, who is informed about America's history and has the courage to speak truth and say the phrase black lives matter that Joe Biden who understands it, may be difficult to hear. But we've got to confront racial disparities in America in our health care system, in our economy, in our education systems, Joe says. We need to deal with small businesses so many minority and women owned small businesses who have gone out of business. And so we will invest $150 billion in low interest loans and access to capital for those businesses. Joe knows we need to deal with the criminal justice system. It must be reformed and do that and do it in a way that is about getting rid of private prisons. Getting rid of cash bail, which is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue decriminalizing marijuana expunging expunging the records of people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Joe Biden knows we have to deal with policing, and we have to hold anybody accountable who breaks the law. And so we will put in place a ban on chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. We will say there needs to be a national registry for police officers who break the law because you can't just do it in one place and then get fired and move to another place and get hired. That's not right. Joe Biden has the courage to speak these truths in a way that is about bringing folks together and fixing the problems we know exist. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went on a debate stage debate before last, refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down, saying, Stand back and stand by and be clear. This is a pattern. This is the fellow who ran for office partly on a campaign theory to suggest that the first black president of the United States was an illegitimate president of the United States. This is the same person. There's a pattern here. Phoenix who on the on the tragedy of what happened in Charlottesville remember that people were peacefully protesting racial injustice. There was a young woman who was killed in that protest. And on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti Semitic slurs and the commander in chief. So there were fine people on both sides, a person who came into office calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. A person who came in the office in one of his first orders of business was institute a Muslim ban. We deserve so much more. Let me tell you, Joe, in his heart in his soul, is running, knowing that we must bring our country together and give dignity to all people. Joe knows it is time to End this this attempt to spew hate and division among us. It is time to end trying to get Americans to turn on each other. Joe knows the real sign of someone's strength is not based on who you beat down. It's based on who you lift up. They're really, really choices in this election. Let's deal with something that all of us on the West Coast and in this area of the world understand quite well. And it is that we are in the midst of a crisis in terms of our climate, and it poses a threat. To us as a species and we must acknowledge the science and deal with it. You've got Joe who says I see what's happening. I see that you have the West Coast, my home state of California, Oregon. Washington called all the fires, the wildfires, devastating entire communities or having to be evacuated. I have met with families that have been evacuated. I have met with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother in law is a firefighter, the devastation is profound. You go to the Gulf Coast states. In fact, right now what is it? Zeta is hitting Louisiana. It's the fifth named storm this year, I say, named be cause they don't name a small storm. It's serious what it's doing in terms of hurting the livelihood and well being of families in the Midwest floods, to the point that farmers in that area of our country have lost a whole season of crops. We have to take this seriously, Joe says. We have to deal with the science, but we have to see the opportunity, and the crisis is, well, one. The clock is ticking on this, and we need to act with a sense of urgency and put in place goals like Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to understand that we have to have ah, protection of land and open spaces. We need to understand that an investment in renewable energies is also about an investment in jobs and investment in the apprenticeship programs of our building trades and the carpenters and plumbers and the electrician's don't understands what leadership looks like on this. On the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who went approached by journalists and that the journalist said something like, You know, these wildfires that happened in California And the scientists are saying, You know, that the science tells us that these extreme weather conditions are a very big factor and what's going on? And do you know that the president of the United States of America responded? The commander in chief of the United States of America, He's supposed to be a worldwide leader, responded when asking that when being asked that question. Science doesn't know as though science is a person. Well, Mr President, science does know. it is time we take this issue seriously. So, yeah, so the stakes are high, The stakes are high. Phoenix and you in this state. The reason I'm here, the reason I was here with Joe last time I was in Tucson earlier today. The reason I'm here is to thank you, because I do believe you all are going to make a real statement about who we truly are as a country. Arizona has a well earned reputation for wanting truth talkers. Straight talkers. Arizona has a long standing reputation for no Bs just get the job done. Arizona understands that. Come to me, talk ing about issues that are the issues I deal with. They keep me up in the middle of the night that have me sitting at my kitchen table trying to figure it all out. That's what Arizona demands off its leaders. And in this election, that is what is at stake. Joe and I are very proud of the fact that in this campaign we have built one of the broadest coalitions you've ever seen. We' ve got, of course, Democrats. But we've got Republicans. Cindy McCain, Jeff Flake, Independence Peope of all back grounds coming together, understanding what is at stake. And the issues are yes, the four things we've already talked about it so much more. It's about putting. It's about putting Resources into our public education system. We will triple teachers Title one funding. It's about fighting for civil rights, including LGBTQ Rights. It is about immediately putting a pathway to citizenship and renewing protections for our dreamers under DACA. There is so much at stake. And I do believe because of who you are, you will make a difference not only in terms of who wins, but you will make a difference in terms of saying who we are. And so here's the thing you know people, then ask well, I don't know if I should vote or doesn't matter. Why should I vote? People ask these questions often, right? I'm sure all of us have been asked the question. I think there are three reasons people should vote. One is to honor the ancestors honor the ancestors. You know, this year we lost a great American hero. Congressman John Lewis. John Lewis shed his blood fighting good trouble. Shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for folks to vote right for the right for black Americans to vote. When black Americans were being denied the right to vote, John Lewis understood that was a civil rights issue. That was an issue about a statement of who we are as a country. Which is why, and John Lewis's life. He also was one of the first in line to fight for marriage equality. Why John Lewis was one of the first in line to fight for immigrant rights because he understood this is about civil rights, and he paid a price for that by shedding his blood. So let's honor the ancestors. Let's honor the ancestors. When we just this year celebrated the 1/100 anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let's honor those suffragettes who in their white marched and shouted and fought and dared any one to tell them they were less than equal. And let's also speaking truth. Remember history that black women, how ever, were not allowed to vote until 1965. But let's honor the ancestors understanding it is our responsibility. To take on what they fought for us to have as a right and to follow through with that Number two. Let' s vote. Because of everything we have discussed, that is at stake. There was so much that impacts us every day that is at stake in this election. And here's my third point about voting. You know , I'm traveling the country. I've been in Georgia, Been in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio. Um, I've been everywhere. I' m gonna be going to Texas. Um, so you know, in 2013 the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. Right? Okay. It's called Shelby V. Holder. They took out the ability of the Justice Department to enforce the need for fair voting laws, and immediately thereafter in 2013 almost two dozen states put in place laws that were designed to make it difficult for folks to vote. They purged the rolls in and and they focused on black voters, voters of color students, our indigenous brothers and sisters, right? And so much so that in North Carolina, a court of appeal reviewed the case and said that they passed a law with quote surgical precision to prevent black people from voting. That's how bad it's been. Not to mention the president, United States, that that first debate got up on a stage in front of 70 million Americans and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote and all of the states that are trying to make it confusing. I mean, states where you gotta fill out the ballot and put it in one envelope, and then you're supposed to put on another envelope. In some states where you gotta have been a third person, sign the envelope, you know, States that air picking up the drop boxes so that people can't find it easy to drop off their ballots states that air closing down polling places, the messing with the post off the post office, the post office postal workers are like the best, nicest people you could ever meet. They're messing with the post office. And so you gotta ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so confusing and difficult for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. And so let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our voice at election time through our vote because the power is with the people. And you know, when people say, Well, what do you think about what's gonna happen the day after the election? Here's what I say. America's democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. So my last point is this. This moment will pass, and years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others they're gonna look in our eyes. Each one of us and they will ask us. Where were you that moment And what we are all going to be able to tell them? It's so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did way will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized folks. We help people get to the polls. We reminded people to vote early. We texted and we called. And we emailed to the point that people got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. We did everything that was necessary to remind each other that we are not alone, that we are in this together, that we each have the power and that we love our country and are prepared to fight for its ideals. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you, Phoenix.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477474-1/senator-harris-biden-campaign-event-phoenix-arizona	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke at a Biden campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona.	477474-1	Speech

SHE MADE SEVERAL STOPS IN TEXAS ON THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTING. THE PRESIDENT WENT TEXAS BY MORE THAN NINE POINTS LAST ELECTION. HE HAS A SMALLER LEAD HEADING INTO THE FINAL WEEKEND BEFORE ELECTION DAY. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN HARRIS COUNTY. [LAUGHTER] IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN HOUSTON. THERE ARE SO MANY LONG-STANDING FRIENDS. SO MANY LONG-STANDING FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO HOLD IT DOWN, TO HOLD IT UP, AND TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO. AND I AM HERE IN TEXAS, I HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY TODAY. TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THESE MONTHS, OVER THESE WEEKS, OVER THESE DAYS. TODAY, COURSE, IS THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTING. AND NOW WE ARE FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY. [APPLAUSE] AND WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT YOU. AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE. BEFORE I CONTINUE, I WANT TO THANK TINA KNOWLES FOR THAT INCREDIBLE INTRODUCTION. TINA, YOU ARE AMAZING! YOU ARE AMAZING. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE COURAGE TO STEP UP, AND SPEAK OUT, AND LEAD. AND I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT. SO HERE WE ARE. WITHIN OUR POWER, AND IN OUR HANDS, THROUGH OUR VOICE, THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR VOTE, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. KNOWING WE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING. AND THAT WE, WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR IT. AND FIGHT FOR ITS IDEALS. THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE US. AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH A LOT. THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR CRISES IMPACTING US NOW IS A COUNTRY, ALL CONVERGING AT THE SAME TIME. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS, A PANDEMIC. BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS VIRUS, COVID-19. WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO THE POINT THAT OVER 220,000 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY, COULD NOT EVEN BE WITH RELATIVES AND FRIENDS, HOLDING THEIR HAND, SPEAKING TO THEM IN PERSON, IN THEIR LAST HOURS HOURS ON EARTH. 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THIS VIRUS, WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE BY MOST DOCTORS' ACCOUNTS, LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS, THAT INCLUDE POTENTIALLY THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING. THIS IS, HOUSTON, ONE OF THE GREATEST MASS CASUALTY EVENTS WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN OUR COUNTRY. PROBABLY ONLY AT THE SAME PROPORTION AS WORLD WAR II. AND WE HAVE WITNESSED GREATEST FAILURE OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. [APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THIS. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE NOTE THAT BACK ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT WOULD BE. HE WAS INFORMED. THAT IT IS A DEADLY VIRUS, FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS INFORMED. THAT WOULD HURT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS INFORMED THAT IT AIRBORNE. AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE SAT ON IT. HE COVERED IT UP. HE DID NOT SHARE IT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. CAN YOU IMAGINE, WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, AS A PARENT? AS A TEACHER? AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER? IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28, WHAT HE KNEW ON JANUARY 28TH? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO LIMIT THE HARM? EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, LET'S BE CLEAR, ON THIS ISSUE, WE KNOW THAT FOLKS WERE NOT DOING SO WELL BEFORE. WE KNOW THAT BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS HAD TO WORK TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN ONE JOB TO PAY THE RENT AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. [APPLAUSE] EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC, WE KNEW THAT FAR TOO MANY AMERICANS, FAMILIES HAD LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? WHAT TEACHERS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE THEIR STUDENTS? SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOW MISSING SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL PHASES OF THEIR EDUCATION. WHAT FOLKS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE TO, FRANKLY, JUST BUY A COUPLE OF EXTRA ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER. BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION. HE COVERED IT UP. HE CALLED IT A HOAX. HE SAID YOU'RE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU WHERE A MASK AND YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS LEDGER IF YOU DON'T. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH PANDEMIC, THAT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WITH HIS BOY, BILL BARR, ARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SUING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BROUGHT TO US BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT AND COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [CHEERS] RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOUR RELATIVE HAS LUPUS. RAISE HER HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS BREAST CANCER AND IS SURVEY BEING , AND IS SURVIVING. RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAUGHT COVID? THE MAN IS IN COURT TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PROTECTION OR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? HERE IN TEXAS, 10 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. [CHEERS] SO THERE IS A REAL CHOICE AND THE SELECTION ON THIS POINT. BECAUSE, EASY SEE, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO IS SAYING WE NEED TO EXPAND OBAMACARE. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PROTECTIONS FOR FOLKS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE NEED TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE WILL LOWER THE COST OF PREMIUMS. WE WILL BRING DOWN THE AGE OF MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO 60. WE UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE THE BODY DOES NOT JUST START FROM THE NECK DOWN, IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA. [CHEERS] JOE UNDERSTANDS THESE ISSUES. THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. WE ARE DEALING WITH AN ECONOMIC CRISIS. 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS ARE DESCRIBING THEIR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 12 AS BEING HUNGRY IN AMERICA. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS. PEOPLE ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ABOUT THAT. HERE IN TEXAS, ONE IN 10 HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING A MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY AS HUNGRY. 1 IN 6 HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING AN INABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. IN TEXAS, 1 IN 4 SMALL BUSINESSES IS DESCRIBING HAVING TO SHUT DOWN WITH CONCERNS THEY MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO REOPEN. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE A JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING, THEN TELL ME HOW WORKING PEOPLE ARE DOING. HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? JOE BIDEN SAYS LET'S GET $150 BILLION IN LOW-INTEREST LOANS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE WILL NOT RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE THAT MAKES LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. AND WE WILL CUT MIDDLE-CLASS TAXES. JOE BIDEN SAYS YOUR FIRST TIME HOMEOWNER WILL GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS, BECAUSE WE KNOW HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS ANY AMERICAN FAMILY ACCUMULATES WEALTH. JOE BIDEN SAYS IF YOU ARE A STUDENT THAT WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE COMING FROM A FAMILY THAT MAKES LESS THAN $125,000 A YEAR, YOU WILL GO TO A FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGE FOR FREE, INCLUDING AN HBCU AND PRIVATE HBCU. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ASKS, WELL HOW ARE RICH PEOPLE DOING? HOW IS THE STOCK MARKET DOING? TO THE POINT THAT ONE OF HIS FIRST, IN HIS MIND, SIGNATURE INITIATIVES, WAS TO CREATE A TAX CUT FOR THE TOP 1% AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA, WHICH WILL CAUSE US TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. WELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF WE WIN THIS ELECTION, JOE BIDEN AND I ARE GOING TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. WE ARE ABOUT TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN BUILD BACK OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES. WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY THAT NO WORKING FAMILY SHOULD PAY MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. WE ARE ABOUT TO PUT IN PLACE A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES, KNOWING THAT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GROWING BACK UP AMERICA'S ECONOMY, INVEST IN WORKERS, INVEST IN FAMILIES AND ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF MANY CRISES. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] AND ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO, BEING A STUDENT OF AMERICA'S HISTORY, HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK THE PHRASE BLACK LIVES MATTER. GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY IS HERE TONIGHT. GEORGE FLOYD'S LIFE MATTERED. THOSE EIGHT MINUTES AND 46 SECONDS. SO JOE HAS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING TAKING PLACE. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH RACIAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, KNOWING THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO CONTRACT COVID AND TWICE AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM IT, KNOWING THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDBIRTH THAN OTHER PEOPLE, KNOWING ARE NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE THE RECORDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS. WE NEED TO END CASH BAIL. BY THE WAY, IT IS AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE AS MUCH AS IT IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE HAVE GOT TO REFORM POLICING TO THE POINT WE ALL AGREE EVERYONE SHOULD FACE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY BREAK THE LAW. JOE SAYS WE WILL HAVE A SYSTEM THAT BANS CHOKEHOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS. BECAUSE GEORGE FLOYD MIGHT BE ALIVE TODAY IF THAT WERE THE CASE. WE WILL HAVE A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE LAW. WHY? BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT SOMEONE CAN GET FIRED ONE PLACE FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AND MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND GET HIRED. JOE HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT THIS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO STOOD ON A STAGE IN FRONT OF 70 MILLION AMERICAN PEOPLE AT A DEBATE AND REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS. AND THEN DOUBLE BACK AND STAND BY. HERE IS THE THING, HOUSTON, IT IS A PATTERN. LET'S NOT FORGET HE CAME TO FAME AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT BY QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE THERE WERE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AT A PROTEST WHERE A YOUNG WOMAN DIED, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, SPEWING RACIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC SLURS. WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ASKED ABOUT IT, HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. A PRESIDENT WHO CALLED MEXICANS RAPISTS AND CRIMINALS. A PRESIDENT WHO CAME INTO OFFICE AND ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS PUT INTO PLACE A MUSLIM BAN. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. [APPLAUSE] WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS, AND WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO REFLECTS WHO WE REALLY ARE. A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS WITHIN THE BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF WHO WE ARE, WHEREVER YOU LIVE, WHATEVER YOUR RACE, WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO SEES THAT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US AND ENDS THIS CONTINUOUS THING THAT IS ABOUT TRYING TO SOW HATE AND DIVISION. WE NEED A JOE BIDEN WHO WANTS TO UNIFY US AS A NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CRISES, THERE IS A CLIMATE CRISIS. TEXAS KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Y'ALL KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THE WEST HAS BEEN BURNING. FROM CALIFORNIA TO OREGON TO COLORADO. I'VE MET WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED BECAUSE THEIR HOMES BURNED TO THE GROUND. I MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOME IS BURNING. IN FACT, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO NEIGHBORS OF TEXAS IN THE GULF STATES. WE ARE NOW ON THE FIFTH NAMED STORM THIS YEAR HITTING THE GULF STATES. YOU KNOW WHY YOU NAME A STORM? BECAUSE IT IS REALLY BAD. THIS ONE IS ZETA. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY ZETA SISTERS. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT IS A CRISIS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. IN THE MIDWEST, THE STORMS HAVE CAUSED FLOODING TO THE POINT THAT FARMERS HAVE LOST A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. JOE UNDERSTANDS THIS. JOE SAYS WE NEED TO EMBRACE THE SCIENCE. LET'S DEAL WITH THE FACT IT LITERALLY REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO WHO WE ARE AS A SPECIES. JOE KNOWS IF YOU DEAL WITH THIS IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND IN THE TECHNOLOGIES ABOUT SOLAR AND WIND POWER, TEXAS IS ONE OF THE LEADERS, THAT YOU ALSO INVEST IN JOBS, MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS, JOBS THAT WILL BE THE FUNCTION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS FROM THE BUILDING TRADES, FROM THE CARPENTERS AND ELECTRICIANS. JOE KNOWS THAT. JOE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. JOE KNOWS THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE WHICH IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. ALL AREAS OF OUR COUNTRY WITH POOR AIR QUALITY, 70% OF THE OCCUPANTS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. JOE KNOWS, AND WE'VE MET WITH THE FOLKS IN FLINT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CRISIS. ON THE OTHER HAND , YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, WHEN INTERVIEWED BY A JOURNALIST ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA , THE JOURNALIST ASKED SOMETHING LIKE, THESE WILDFIRES ARE RAGING, THE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THIS AND THAT, THAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS CONTRIBUTING TO EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, RESPONDS TO THE QUESTION BY SAYING, SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SCIENCE DOES KNOW. MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE KNOWS SO MUCH THAT THE LEADING SCIENCE PUBLICATION HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THERE YOU GO. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING AS A NATION. THAT BRINGS ME TO THIS MOMENT, THE LAST DAY IN TEXAS FOR EARLY VOTING. GETTING PREPARED FOR THE ELECTION ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME LIKE THEY ASK ALL OF US. I AM SURE THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADERS AMONG THIS. PEOPLE SAY, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I THINK THERE ARE THREE REASONS PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE. ONE, TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. THIS YEAR WE LOST THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS, WHO IS NOW AMONG THE ANCESTORS, AND WHO, WHILE A HERO ON THIS EARTH, SHED BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. LET'S HONOR THE FACT THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. LET'S BE ACCURATE ABOUT HISTORY. BLACK WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE UNTIL 1965, AND WE CAN NOW. I HEARD THAT. LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING. YOU CAN GO DOWN THE LIST WE JUST DISCUSSED. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. JOE AND I WILL TRIPLE TITLE I FUNDING, UNDERSTANDING OUR CHILDREN ARE IN THESE SCHOOLS AND NEED RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THEIR TALENT. WE WILL PUT $70 BILLION INTO HBCU'S BECAUSE AS A PROUD GRADUATE OF AN HBCU, I KNOW WHAT THEY DO TO CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP. YOU KNOW. SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. IT IS AT STAKE THAT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 545 CHILDREN, WHO BECAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR PARENTS ARE BECAUSE OF A CHILD SEPARATION POLICY AT THE BORDER, WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHTS OFFENSE COMMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. WHAT IS AT STAKE IS CREATING A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, RENEWING A PROMISE TO OUR DREAMERS BY RENEWING DACA PROTECTIONS. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. THAT IS REASON NUMBER TWO TO VOTE. REASON NUMBER THREE. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN NORTH CAROLINA, , IN GEORGIA, IN FLORIDA, OHIO, YOU NAME IT. ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY. ESPECIALLY AFTER 2013, WHEN THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE POLICIES AND LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE. IN NORTH CAROLINA, IN FACT, THE COURT THAT REVIEWED THEIR LOSS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN WITH SURGICAL PRECISION TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE HAVE SEEN POLICIES AND LOSS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT HARD FOR FOLKS TO VOTE. YOU KNOW IN TEXAS THEY PULLED UP THE DROP BOXES. IN HARRIS COUNTY WITH 11 MILLION PEOPLE THERE IS ONE DROPBOX? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IN STATES WHERE, IF PEOPLE VOTE BY MAIL, YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BALLOT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND BE SURE TO PUT IT IN THE SECOND ENVELOPE AND SIGN THAT ENVELOPE OR GET SOMEBODY TO SIGN IT FOR YOU. THE PRESIDENT ON THE DEBATE STAGE, WHO OPENLY SOLICITED VOTER SUPPRESSION , AND NOT TO MENTION THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. I MEAN, THE POST OFFICE. RODNEY ELLIS, WHERE ARE YOU? THE POST OFFICE. LIKE THE NICEST PEOPLE WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE. THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. AND SO ALL OF THIS HAS TO LEAD US TO ASK THE QUESTION, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT AND CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? AND I THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWER. THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER TO STAND UP AND EXERCISE OUR VOICE. THEY KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW THAT WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO LET'S NOT LET ANYONE , NOT THIS ELECTION OR EVER , TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET'S NOT LET ANYONE MAKE US FEEL CONCERN OR ANXIETY ABOUT WHETHER WE MATTER. LET'S NOT GIVE ANYBODY THAT POWER OVER US TO EVER MAKE US QUESTION WHETHER WE MATTER, WHETHER WE COUNT. WE HAVE THE POWER. WE WERE BORN WITH IT. THEY DID NOT GIVE IT TO US. IT IS OURS. SO WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE TO GET EVERYBODY OUT IN FOUR DAYS ON NOVEMBER 3, THAT TUESDAY, AND MAKE SURE ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING ALONE AND PEOPLE ARE WEARING A MASK SO YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THEIR FULL FACE, YOU ARE FEELING ALONE. LET'S REMIND PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? AND WHAT I KNOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT, WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT THIS ONE FRIDAY EVENING IN HOUSTON WITH KAMALA AND ALL THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE WILL TELL THEM TINA NO GRACED US WITH HER PRESENCE. WE WERE ORGANIZING FOLKS.

CSPANKH3010202034	Kamala Harris	2020-10-30	Senator Kamala Harris Speaks at Biden Campaign Event in Fort Worth, Texas	Can we please hear for Rebecca Al Kona, she is phenomenal. You know, when I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room. Yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like that's walking in that room, having had the experiences that we've had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you. How's everybody doing? It's so good to see you. Texas Bernie's. It is so good to see you. Let me just I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Um, Bishop Spears. Where's bishops? Fears there. Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. A. Dede McGuire. I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi, DD Thank you. Thank you for your showing. Your voice. Fred Haman and Marvin Sapp. Where are they? Oh, my God. I felt like I was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both. Just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Um, Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman, and Marc Veasey. We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin, add wral red. Where is he? And Colin Allred and we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you, Texas, you are so well represented in the United States Congress with these three. And there are always in these rooms. And, you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not. And they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas, and they are national leaders, and they represent the voice of all people. So well, so thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. So, listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas, and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it? Nine million people have voted so far early voting in Texas. Nine million. Now, we know this is no time to let up on the pedal, though, right? So I know people were people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night waiting to vote, there was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. We want to make sure we see it through, and then let's make sure on election Day everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice, is represented in this election through their vote because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote, you know, just think about it right now. In our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There's the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. And the tragedy of it is so many because of the nature of this pandemic. Spent their last hours on Earth without even the benefit off, holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them. 8.5 million Almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long term consequences. You know, doctors, we're talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes were now looking at this. Let's look at the racial disparities on this virus. African Americans and Latinos there three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from the tragedy of the loss of human life. You know, I've been referring to. This is one of the greatest mass casualty events that we've experienced since World War Two. The tragedy of it. And here's why I bring it up, guys. It didn't have to be this bad. It didn't have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that the president of the United States was informed back on January 28th about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu was informed that it would hurt, people of every age was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of who people are, you're on one side of his ledger. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger. If you don't and can you imagine as parents as teachers as small business owners what you might have done if on January 28th you had known what the president of the United States said down what you might have done to prepare knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, and Joe Biden and my America, nobody should work more than one job toe, have to put food on the table and pay the rent. But what folks might have done to prepare knowing that most working families don't have even $1000 in savings what people might have done to prepare small business owners workers? Because, you see still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden Harris administration, but what people might have done to prepare teachers and students and parents around the fact that their Children are gonna miss so much of these critical days of their education what people might have done to prepare to just simply by a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. But they sat on this information and they didn't tell anybody. And now we are looking at a situation where, in the midst of a public health pandemic, you also have a situation where we have a president who, while we're seeing spikes around our country, talking about we've turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election because on the one hand you have Joe Biden, who, together with President Barack Obama, created Obama care, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act Obama care. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. We will expand health care understanding the body doesn't just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up and we need to expand mental health care. Clear choices because, you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, together with his boy Bill Bar, are in the United States Supreme Court right now trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which again brought health care to so many people here in Texas. We're looking at 10 million Texans who have pre existing conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have the over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost 89 million people who have new pre existing conditions called Cove in. There are clear choices in this election because of this pandemic. The worsening off the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her Children is being hungry here in Texas. We're looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household is having been hungry. We're in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They're not covering it enough. We're in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business. And let's be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression, and on the one hand you have Joe Biden who says, You wanna ask me about the economy and how it's doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing how our families doing in America. Which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year lowering middle cltaxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in child care. Making sure there's a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers. Understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America is to allow people toe own a home. That's how Joe Biden thinks of the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked, How's the economy doing? He will ask. Well, how's the stock market doing? He asks. How are rich people doing as one of his first orders of business? He passed a tax code benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students, coming from families that make less than $225,000 go thio Public universities tuition free, including HBC use, including private HBC use ensuring that our students, when they graduate if they take on a life of service and public service and a job that pays less than $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That's how we'll invest that money in the American people crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America, and there are clear choice. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase black lives matter. Hey, Joe Biden, who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities? We need to acknowledge them. Difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we're doing around health care. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system, Joe Biden says. Let's deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, black and brown businesses, which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community, Joe Biden says Let's deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let's get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalized marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let's shut down the private prisons. Let's get rid of cash bail. Understanding. People are sitting in jail for weeks, months and years simply because they can't afford to get out, which makes it uneconomic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who, on a debate stage two debates ago refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down and said they should stand back and stand by Donald Trump because you've got to understand this is a pattern who, when running for office and even before, had the gall thio question and challenge the legitimacy of America's first black president, the commander in chief of the United States, who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville were peaceful. Protesters were pro testing racial injustice, and ah, young woman was killed. And then on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals who, as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban America. We deserve better that does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are are strongest when we are unified knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language of grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common, and we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity clear choices in this election, not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is a climate crisis. Texas. You know that well, you look at what's going on around our country up and down the West Coast, you know, I'm from California. Up and down the West Coast, California toe upto Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I've met families that are being evacuated or been evacuated never to return to their home firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burned. And my brother in law's a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the Gulf Coast states, the neighbor, our neighbors to Texas being battered by these these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year, and you know they name a storm because it's really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent in the Midwest, you're seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose. Ah, whole season of crops, Joe Biden says. We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this, and we see that in this moment of opportunity tohave timelines, understanding. We must deal with this with a sense of urgency that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe seize the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America's auto industry and be the best in the world and production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader. And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States, who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California. So he was asked by a journalist. And the question was something like, Well, you know, Mr President, these wildfires air happening and and scientists are telling us there's a real connection between climate, with the extreme changes and and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And and what do you have to say? The president of the United States, who is also again the commander in chief, responded. Science doesn't know as those science is a person. Can you believe science doesn't know? So you know, and there's a routine through theme here, too, because right, that's how he's been treating the coronavirus right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it. Instead of trying to make everything everybody think everything's okay as as though people aren't smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play and so much more. And and that brings me to this moment where we are today. I'm here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting four days before the end of the election. And I'm here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that, um, there's a lot that we need to get done. And, um and there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And, you know, people ask me a lot, Why should I vote? Does it matter? And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote one is to honor the ancestors, honor the ancestors. I mean, you know, we Bernice Mark, we all know we lost in incredible American human. It's just a hero. Um, in Congressman John Lewis, just a hero. He is now among the ancestors John Lewis, who shed his blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, Get in good trouble. John Lewis, who lived a life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country. Knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up and speaking up. So we must vote toe honor the ancestors. This year we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes who those 100 years ago in all of their white, marching and shouting for a woman's right to vote, saying we will not be deterred. We will not be left behind. Now let us remember, because we always must speak truth about history, that black women couldn't vote until 1965. So we have to remember that. But yes, it is important toe honor Those who fought for this precious right understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us the fight for civil rights for equal rights for human rights. This fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it is precious, Thies writes. But you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we've vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake, like let's think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let's talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let's talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating Children from their parents at the border, a nation that broke its promise to the dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. And the third reason is this. So I'm traveling the country. Andi, I've been thio in the last week and a half. In fact, I'm going back to Florida tomorrow. Um, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, I Michigan. I mean, you just name it, okay. And, um, and one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013 before for sure. But since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we've been seeing, as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state Legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote have been done in such a way. You've seen that in Texas, where they're trying to remove the drop boxes where they're trying to reduce the number of polls where they're saying If you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean all kinds of things right. Leaders who have trying to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can't trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the president, United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote, not to mention what he's doing and what they're doing to mess with the post office. The post office, the best people in the world work for the post office, the post office. So we have to ask, Why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote. And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day in the spirit of John Lewis in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. Yeah, that is what is before us. And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our Children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us. They're gonna look in our eyes and they will ask us, where were you at that moment? And you see, we're going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt forward. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them. On this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in the field hanging out with Camilla. We will tell them we texted everybody called everybody emailed everybody. We knew that, Yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves. But we also knew they get over it, that we reminded people of the path that we are on. That the shoulders upon which we stand that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power. And in this moment where we are dealing with crises, we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don't let anyone make you feel small that you are big. You are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the president of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth. And God bless Texas.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477547-1/senator-kamala-harris-speaks-biden-campaign-event-fort-worth-texas	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke at a Biden campaign event in Fort Worth, Texas.	477547-1	Speech
CSPANKH3010202035	Kamala Harris	2020-10-30	Senator Kamala Harris Speaks at Biden Campaign Event in McAllen, Texas	I am so excited to be here. You are going to make the difference. This election is about you. So I am so excited to be here. I wanna thank the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley President Guy Bailey, Vice President Veronica Gonzalez, My dear friend. Secretary Julian Castro, Congressman Joaquin Castro. Beta Rourke, Henry Clay are Vicente Gonzalez and J Heger and Claressa. I'm so happy to see you. So happy to see you. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do this because we are fighting for the country. we love and we know we are better than this. So there's so much at stake in this election. And today is the last day of early voting in Texas, the last day of early voting in Texas and then the election, his four days away to elect a new president of the United States. And his name is Joe Biden. So that's what we're gonna do. And we know everything is at stake. I mean, right now in our country, we're going through four crises which have hit us all at the same time. We're looking at a public health crisis. This pandemic. Over 220,000 people in just the last several months have lost their lives. Many, many without family members nearby toe hold their hand. Because of the nature of this, over almost nine million people who have been conflict afflicted with this virus, who are gonna have unknown long term health consequences, doctors air talking about lung scarring and things of that nature. People are suffering. Meanwhile, you have the commander in treat, the president, United States, who took to a stage and said, We're rounding the corner. Are you kidding me? Meanwhile, We have a president of the United States who, thanks to Bob Woodward, we know knew in January about how serious this is. He knew in January, January 28th that it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew on January 28th that it could hurt people of every age. He knew then that it was airborne, and he covered up that information and he did not tell the American people. Moreover, he had the gall to call it a hoax to suggest that there are two kinds of people on his ledger, the kind that wear masks and the kind that don't in a public health crisis with one of the most highly contagious airborne viruses we've ever seen. And can you imagine Rio Grande what you would have done on January 28th if you had known what the president had known? What you as a front line worker, what you as a parent, what you as a teacher, what you, as a small business owner, would have done if you had known on January 28th? Because here's the deal. Even before the pandemic, the situation in our country was such that people had to work two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. And, by the way, in Joe Biden's America, nobody should have to pay, have more than one job to put food on the table and pay the rent. But imagine what you would have done when we know most American families don't even have $1000 in life savings and what people might have done to save up a little bit, knowing that they may not be able goto work because still, in our country, people goto work without paid sick leave and paid family. Leave something Joe Biden and I are gonna end, making sure all workers are respected for the dignity of their work, including paid sick leave and paid family leave. Imagine what people would have done knowing our Children might miss critical stages, critical amounts of education time and what people might have done to prepare for that, not to mention what people might have done to prepare to buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper if we had known what he knew on January 28th and in the midst of this public health pandemic, where hundreds of thousands of people have died where nine million people have contracted the virus. Donald Tand his boy Bill Bar are in the United States Supreme Court, suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people, including protecting people with pre existing conditions. Hunk If you know anybody who has diabetes, hunk, If you know anybody who has high blood pressure, Lupus, breast cancer and you see Barack Obama together with Vice President, Biden created the Affordable Care Act, knowing people with preexisting conditions, including the 10 million Texans who have pre existing conditions should be protected. But Donald Trump's in court right now trying to get rid of that and, you know, part of the issue that I see. Let's remember this from the time the guy was running for office. Until now, Donald Trump has had this weird obsession. We're trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Do we need presidents with weird obsessions? No, we're done with that, aren't we? There are clear contrast in this election. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who helped push through the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden, who was saying, We will expand health coverage. We will bring down the cost of premiums. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will lower Medicare eligibility Thio age 60 We know that health care means understanding. The body doesn't just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and that's called mental health care. They're clear choices in this election, and on the other hand, you have the current president who's trying to get rid of coverage for over 20 million people. The crises we are dealing with the crisis from this pandemic, that is this economic crisis were over 30 million Americans in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We're here in Texas. We're looking at one in 10 families that has described their household is being hungry. We're here in Texas. One in six households is finding it difficult, if not impossible, to pay rent. We're here in Texas. One in four small businesses is out of business and fear they will never be able to reopen. There's a clear choice in this election because you see, on the one hand you have Joe Biden. Yeah, and when you asked Joe Biden How's the economy doing? Joe Biden says, Well, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing. Joe Biden says. You want to measure the economy, Then let's measure the greatness of the economy based on getting folks paid sick, leave paid family leave. Let's deal with the economy by making sure no working family pays more than 7% of their income in child care. Let's deal with the economy and not raise taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 and bring down taxes for middle class families, he says. You want to talk about the economy well. One of the best ways to grow the economy and any families economic well being is homeownership. So we'll have a tax credit of $15 for every new home buyer for down payments and closing costs. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, when asked about the economy, asks about the stock market, asks about how rich people are doing. As one of his first orders of business passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. Well, Rio Grande. I promise you this as a first order of business. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut and invest that money in working families. Invest that money on building back up our infrastructure, which means the creation of millions of jobs building back up our infrastructure around roads and bridges and renewable energy investing in working people and small businesses with a focus on $150 billion in low interest loans and access to capital for minority owned businesses. That's how we will deal with this. That's how we will invest. Our resource is there are clear contrast and clear choice in this race. Let's deal with the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. Yeah, so on the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was a student of American history and has the courage to say black lives matter. Oh, Joe Biden, who says any riel leader must speak truth, no matter how difficult it may be. To hear, any riel leader must acknowledge the racial disparities that exist in America and deal with them. Deal with what we need to handle in our public health care system when African Americans and Latinos air three times likely to contract covert and twice as likely to die from it. Deal with it when we know Latinos have the some of the highest rates of diabetes of any population, highest rates of high blood pressure of any population. And we need to deal with that. Let's deal with the disparities in terms of our public public education system and put resource is into Title one schools, knowing that is where our Children, who have such God given capacity, deserve to have. The resource is toe, allow them to grow and develop. And that is why we will triple title one funding. Joe Biden has the courage and the ability to see what's going on to say disproportionately black and Latino young people are being arrested, and we need to address the disparities in our criminal justice system and reform the system by doing a number of things. Getting rid of mandatory minimums, decriminalizing marijuana, expunging the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana, shutting down private prisons, eliminating cash bail because that is an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who at the first debate you guys remember this at the first debate, refused to condemn white supremacists and then double down by saying, Stand back and stand by and remember, this wasn't a one off. We've seen a pattern. Let's go back to the fact that he ran trying to suggest that the first black president of the United States was not a legitimate president of the United States. Let's remember, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were priests peacefully protesting racial injustice, a young woman was killed. And on the other side there were neo Nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, hurling racial epithets, anti Semitic epithets. And the president of the United States said, there are fine people on each side. The president of the United States, who called Mexicans, rapists and criminals, the president of the United States who has his first order of business, put in place a Muslim ban. We deserve better than this, and Joe Biden, in his heart, knows who we really are as America Joe Biden in his heart. Nos that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, the language your grandmother speaks Joe Biden knows that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And it is time that we reject hate and division and unify as a country. There are clear choices. Let's deal with an issue Texas knows well, the issue of the climate crisis. It okay, you said it correctly. So Texas knows we're dealing with a climate crisis as a world we're looking at on the West Coast, you know where I'm from. We're looking at wildfires from California to Washington over to Colorado, whole communities of people being burned out of their homes. I've met people who have been evacuated from their homes, never to be able to return. I've met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother. In laws of firefighter, we look at the Gulf States neighbors to Texas. There have been five named storms this year alone. They name a storm because it's that bad. Five, the most recent one beings Ada. We're looking at what's been happening in the Midwest farmers losing a whole season of crops because of the floods, Jill Biden says. We need to embrace science. We need to speak truth. We need to deal with this with timelines and a sense of urgency because we need to be able to breathe clean air and drink clean water and see the connection between human behaviors and the crisis we are facing. Joe knows this is not only about what we need to do for our environment. The opportunity in the moment is we can also create jobs. We can invest in infrastructure in renewable energies in solar and wind, and that will be million's of jobs. Joe also knows this is an environmental justice issue. When you're looking at the fact that in all of the areas in the country that have poor air quality, 70% of the people who live in those places are people of color. Joe knows that and he understands how we can build back better in a way that we deal with the science. We build up an infrastructural, create millions of jobs, and we do it in a way that is about equitable outcomes, and we build back better. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Okay, so here's the thing On the issue of the wildfires he was interviewed and the journalists at something like, You know, these wildfires air happening in California and the science sister saying that there's a connection between the extreme weather and the fires and the president of the United States, the commander in chief responded. Science doesn't know. Can you imagine as those science is a person literally rejecting the notion that we have so much evidence that is undisputed about what is upon us and the opportunity we have in the moment. So Rio Grande I say all this to say there's a lot that we need to deal with, and these are many of the issues that are at play in this election, and Texas has been turning it out. You guys have been turning it out and you have been turning it out. You have been standing in line, you've been organizing. You are making a huge difference. And so here's the thing on voting. You know, I think there are three reasons that people need to vote. You know, people ask, Why should I vote? Why is an important. There's three reasons I think one. It's important to vote toe an ER on ER. The ancestors honor the ancestors. All those people who came before us, who fought for our right to vote. People like John Lewis, the congressman who passed away this year, who said, Let's get in good trouble. John Lewis, who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for our right to vote. John Lewis, who knew this was a matter of civil rights and dignity. John Lewis, who understood that it was also a matter of civil rights and dignity, to fight for for same marriage. John Lewis, who also knew it was a matter of civil rights and dignity, to fight for protections for dreamers and for a pathway for citizenship. So it's important to vote toe honor the ancestors, you know. This year we celebrated the 19th Amendment, which allowed women to vote. We celebrated the 1/100 anniversary of the 19th Amendment, all those suffragettes who 100 years ago marched and fought for our right to vote. Now it's important to remember history because it wasn't until 1965 that black women could vote so we still have work to do, but it is time to vote to honor the ancestors. That's reason number one. Reason Number two. Everything is at stake, right? Everything is at stake when this administration has orphaned 545 Children because of a policy that has it been about separating Children from their parents at the border. Everything is at stake when we are looking at the fact that 200,000 of our frontline workers have been dreamers who were promised DACA protection. Everything is at stake. Everything is at stake when we need to create a pathway towards citizenship. Everything is at stake when we talk about equal pay for equal work for women. Yeah, everything is at stake. So that's reason number two. And then here's reason number three. So I've been traveling the country and I'll tell you, just like here in Texas, there are powerful people around our country that have been making it really difficult for people to vote. They've been passing laws, you know. In North Carolina, they passed a law that the court that reviewed the law said it was written with surgical precision to prevent black people in North Carolina for voting. We have seen this around the country where laws have been put in place to make it difficult for people of color, for students, for our Native American brothers and sisters to vote laws like here in Texas, where they're taking the drop boxes where they're in other places where they're shutting down polling sites where they're requiring people toe fill out to different envelopes if their mail in ballot is gonna account. The president who took the debate stage and in front of 70 million Americans openly solicited a suppression of the vote. So we have to ask, Why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? Why are they, for example, messing with the post office? I mean, the post office, like the nicest people, work for the post office. Why are they doing this? And I believe it is because they know our power. Yeah, they know our power and we know our power, and we will not let anyone take our power from us. And that is the reason that is the reason that we are all here today to celebrate each other and to fight for this country we love. And so my last point is this This moment this moment will pass. It will pass. And one day in the future our Children, our grandchildren, others They will look in our eyes. Each one of us. They're gonna look in our eyes and they will ask us. Where were you at that moment and what we are gonna tell them? As we were hanging out at UT Rio Grande Valley this Friday afternoon on the last day of early voting, we will tell them we organized. We will tell them we brought people to vote. We will tell them. We told them about what is at stake. We will tell them We reminded people of the ancestors and our responsibility and commitment to them. We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden, president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Rio Grande.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477546-1/senator-kamala-harris-speaks-biden-campaign-event-mcallen-texas	2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) made remarks in McAllen, Texas, on the last day of early voting in the Lone Star State.	477546-1	Speech
CSPANKH3110202036	Kamala Harris	2020-10-31	Senator Kamala Harris Campaigns in Miami	Can we hear for Sergeant paul Cruz man? He's so good. Where is? Where are you? I want to know what you're going to run for. Where is he? What an incredible, incredible leader. American leader. I want to congratulate and thank all the leaders who have been a part of today. Um, Congresswoman Debbie Marcus L. Powell, Thank you for welcoming us to your district. Magdala Orioles that joe Jose Andres and of course senator or sergeant paul Kruse, thank you all. There's the congresswoman. Thank you all. Okay, you guys ready to do this, We're gonna do this, we're gonna do this. And let me just start by saying, you know, I know there's been, you know, folks on the other side trying to, trying to question the values that joe biden and I have. So let me just be really clear florida, joe biden and I are proud patriotic americans who share the values with the vast majority of the american people who want a president of the United States, who speaks truth, who uses that platform, not to beat people down, but to lift people up the vast majority of the american people who want a president who understands that regardless of where we live, our race, our gender, the language our grandmother speaks, that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. That's what the american people want. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we want. So there's so much at stake, guys, so much at stake in florida has been so hard hit. Um, you know, I think that we're dealing right now with four crises that have all happened at the same time, We're dealing with this coronavirus, this pandemic, right? Which at this point has killed over 225,000 people in just the last several months. People who, tragically in many cases were alone because of the nature of the virus couldn't have family with them to hold their hands in their last hours and minutes on earth. This pandemic that has Afflicted nine million people in our country who by the way, will likely experience long term health impacts. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. We are looking at a moment where there has been such tragedy in terms of loss of life, a mass casualty event that can only be compared to World War Two. And here's the thing, the president of the United States, who is also the Commander in chief and it's important to point out everything Sergeant Cruz said about the responsibility that comes with what we give that person to become that including that their first priority should be the health and safety of the american people. But what do we have in the guy who is currently in the White House on the issue of this pandemic? Thanks to a guy by the name of bob Woodward. We know he knew back on January 28 that this virus could kill people at five times the rate of the flu. We know he knew that it would impact people of every age. He knew it was airborne. And what did he do with that information right system? He covered it up. He didn't tell the american people. Can you imagine as a parent, as a teacher, as a small business owner, What you might have done? Had you known on January 28 what the president knew what you might have done? Because here's the thing. Even before the pandemic, far too many americans were working two and three jobs to put food on the table and pay the rent. And by the way in joe biden and my America, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on the table how people might have prepared, how people might have prepared knowing that even before the pandemic. Most families don't have Even $1,000 in savings. And if folks had known the predictable, which is that we might have to isolate, we may have to shut things down for a little bit. People could have saved up how people could have prepared buying an extra couple rolls of toilet paper. But they sat on that information. And now in the midst of this public health crisis, Donald Trump with his boy bill barr are in the United States Supreme Court suing to get rid of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act that President Obama together with Joe Biden brought to America and covered over 20 million people, including people with preexisting conditions hunk. If you know somebody with diabetes hunk, if you know somebody with high blood pressure hunk, if you know somebody with breast cancer or lupus, Yeah. And they're trying to take it away. So there's a clear choice in this election because you see on the one hand, there's joe biden who says we're going to expand what we did in creating Obamacare. We're going to make sure we bring down the cost of premiums and prescription medication. We're gonna bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. We're gonna deal with the fact that when we're talking about health care, the body doesn't just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up and that's called mental health care. Yeah, yeah. A clear choice in this election. A clear choice this pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in an economic disaster that is being compared to the Great Depression. Over 30 million people in just the last several months have filed for unemployment here in florida. One in nine households is describing their household as having been hungry Here in Florida, one in 7 households is describing having a difficult time or finding it impossible to pay rent here in florida, one in four small businesses is out of business, likely never to be able to reopen. And what does Donald trump say we're rounding the corner. But here's the thing on the economy. So on the one hand, you have joe biden, who when asked how's the economy doing? Always ask the question. Well, tell me how working people are doing, Tell me how working families are doing. Mhm. Which is why joe biden will not increase taxes on anyone. Making under $400,000 a year will bring down middle class taxes. Will put in place A policy where if you have Children, you will pay no more than 7% of your income in childcare. We will have a tax credit for first time home buyers of $15,000 knowing that will help with down payment and closing costs. And on the other hand, you have donald trump who? When asked yes baby Who when asked about the economy as well. How's the stock market doing? Asks how are rich people doing? Which is why as one of his first orders of business, he passed a tax cut For the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, which will cause us to have to deal with a $2 trillion dollar deficit. Well with your help florida Over these next three days. When and God willing if we win joe biden and are about to get rid of that tax cut and invest that money in working people Invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, repairing our roads and bridges, investing in renewable energy and the creation of millions of jobs investing in our students who come from families that have less than $125,000. So you can go to the four year state college free or an hbcu free. The crises we are dealing with includes a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. And on the one hand, you have joe biden who being a student of american history and having the courage to speak truth can say and speak the phrase black lives matter. Joe biden who says we need to deal with racial disparities in America. We need to speak truth about systemic racism. We need to acknowledge that on this virus blacks and Latinos are three times as likely to contract it and twice as likely to die from it. We need to speak truth about disparities in our health care system. When black women are 3-4 times more likely to die in connection with childbirth and other women. We need to speak truth about a criminal justice system and reform that system and decriminalized marijuana and expunge the records of people who have been convicted of marijuana offenses and shut down private prisons and end cash bail because it is not only a criminal justice issue, it is an economic justice issue. On the other hand, you have donald trump Who took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists who then doubled down and said they should stand back and stand by. And let's be clear, this is part of a pattern because remember he came in office questioning the legitimacy of the first black President of the United States. Yeah. Mhm. Remember on the issue of Charlottesville, where folks were peacefully protesting racial injustice, one young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were a bunch of neo nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, spewing racial and anti Semitic epithets. And the President of the United States said there are fine people on both sides, A President of the United States who came into office calling mexicans rapists and criminals put in his first sort of business, a muslim ban in effect, we don't want that in the President of our United States, we deserve better. Mhm. Yeah. We want a President of the United States who understands you want to measure the strength of anyone. You want to measure their strength. You measure a person's strength, not by who they beat down, but who they lift up. And we are in the midst also of a climate crisis. It's hot and it's getting hotter. A climate crisis. You know, I come from California, the wildfires have been just burning up the west coast, from California Oregon and Washington to Colorado. You know, I've I've met families and met with families who had to evacuate. They lost their home permanently lost their home. I've met with firefighters who were fighting the wildfires while their own homes were burning. In fact, my brother in law's a firefighter, um, you know, in the gulf coast states, you all know that the storms that have been hitting, do you know, we've had five named storms just this year and we name a storm because it's that bad that it should actually be acknowledged with a name. That's how bad things are. And so joe biden says, hey, we need to deal with the science. We need to embrace the reality and the urgency and the immediacy of this issue. We need to understand it is not only an existential threat to us as a species, it is something that transcends into civil rights and human rights issues. When you know that of all the people in our country who live in poor air quality zones, 70% of people of color, He knows that when we're talking about water as an issue, we think of places like flint and joe says, let's deal with the science but do it in a way that we also see an economic opportunity for the creation of jobs, investment in renewable energy, investment in solar and wind. On the other hand, you have donald trump who I kid you not. When asked about the wildfires in California, and the question went, something like Mr President, You know, these wildfires are happening, the scientists are telling us that their extreme changes in the climate, that that there's a connection also with human behaviors. Do you know that the President of the United States responded by saying Science doesn't know the President of the United States? Well, here's the thing. Mr. President Science does. No. And so does the leading Science magazine that endorsed joe biden for President of the United States. So there's a lot going on and we got three days to get this done. And so let's talk for a minute about voting. You know, people have been asking me and I'm sure you because this is a whole beautiful group of leaders. People have been asking why should I vote? And I think there are three reasons that everyone should vote. One. Honor the ancestors honor the ancestors. Honor people like the late great john Lewis who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus bridge so we could vote. I know he hears you. I know he hears you Honor the ancestors, those suffragettes who 100 years ago got us the passage of the 19th Amendment. But let's always speak truth. Black Women couldn't vote until 1965. So there is that so reason, Number one, let's honor the ancestors who sacrificed so much for our right to vote. Reason Number two, everything is at stake. Everything everything we just discussed, including creating a pathway for citizenship, For undocumented immigrants, renewing our promise to our dreamers with DACA shutting down private detention centers, reuniting 545 Children with their parents who the United States government orphaned. There's every reason to vote in terms of what's at stake. And then here's the last point that I'd make is reason Number three, including that America's future is at stake. We are, I'm traveling all over the country. This is my, I don't know how many times I've been to florida since I've been on the ticket and many times before that. Thank you Debbie, um, all over our country, people are putting in place laws and procedures to make it difficult for us to vote, making it confusing to vote. You know, purging voter rolls passing laws to suppress the vote, picking up drop boxes. That was in Houston yesterday, a county of 11 million people with one drop box, trying to make it confusing in different places in florida, different days, right. Different envelopes you gotta fill out and who's gonna sign them? The President of United States, who took the stage at the debate and openly attempted to suppress the vote. So here's the thing when we look at where we are in terms of these powerful people who are trying to and we're not gonna be distracted by what's at hand, we're not gonna be distracted by the stakes. We're not gonna be distracted, we know what we have to do. And so here's my point. Here is my point. You got to ask why are these powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? And I will tell you, I believe the reason they're trying to make it difficult and confusing for us to vote. It's because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. They know our power and let us not ever let anyone take our power from us. And so my last point, Miami is this, this moment will pass and years from now. Our Children, our grandchildren will ask us, where were you at that moment? And what we will tell them. It's so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them. We organized, we mobilized. We stood in line, we emailed and texted and called everybody we knew multiple times until they got sick of us. But we knew they get over it. And we will tell them we elected joe biden the next president of the United States. Thank you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477610-1/senator-kamala-harris-campaigns-miami	Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 2020 Democratic vice presidential nominee, addressed supporters at a campaign rally in Miami-Dade County, Florida.	477610-1	Speech
CSPANKH3110202037	Kamala Harris	2020-10-31	Senator Kamala Harris Campaigns in Broward County, Florida	Hi everybody. Hi Broward County and all our young leaders. Hi. Hi everyone. Oh it's good to be back. first of all. Let me thank Pastor Fernandez where are you? There you are. Thank you so very much for just you know, listen, I I say these days we must walk by faith, not by sight. Um but thank you for the introduction. Thank you to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Where are you? It's so good to see all the friends. Where's Jill? There you are. Hi, good. Hello everyone. Yeah. So Early voting ends tomorrow at seven and the election that will determine the course of our future as a nation. And dare I say, as a world Will be decided on November three, just three days from today. And I'm really feeling very optimistic about the possibilities and in large part because of what you all have been doing and continue to do. You know, the world knows the nation knows and joe and I know the path to the White House leads through florida. Oh and you all have been laying the groundwork for years, for months, for weeks, for days and reminding people that we are all in this together and reminding folks of what is at stake. And of course there was so much and we've been through so much, you know, we are in the midst of of course, four crises that have converged at one time, a public health crisis of course, because of this pandemic Where we have seen over 225,000 people in our country who have died in just the last several months. You know, I've been talking about this as a mass casualty event of a of a proportion that we've really not seen since World War Two. And the tragedy of it includes the fact that because of the nature of this virus, so many people passed without the ability to have family members with them holding their hands in those last days on earth. We're looking at over nine million people now who have contracted the virus with untold long term health consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring, but there's no question. We now have nine million people who now in addition to those who had it before have a pre existing condition called Covid. Um and and the tragedy of this is it didn't have to be this bad Broward County. It did not have to be this bad, but we have a president of the United States who when thanks to a fellow by the name of bob Woodward When he was informed back on January 28, informed that this is a pandemic. That we're talking about. A virus that is highly contagious and deadly, more deadly. Five times more deadly than the flu is airborne will affect people of every age. He covered that information up. He did not share it with the american people. Can you imagine as a parent, as a small business owner, as a teacher, What you might have done if you had known what the president knew on January 28, how you might have prepared how you might have planned? Because remember even before this pandemic, So many families in our country, working people had to work two and 3 jobs to put food on the table and pay the rent. And by the way, in a biden administration, our belief is nobody should have to work more than one job to put food on the table and pay the rent. But how people might have prepared knowing that most american families don't have More than $1,000 in savings. How they might have prepared how small businesses might have prepared when we're looking at the impact here in florida and around the country. Um, you know, I joke, but seriously how we might have prepared just to buy an extra couple of rolls of toilet paper those days, right? But they sat on this information and now we are looking at the pain and the loss that so many people have suffered and on top of all of this, in the midst of a public health crisis donald trump together with his boy, Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama and Vice President biden brought to the american people and allowed for over 20 million people to have coverage including protecting people with pre existing conditions. And now they're trying to get rid of it. And let's put this in context, raise your hand. If you know somebody who has diabetes, raise your hand, if you love somebody who has high blood pressure or surviving breast cancer or lupus, and they're trying to get rid of these protections. And this brings up the one of many ways that the american people that Floridians have a real choice in front of them because on the one hand you have joe biden Who, together with President Obama created the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden, who says we come into office and we're going to expand on what it did. We're gonna bring down prescription drug prices, were going to bring down the cost of premiums, we're gonna lower Medicare eligibility to age 60. We're gonna deal with health care in a way that we expand coverage. Understanding that health care doesn't mean the body starts from the neck down. It also includes health care from the neck up that's called mental health care, which we sorely need to expand. There's a real clear choice here. Two very different choices. So that's joe. And on the other hand, you have someone who has lied. Yes. I said that, lied to the american people has not followed the science who has suggested this as a hoax, who has suggested that on the ledger, he keeps you on one side of his ledger. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger. If you don't, there's a real clear choice these crises, the economic crisis that has resulted from this pandemic Being compared to the Great Depression in terms of its impact. Over 30 million people in just the last several months filed for unemployment here. In florida, One in nine families is describing their household as having been hungry. We're in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. One in five mothers. I've seen the numbers, describes your Children under the age of 12 as being hungry in America. Today, we're looking in florida at one in seven households who is describing a difficulty paying their rent or inability to pay their rent here. In florida, one in four small businesses have gone out of business with very small likelihood of being able to reopen economic devastation. And again, you have a joe biden who when asked, how do you think the economy is doing? How are you measuring the economy? Joe biden responds with, Well, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing, Joe biden says We need to move forward, not increasing taxes for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We will increase Tax cuts for middle class families. We will ensure that working families pay no more than 7% of their income in childcare. We will ensure that first time home buyers get a $15,000 tax credit to help with down payment or closing costs. Understanding that homeownership is one of the greatest paths toward economic health and wellbeing, intergenerational health and well being. That's how joe thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have donald trump who? When asked, How is the economy doing? Asks the question. How's the stock market doing? Asks how are rich people doing? Which clearly is what motivated what he considers to be one of his greatest achievements was a tax bill that they passed benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America, leading to a $2 trillion dollar deficit that everyone else will have to deal with. Well, I'm going to tell you something Broward County, we're gonna do everything we can over these next three days and God willing, we are gonna win this election and joe and I are about to get rid of that tax cut and invest that money in working people and in our families invest that money in an infrastructure plan. That is gonna be about, yes, building back up our roads and our bridges, but also investing in renewable energies. It is going to create millions of jobs. We are going to invest that money, understanding that any young person coming from a family that makes less than 100 and $25,000 will go to a four year public college for free, including an HBCU because that that's how we build up. And as joe likes to say, build back better invest in the american, people invest in our young people, invest in our families and boy, the return on that investment is profound. We are dealing with crises a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And you have joe being a student of american history and having the courage to speak truth. Who has the ability, ability and willingness to speak the phrase black lives matter, joe who says we must speak truth no matter how difficult it may be. For some to hear, we must acknowledge racial disparities. We must acknowledge What the virus has highlighted. For example, in our health care system. When African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract the virus and twice as likely to die from it. When black women are 3-4 times likely to die in childbirth as compared to other women. When our native american brothers and sisters have the highest rates of diabetes of any population in our country, we must speak truth about these things and address them with the motivation being that we have to have a society that is built on a respect for the concept of equality and reaching equality through initiatives that are about achieving equity. On the other hand, you have donald trump who on the debate stage in the first debate, we all remember refused to condemn white supremacists and then went on to double down and talk about, stand back and stand by. And I think it's really important to put this in context and to understand a pattern. We have witnessed a pattern that started before he was running for president, where he questioned the legitimacy of the first black president of the United States. We're on the issue of Charlottesville, where there were peaceful protesters protesting racial injustice in America. A young woman died in that protest. And on the other side, there were neo nazis wearing swastikas carrying tiki torches, spewing racial anti Semitic slurs. And the President of the United States says there were fine people on both sides. The President of the United States was called Mexicans, rapists and criminals who as one of his first orders of business put in place a muslim ban. And here's the thing, we are better than this. We are so much better than this thing about who we are as americans and as a people is we know that the real measure of strength is not measured based on who you beat down. It is measured based on who you lift up. And many of us know joe and let me tell you something joe in his heart and his soul is someone who is deeply committed to unifying our country. He and I know and we all know regardless of where you live. Your race, your ethnicity, you your gender or the language your grandmother speaks. We all know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and we want and need a president who leads with that spirit. Yeah. And on the list of crises, florida knows this well. We are dealing with a climate crisis. It is undeniable. You know, I come from California. The wildfires are burning up the west coast of our country from California Oregon Washington colorado. I've met with and visited with families that have been evacuated from their home never to be able to return. I have visited with firefighters that are putting out fires while their own homes are burning. My brother in law's a firefighter. When you look at the gulf coast states neighbors to hear, including the state the storms, do you know, we've had five named storms in our country this year and we named the storm because it's really bad what we've seen in terms of the midwest and the floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. And so joe says, hey, this is undeniable. Let us embrace the science on this. Let us treat this with a sense of urgency and put in place timelines like the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Let us understand that all of us need to breathe clean air and drink clean water, joe understands this is also a civil rights and human rights issue. When you look at the fact that in all of the jurisdictions of poor air quality in our country, In 70% of them, it's people of color who lived there, joe understands that when we talk about this crisis, there is a moment of opportunity in this crisis which is to invest in renewable energies or invest in wind turbines and solar paneling, invest in building up the skills of America's workforce to take on the jobs that are necessary to confront this crisis and investment in our infrastructure, which which will create millions of jobs. Joe understands that on the other hand, you have donald trump who when he was asked about the wildfires in California. So the journalist asked something along the lines of so Mr President, these wildfires are happening, people are suffering. Um and the scientists are telling us there's a connection between this and the extreme weather conditions and and human behaviors that have contributed. The President of the United States of America, who is also the Commander in chief of the United States of America, responded by saying Science doesn't know. Science doesn't know this is what the president of our country said. And so here's the thing Mr. President Science does. No. And so does the major scientific magazine which has endorsed joe biden for President of the United States. So we're dealing with a lot. It's a lot. It's a lot. It is. But we're all here together. We're all here together. And yes, these moments, you know, and in particular when you compound it with what we have had to do to deal with this virus and social isolation and the distancing, look at all of us, you know, we can't even shake hands and hug were wearing masks. It has a tendency to really make people feel alone. And I think that what's important about this afternoon and what you all have been doing throughout really makes a statement that we are not alone. And that then brings up one of the reasons for my visit today, which is the importance of voting, voting today and tomorrow. In terms of early voting, early voting is critically important. And then of course voting on Tuesday and you know, many people come up to me and probably to you and they say why should I vote? And I think there are three reasons people should vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Yeah, honor the ancestors. People like a friend of Ted and Debbie and mine, our colleague, the great, great, great american hero, john Lewis, john Lewis who told us you love your country, getting good trouble, john Lewis who shed his blood on that Edmund Pettus bridge so that in particular black people could vote, but that all people could vote, john Lewis who by the way also understood it was a civil rights issue. And there is a continuum of the fights that we have had and continue to have for civil rights, john Lewis who by the way, was front and center, fighting for marriage equality, john Lewis, by the way, who was front and center saying we should fight for the dreamers. Let's honor the ancestors. That's a reason to vote. It's a reason to vote. Is we just celebrated this year, the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment, right among the ancestors, those suffragettes who wearing their white marched and shouted and fought for a woman's right to vote. It's important also because we also have to speak truth, um, black women can vote until 1965, so we've got to deal with that too. But yes, let's honor the ancestors. That's a reasonable reason. Number two, everything is at stake, Everything is at stake. Everything we have already discussed, including our standing in a global world, the integrity of our nation. You know, one of the things about where we have been in America's strength around the world. Yes, we have one of the finest militaries, but our strength also comes from the fact that we were known for the most part of being a nation that kept its word. That we knew the difference between our allies and our adversaries that we honored our commitments, including our traditions that include a respect and reverence for the rule of law, for the sanctity of one's election system and the need to protect it from foreign interference, things like that. Yeah, so there's everything at stake. Everyth ng is at stake. Reason. Number three, I've been traveling around the country this I just actually was just in florida I think a week, week and a half ago. Um been to Georgia, north Carolina. Um yesterday I was in texas. I've been to, yeah, that they're doing a great job in texas. Um I was in Nevada Arizona, you get the plane michigan All over our country. You know, starting in terms of recent history, starting with 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act Where it basically took the teeth out of our ability to protect against states that have a history of discriminating against voters. So back since 2013, probably almost two dozen states enacted laws that have been designed to suppress the vote targeting african american voters, voters of color students, um native americans, you name it. And so much so that in north Carolina, a court that reviewed the law that they passed said it was designed with quote surgical precision to prevent in that case black people from voting. So we've been seeing this happen. We know all of these what we've seen here in florida. I mean, you know, the attempt to make voters confused the attempt to make it difficult. Um, we've seen around the country, you know, so I was in texas yesterday in Houston Harris County, you know, like that. Um, and they in texas One, they're allowing one dropbox per county. And in Harris County, there are 11 million people guys, one drop box in other states. We're seeing, you know, this thing about you gotta, if you're gonna vote by mail, you fill out your ballot and then you can put it in one envelope, but don't forget to put it into that second envelope and then you gotta sign that. And then in some states, you know, somebody else has to sign it, all kinds of stuff. We're seeing, you know, the President of the United States essentially took that debate stage and openly encouraged the suppression of the vote. So I bring all this up to say, one has to ask why are so many important people going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I do believe the answer is because they know our power, they know our power, they know when we vote, things change, they know when we vote, we win. So let's not ever let anyone take our power from us. We know we have the power that in our democracy, the power is with the people. You know, people ask me all the time, well, what do you think is gonna happen the day after the election? I said, look, there is no question that over these last almost four years our democracy has taken a beating. The rule of law, respect for the rule of law, the respect for the independence of the Department of Justice. I mean, I could go down the list, Right. No question. It has taken a beating. You know, you almost want to think about like a hurricane hit a house. Yes. Some of the shingles have fallen off, but the house is still standing. I do believe that America's democracy will always be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that's why we're all hanging out together this afternoon because we are prepared to do just that. We are prepared to do what is necessary to stand up for this country we love. And so my last point then is this, this moment will pass. It will pass and years from now. Our Children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes, each one of us and they will ask us where were you at that moment in time and what we will be able to tell them Broward County is so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized, we mobilized. We will tell them we emailed and we text and we called everyone we knew repeatedly until they got sick of us but we knew they'd get over it. We will tell them that we reminded people that we are all in this together. We will tell them that we reminded everyone we know of their individual power. We reminded them that the power in our country comes from the people and we will tell them we elected joe biden the next president of the United States.

PRESIDENT TRUMP WON FLORIDA FOUR YEARS AGO. IT IS CURRENTLY RATED AS A TOSSUP. EARLY VOTING ENDS THIS WEEKEND. (music) (music) WHAT'S UP, PALM BEACH? [APPLAUSE] CAN WE HEAR IT FOR RAFAEL GUTIERREZ? SO GOOD. SO GOOD. THAT IS WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE. WHAT RAFAEL KNOWS IS REAL LEADERSHIP COMES FROM THE PEOPLE. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE IN PALM BEACH. LOIS FRANKEL, WHERE ARE YOU? CONGRESSWOMAN LOIS FRANKEL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, IT IS GOOD TO BE IN YOUR HOME DISTRICTS. THANK YOU, SISTER. TERRY RIZZO, THE CHAIR OF THE FLORIDA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. TED DEUTCH. WE WERE JUST TOGETHER. THANK YOU, CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTCH. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE LEADERS, ALL OF THE LEADERS, ELECTED AND NOT ELECTED, FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BEEN DOING HERE IN FLORIDA, BECAUSE FLORIDA IS GOING TO DETERMINE IN EVERY WAY WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING YOUR THING. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING YOUR THING. YOU HAVE BEEN ORGANIZING FOLKS. IT IS THE DAY BEFORE THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTING AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY VOTES, AND WE ARE THREE DAYS AWAY FROM DIRECTING AND CHANGING THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] AND THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS , FIRST OF ALL, LET ME JUST SAY THIS. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME STRAIGHT TALK. THERE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A CHATTER ABOUT JOE AND ME IN TERMS OF, LIKE, WHAT ARE OUR VALUES, SO LET ME JUST SET IT REAL STRAIGHT , JOE AND I ARE PROUD, PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. [APPLAUSE] WHO SHARE THE VALUES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. VALUES THAT ARE ABOUT UPLIFTING AND SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES, VALUES THAT ARE ABOUT HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO SPEAKS TRUTH AND CONDUCTS HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT INSPIRES GOOD WORK, IN A WAY THAT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATING OTHER FOLKS WITH DIGNITY. JOE AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO UNDERSTANDS THEY HOLD THE OFFICE IN THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD LOOK AT TWO , TO FIGURE OUT THEIR JOB IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. THAT'S WHO WE ARE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF AT LEAST 4 CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY THIS PANDEMIC. OVER 225,000 AMERICANS IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE DIED. MANY, SO SADLY , AND MANY SO SADLY WITHOUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BEING PRESENT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. PEOPLE, WHO THEIR LAST HOURS ON THIS EARTH HAD TO BE SPENT WITHOUT HOLDING THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THEY LOVE. OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THIS VIRUS WITH UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING, OTHER LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. THE THING ABOUT THIS IS A DID , IS IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE SO BAD. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY, BUT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE NOW KNOW ON JANUARY 28 ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS VIRUS, KNEW ON JANUARY 28 WHEN HE WAS TOLD IT WAS FIVE TIMES MORE DEADLY THAN THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT IS AIRBORNE AND LETHAL, AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE SAT ON IT. HE COVERED IT UP. HE TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IT WAS A HOAX. AND HERE'S THE THING , CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE AND HOW YOU WOULD HAVE PLANNED AS A PARENT, AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, AS A TEACHER IF YOU HAD KNOWN WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28? HOW YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN READY FOR THIS? BECAUSE, REMEMBER, EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC , HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY , EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT WERE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE RENT. AND, BY THE WAY, IN A BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION, OUR BELIEF IS YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WORK ONE JOB TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PAY THE RENT, BUT IMAGINE HOW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PREPARED. HOW PEOPLE, KNOWING THAT MOST WORKING FAMILIES DON'T HAVE MORE THAN $1000 IN LIFE SAVINGS, WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE PUT ASIDE, KNOWING IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE TO SHUT DOWN FOR A WHILE. TEACHERS, PARENTS, HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE PREPARED FOR THE FACT THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF CRITICAL EDUCATION , DAYS, MONTHS, WEEKS , AND HOW WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN READY. I MEAN, I JOKE ABOUT IT, BUT HOW WE MIGHT HAVE JUST BOUGHT A COUPLE EXTRA ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER. HAD WE KNOWN. BUT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT TELL ANYBODY, YOU SEE, BECAUSE HE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS POLITICAL PROSPECTS THAN HE WAS ABOUT AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, IN THE MIDST OF THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS, DONALD TRUMP, WITH HIS BOY BILL BARR, ARE IN THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW TRYING TO SUE TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA TOGETHER WITH VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CREATED TO OFFER HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE IT, WHICH COVERED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND SAID IT'S NOT RIGHT TO DENY FOLKS COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WHO HAS DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HONK IF YOU KNOW AND LOVE SOMEBODY WITH LUPUS OR A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. [CHEERING AND HONKING] ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT AND NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGE OF THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN WHO SAYS WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF OBAMACARE, EXPAND COVERAGE, BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, BRING DOWN PREMIUMS, WE ARE GOING TO LOWER THE ELIGIBILITY AGE FOR MEDICARE TO AGE 60. JOE BIDEN SAYS THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, WE'VE GOT TO STOP THINKING ABOUT THE BODY STARTS FROM THE NECK DOWN. WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FROM THE NECK UP. THAT'S CALLED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S JOE BIDEN'S APPROACH. AND THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP, WHO WANTS TO GET RID OF ALL THESE PROTECTIONS AND HAS THE GALL TO SUGGEST AS THOUGH WE ARE NOT WATCHING THAT WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER. THERE ARE REAL CLEAR CHOICES IN THIS ELECTION. ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IN LARGE PART HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC, YOU'VE GOT OVER 30 MILLION AMERICANS WHO JUST IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE ARE LOOKING AT IN FLORIDA, ONE IN NINE FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS HAVING BEEN HUNGRY. IN FLORIDA, IN ONE IN SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED AN INABILITY OR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT. IN FLORIDA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES OUT OF BUSINESS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN. ON THE ECONOMY, HERE'S THE THING , YOU ASK JOE BIDEN HOW IS THE ECONOMY DOING, AND YOU KNOW WHAT JOE BIDEN ASKS , HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? THAT IS HOW JOE BIDEN THINKS. JOE BIDEN SAYS, YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS. JOE BIDEN SAYS I UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE GREATEST WAYS TO CREATE WEALTH IN A FAMILY IS HOMEOWNERSHIP, SO WE WILL HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN SAYS WORKING FAMILIES SHOULD NEVER PAY MORE THAN 7% OF YOUR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU GOT DONALD TRUMP, WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING, ASKS ABOUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING, ASKS ABOUT HOW RICH PEOPLE ARE DOING. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU GUYS , WE ARE GOING TO TURN EVERYBODY OUT TO EARLY VOTE TODAY AND TOMORROW, AND THOSE WHO DID NOT GET AROUND TO IT, ALTHOUGH WE WANT THEM TO GET AROUND TO IT, ARE GOING TO GET THEM TO VOTE ON ON ELECTION DAY, AND GOD WILLING WE WENT ON ELECTION DAY, JOE BIDEN AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND CORPORATIONS. AND WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES. WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT IS ABOUT BUILDING BACK UP OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES AND INVESTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT THE CREATION OF JOBS. WE ARE GOING TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM FAMILIES WHO MAKE LESS THAN $125,000 SO YOU GO TO A 4-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGE FOR FREE, INCLUDING AN HBCU, BOTH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS WHO COME OUT OF SCHOOL AND GRADUATE AND DECIDE TO GO INTO A JOB THAT MIGHT BE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT PAYS LESS THAN $125,000 AND ERASE YOUR DEBT. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE DESERVE. THESE CRISES , THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND ECONOMIC CRISIS , AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LONG OVERDUE ON RACIAL , OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [CHEERING AND HONKING] ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, A STUDENT OF AMERICAN HISTORY, SOMEONE WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH, WHO HAS THE COURAGE THEN TO SPEAK THE PHRASE BLACK LIVES MATTER. [CHEERING AND HONKING] JOE BIDEN, WHO SAYS LOOK, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO HEAR, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR SOME TO SPEAK, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH OUR HISTORY. WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENT. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES ACROSS FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR TO THE ECONOMY TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOW FIGURED OUT FROM COVID HOW THESE THINGS MANIFEST THEMSELVES TO THE POINT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO AMERICANS ARE EXPERIENCING THREE TIMES THE CONTRACTION OF COVID AND DYING AT TWICE THE RATE OF OTHER POPULATIONS. WE NEED TO SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN CONNECTION WITH CHILDBIRTH THAN OTHER WOMEN. SPEAK THE TRUTH THAT OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES OF ANYBODY IN OUR COUNTRY. AND LET'S CONFRONT THESE TRUTHS. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO AT THAT DEBATE , AT THAT DEBATE , REMEMBER THE FIRST DEBATE? REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID STAND BACK AND STAND BY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THIS WAS NOT A ONE-OFF. THERE IS A PATTERN AT PLAY HERE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO CAMPAIGNED AND CAME INTO FAME RUNNING FOR OFFICE QUESTIONING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S SEE THE PATTERN HERE WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE PEOPLE WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE, A WOMAN DIED, AND ALL THE OTHERS, THERE WERE NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, HURLING RACIAL AND ANTI-SEMITIC EPITHETS, AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ASKED, HE SAID THERE WERE FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS. BECAUSE, YOU SEE, JOE KNOWS , JOE KNOWS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF ANYONE'S STRENGTH AND IN PARTICULAR, THE TRUE MEASURE OF A LEADER'S STRENGTH IS NOT BASED ON WHO YOU BEAT DOWN. IT'S BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, LOOK, PALM BEACH, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF HEALING TO DO. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF REPAIR TO DO. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, JOE, IN HIS HEART AND IN HIS SOUL, IS COMMITTED TO UNIFYING OUR COUNTRY. JOE KNOWS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, YOUR ETHNICITY, YOUR AGE, YOUR GENDER, THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, JOE KNOWS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. [APPLAUSE AND HONKING] THE CRISIS INCLUDES , FLORIDA KNOWS THIS WELL , A CLIMATE CRISIS. YOU ALL KNOW I COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THE WEST COAST OF OUR COUNTRY, FROM CALIFORNIA, OREGON, WASHINGTON, OVER TO COLORADO HAS BEEN BURNING. I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO BE EVACUATED FROM THEIR HOMES, NEVER TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. I HAVE MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES ARE BURNING. MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. UP AND DOWN THE GULF COAST, WE HAVE SEEN FIVE NAMED STORMS JUST THIS YEAR. AND YOU KNOW YOU NAME A STORM BECAUSE IT IS REALLY BIG AND HARMFUL. WE HAVE SEEN IN THE MIDWEST FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. SO JOE SAYS, WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY AND PUT IN PLACE TIMELINES. WE NEED TO HAVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES. WE NEED TO INVEST IN SOLAR AND WIND, AND JOE KNOWS THAT ALL OF THIS IS ALSO BUILDING BACK UP OUR ECONOMY. IT WILL BE ABOUT CREATING JOBS. IT WILL BE ABOUT PARTNERING WITH THE CARPENTERS AND THE PLUMBERS AND ELECTRICIANS KNOWING THAT THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING UP THE SKILLS OF THE AMERICAN WORKFORCE TO BE A LEADER ONCE AGAIN ON A GLOBAL CRISIS ISSUE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA, THEY ASKED HIM AND BASICALLY SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, WILDFIRES ARE HAPPENING AND SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND EXTREME CONDITIONS THAT ARE HUMAN CAUSED, AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT? THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IS ALSO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDED BY SAYING SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT IS THAT? MR. PRESIDENT, SCIENCE DOES KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE HAS ENDORSED JOE BIDEN TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND HONKING] SO THERE'S A LOT TO DEAL WITH. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY VISIT TODAY AND US COMING TOGETHER THIS BEAUTIFUL AFTERNOON. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE , EVERYBODY IS A LEADER HERE. YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE IF YOU WERE NOT A LEADER, AND I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU WHAT THEY ASKED ME, AND THEY ASKED ME, KAMALA, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? PEOPLE ASK ME WHY SHOULD I VOTE? I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE. ONE IS TO HONOR THE ANCESTORS. HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [HONKING] THIS YEAR, WE JUST LOST A GREAT AMERICAN HERO IN CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS. [HONKING IN CHEERING] LET'S HONK FOR JOHN LEWIS. I KNOW HE HEARS US. I KNOW HE HEARS US. [CAR HORNS HONKING] I KNOW HE HEARS US. JOHN LEWIS, WHO SHED HIS BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE FOR THE RIGHT FOR US TO VOTE , IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE RIGHT OF BLACK FOLKS TO VOTE. JOHN LEWIS, WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS A CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT WHICH IS WHY IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE, JOHN LEWIS WAS ALSO FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, WHY JOHN LEWIS WAS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FIGHT FOR DREAMERS. JOHN LEWIS UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE CONNECTED. LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. LET'S REMEMBER THIS YEAR, WE CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT, WHICH GAVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SO LET'S HONOR ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES WHO WOULD MARCH AND SHOUT FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. WHILE WE REMEMBER HISTORY, WE MUST ALSO SPEAK TRUTH THAT NOT UNTIL 1965 COULD BLACK WOMEN VOTE, SO WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT, TOO, BUT LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. THAT'S A REASON TO VOTE. REASON NUMBER 2 , EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE HEALTH , LITERALLY THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OUR ECONOMY. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ISSUES OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. LET US ALSO TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR OUR DREAMERS. LET US TALK ABOUT THE FIGHT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER OWN BODY. LET'S TALK ABOUT RESTORING THE DIGNITY OF OUR COUNTRY ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND RESTORING THE PRINCIPLES OF A RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRACY. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE AT STAKE AND SO MUCH MORE. THE THIRD REASON TO VOTE, I BELIEVE, IS THIS , FLORIDA, WE HAVE BEEN SEEING WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY. IT IS HISTORIC IN NATURE BUT I WILL GO BACK TO RECENT HISTORY IN 2013, YOU REMEMBER THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WITH SHALL BE V HOLDER. AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, ABOUT TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE LAWS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE VOTE, TO PURGE THE VOTERS ROLLS, RIGHT? AWFUL THINGS. IN FACT, SO MUCH SO THAT NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WILL GO BACK, THE COURT THAT REVIEWED WHAT THEY DID SAID THEY WROTE THE LAW WITH "SURGICAL PRECISION" TO PREVENT BLACK PEOPLE FROM VOTING. BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, EFFORTS TO MAKE PEOPLE OF COLOR , STUDENTS, NATIVE AMERICANS , MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO VOTE. HERE IN FLORIDA, WE KNOW THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. I MEAN, I'M TRAVELING THE COUNTRY. I WAS IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, RIGHT? I WAS IN HOUSTON AS MY LAST STOP. HARRIS COUNTY , I LOVE THE WORD , HARRIS COUNTY. YOU KNOW IN TEXAS THEY PASSED A RULE FOR ONLY ONE DROPBOX PER COUNTY FOR DROPPING OFF YOUR BALLOT, AND IN HARRIS COUNTY, THAT'S 4 MILLION PEOPLE. IN OTHER STATES, THEY ARE SAYING IF YOU WANT TO VOTE BY MAIL, YOU HAVE TO FILL IT OUT AND PUT IT IN ONE ENVELOPE AND PUT THE ENVELOPE IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE, AND YOU'VE GOT TO SIGN IT AND IN OTHER PLACES, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNS IT. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO VOTE. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE US WEARY AND TIRED AND OVERWHELMED. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONFUSE US ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PROCESS. THEY EVEN STOOPED SO LOW AS TO MESS WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE! SOME OF THE NICEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE POSTAL WORKERS. [HONKING] WHY ARE THEY DOING ALL THIS? THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT MUST BE ASKED , WHY WOULD SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR CONFUSING FOR US TO VOTE? THAT IS THE QUESTION FOR US TO ASK, AND HERE IS I BELIEVE WHAT IS THE ANSWER. THEY ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO LET'S NOT EVER LET ANYONE TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. LET US ALWAYS KNOW OUR POWER. AND AT ELECTION TIME, THE POWER OF OUR VOICE IS THROUGH OUR VOTE. AND HERE IS MY LAST POINT , THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW, OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US , WHERE WERE YOU? WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? AND WHAT WE, PALM BEACH, WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT IN A PARKING LOT THIS PARTICULAR SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH KAMALA AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED AND MOBILIZED. WE WILL TELL THEM WE EMAILED AND CALLED FOLKS AND TEXTED UNTIL FOLKS GOT TIRED OF HEARING FROM US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD GET OVER IT. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE ELECTED JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING] THANK YOU, PALM BEACH. THANK YOU.

THE FIRST TWO, A PANDEMIC. I AM JUST GOING TO COME DEAR , COME DOWN HERE. [APPLAUSE] LET'S AVOID A CATASTROPHE. [LAUGHTER] OK. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FEW CRISES. FOR A LOT OF , FOR ALL OF THE FRIENDS IN THE CARS, I AM THINKING ABOUT YOU EVEN IF YOU CAN'T SEE ME. [HONKING] THERE WE GO. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF A PROPORTION WE HAVE NEVER SEEN. IT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST MASS CASUALTY WITH EVENTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SINCE WORLD WAR II. OVER 225,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. MANY OF WHOM TRAGICALLY FOR THEIR LAST DAYS ON EARTH WERE NOT ABLE TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED, TO HOLD THEIR HANDS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE VIRUS. 9 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS WITH UNTOLD LONG-TERM HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. DOCTORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE LUNG SCARRING. THE THING IS, IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. IT DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS BAD. THANKS TO BOB WOODWARD, WE KNOW THAT ON JANUARY 28, DONALD TRUMP WAS INFORMED ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS. HE WAS TOLD IT IS FIVE TIMES AS DEADLY AS THE FLU. HE WAS TOLD IT CAN IMPACT PEOPLE OF EVERY AGE. HE WAS TOLD IT WAS AIRBORNE. WHAT DID HE DO? HE COVERED THAT INFORMATION UP. HE SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS A HOAX. HE MINIMIZED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS. HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS NOW WHERE WE ARE. ON TOP OF IT, HE HAD THE GALL TO BE IN COURT WITH BILL BARR TO TRY TO SUE TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN PASSED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE. FOR THE FIRST TIME GAVE PROTECTIONS TO PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH DIABETES. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, SURVIVOR OF BREAST CANCER. [HONKING] THEY WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. THEY WANT TO SUE TO GET RID OF IT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE NEED TO EXPAND OBAMACARE. WE NEED TO EXPAND IT TO THE POINT WE BRING DOWN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. BRING DOWN THE COST OF PREMIUMS. BRING DOWN THE AGE OF MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY AT AGE 60. JOE BIDEN SAYS WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE, THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN, IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP. THAT IS CALLED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. LET'S LOOK AT THE CRISES WE ARE FACING IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS. OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT IN JUST THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN EIGHT HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING A MEMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD , IF NOT THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD , AS BEING HUNGRY. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS IS DESCRIBING AN INABILITY OR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT. HERE IN GEORGIA, ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. POTENTIALLY NEVER ABLE TO REOPEN. AGAIN, THERE IS A REAL CLEAR DIFFERENCE. ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE JOE BIDEN, WHO ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY WHEN ASKED, JOE SAYS IS YOU TELL ME HOW OUR WORKING PEOPLE , HOW ARE WORKING PEOPLE DOING? HOW ARE WORKING FAMILIES DOING? JOE SAYS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, LET'S NOT EVER RAISE TAXES ON ANYBODY MAKING LESS THAN $400,000 A YEAR. WE WILL ALSO BRING DOWN THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX RATE. WE WILL PASS A BILL THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HAVE A $15,000 TAX CREDIT FOR FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS , FOR DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS. JOE SAYS NO WORKING FAMILY SHOULD PAY MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME IN CHILDCARE. [APPLAUSE] THERE IS A REAL DIFFERENCE HERE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY , ASKS ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. ASKS ABOUT RICH PEOPLE. PASSES AS ONE OF HIS FIRST ORDERS OF BUSINESS, A TAX BILL BENEFITING THE TOP 1% AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS OF AMERICA TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT $2 TRILLION DEFICIT. WELL, GEORGIA, IF WE DO OUR THING THESE NEXT TWO DAYS AND GET ELECTED, JOE AND I ARE ABOUT TO GET RID OF THAT TAX CUT AND INVEST THAT MONEY IN WORKING FAMILIES, INVEST THAT MONEY ON BUILDING UP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS, BRIDGES, RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE ARE ABOUT TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN OUR STUDENTS COMING FROM HOMES THAT LESS THAN $125,000 TO SAY IF YOU ARE COMING FROM SUCH A HOME, YOU WILL PAY NOTHING FOR A FOUR YEAR , A FULL YEAR IN COLLEGE OR HBCU. PRIVATE OR PUBLIC. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY AND COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO HAVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT IF THEY TAKE ON A JOB IN PUBLIC SERVICE OR A JOB THAT PAYS LESS THAN 100 WHEN A $5,000 AND ERASE THEIR DEBT. WE WILL INVEST IN THE AMERICAN WORKER AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY. GEORGIA, THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. A CLEAR CHOICE. IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL, WE ARE HAVING A LONG OVERDUE RECKONING ON RACIAL INJUSTICE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] JOE BIDEN, A STUDENT OF AMERICA'S HISTORY, SOMEONE WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH, HAS THE COURAGE TO SPEAK THE PHRASE "BLACK LIVES MATTER." [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] JOE BUDDEN SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH IT. DEAL WITH THE HISTORY THAT HAS RESULTED IN STARK DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, WEALTH DISPARITIES. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THIS ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WE WILL DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA AND EXPUNGE THE RECORDS OF PEOPLE CONVICTED. WE WILL SHUT DOWN PRIVATE PRISONS. WE WILL END THE CASH BAIL SYSTEM, WHICH IS NOT ONLY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE, BUT AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. WE WILL REQUIRE BETTER POLICING. YOU WILL BANNED CHOKEHOLD, BECAUSE GEORGE FORD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF THAT WERE THE CASE. WE WILL REQUIRE A NATIONAL REGISTRY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHO BREAK THE LAW, BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T BE THEY GET TO BE FIRED IN ONE PLACE, AND GO TO ANOTHER AND GET HIRED THERE. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHEN WE SEE THAT BLACKS AND LATINOS ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO TRACK , TO CONTRACT COVID. WHEN WE SEE THAT OUR NATIVE AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES OF ANY POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY. BLACK WOMEN ARE 3-4 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN OTHER WOMEN. JOE SAYS, LET'S DEAL WITH THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP. WHO, AT THAT DEBATE , REMEMBER THAT FIRST DEBATE? AT THAT DEBATE, REFUSED TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND THEN DID NOT STOP THERE. HE DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID, "STAND BACK AND STAND BY YOUR COAT GEORGIA, HERE'S THE THING. IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS A ONE-OFF. WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR THINKING ABOUT HIS POLITICAL CAREER, HE HAD THE GALL TO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICA'S FIRST PRESIDENT. DON'T FORGET CHARLOTTESVILLE, WHERE FOLKS WERE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING RACIAL INJUSTICE. A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED. AND ON THE OTHER THERE WAS A GROUP OF NEO-NAZIS WEARING SWASTIKAS, CARRYING TIKI TORCHES, SPEWING RACIAL AND ANTI-SEMITIC EPITHETS. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID THEY WERE FINE PEOPLE ON EACH SIDE. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAID MEXICANS WERE RAPISTS. WHO HAS HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS PUT IN PLACE A MUSLIM BAN. GEORGIA, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. WE DESERVE THEM THIS. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR RACE, YOUR GENDER, OR AGE, THE LANGUAGE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, THAT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WHAT SEPARATES US. AMERICA KNOWS WE NEED A LEADER LIKE JOE BIDEN, WHO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER, WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE REAL MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT LEAST ON WHO YOU BE DOWN, IT IS BASED ON WHO YOU LIFT UP. WE HAVE A REAL CLEAR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION. NOT TO MENTION THE CRISIS YOU'RE FACING, IT IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS. I COME FROM CALIFORNIA, BUT THE WEST COAST IS BURNING. WASHINGTON, OVER TO COLORADO, WILDFIRES. I HAVE MET WITH FAMILIES EVACUATED, NEVER TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. I HAVE MET WITH FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING FIRES WHILE THEIR OWN HOMES WERE BURNING. IN FACT, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW IS A FIREFIGHTER. IN THE GULF COAST STATES. YOU'RE LOOKING AT , WE HAVE HAD FIVE NAMED STORMS JUST THIS YEAR. YOU NAME A STORM BECAUSE IT IS THAT BIG. IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODS THAT HAVE CAUSED FARMERS TO LOSE A WHOLE SEASON OF CROPS. SO, JOE BIDEN SAYS, HEY, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY OF THIS. WE NEED TO HAVE TIMELINES LIKE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2050. WE NEED TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND WIND TURBINES, AND SOLAR PANELING , AND LET US UNDERSTAND, THIS IS ABOUT THE CREATION OF JOBS. MILLIONS OF JOBS. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT EQUITY AND CIVIL RIGHTS. ALL OF THE POOR AIR QUALITY DISTRICT IN OUR COUNTRY. 70% OF THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE PLACES ARE PEOPLE OF CALLER. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP, WHO, I KID YOU NOT , SO, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTION WENT SOMETHING LIKE, SO, THE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT THERE IS HUMAN BEHAVIORS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE WILDFIRES. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDED BY SAYING, SCIENCE DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT IS THAT? HERE IS THE THING, MR. PRESIDENT. SCIENCE DOES NOW. AND SO DOES THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE THAT ENDORSED JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. THAT BRINGS ME TO TODAY. AND THIS VOTE. SO, ARE VIRTUE OF US BEING HERE TOGETHER, THIS IS A GROUP OF LEADERS. THIS IS A GROUP OF LEADERS. SO, LIKE YOU, I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY FOLKS, WHY SHOULD I VOTE? AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE REASONS. ONE, LET'S HONOR THE ANCESTORS. [APPLAUSE] HONOR THE ANCESTORS. AND GEORGIA, FOR YOU THIS IS A PARTICULAR POINT OF PRIDE. IN THAT MOST INCREDIBLE ANCESTOR WHO WAS A GREAT AMERICAN HERO BY THE NAME OF JOHN LEWIS. AND WHAT WE KNOW HE DID IN SHEDDING BLOOD ON THAT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE , HE GOT ARRESTED 40 TIMES. GOT IN GOOD TROUBLE, TOLD US TO GET IN GOOD TROUBLE. YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT JOHN , AND LUCY KNOWS THIS , HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING. JOHN ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS IS AN EXTENSION FOR OUR RIGHTS , OUR FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. JOHN WAS FRONT AND CENTER ON THE FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY, JOHN WAS FRONT AND CENTER FIGHTING FOR DR. AND FAIRNESS AND , DACA AND FAIRNESS. THAT IS THE REASON TO VOTE. TO HONOR , WE JUST CELEBRATED THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL THOSE SUFFRAGETTES IN THEIR WHITE MARCHING AND SHOUTING FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. OF COURSE, WHILE WE REMEMBER HISTORY, YOU MUST REMEMBER IT ACCURATELY. BLACK WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE UNTIL 1965. SO, WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. REASON NUMBER ONE, HONOR THE ANCESTORS. REASON NUMBER TWO, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SO MANY ISSUES. LET'S TALK ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. LET'S TALK ABOUT RENEWING PROTECTIONS FOR DACA. LET'S TALK ABOUT PAY EQUITY AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE ALL PEOPLE GET PAID EQUAL FOR EQUAL WORK. EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. REASON NUMBER THREE. THIS BRINGING , BRINGS ME BACK TO WHERE I STARTED, TALKING ABOUT THE WORK OF STACEY ABRAMS. WHICH IS THIS. WHICH IS THIS. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE COUNTRY AGAIN. I HAVE COME TO GEORGIA MANY TIMES. I WAS IN FLORIDA. I WAS IN TEXAS YESTERDAY, AND FLORIDA. I WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WAS IN MICHIGAN. NORTH CAROLINA, I'M GOING THERE AFTER I LEAVE HERE. WHAT I DON'T NEED TO TELL GEORGIA, BUT I WILL JUST REMIND US ALL. ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY , AND IN PARTICULAR SINCE 2013 AND THE SUPREME COURT EDIT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, ALMOST TWO DOZEN STATES PUT IN PLACE LAWS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE. YOU KNOW HERE IN GEORGIA THEY WERE PURGING THE VOTER ROLLS. WE HAVE SEEN IN TEXAS HOW THEY WERE PICKING UP DROP BOXES. THEY PUT A THING IN TEXAS , ONE DROPBOX PER COUNTY. I WAS IN HARRIS COUNTY, WHERE HOUSTON IS, 4 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE THERE. THEY HAVE ONE DROPBOX. IN STATES THEY ARE SAYING IF YOU DO A MAIL-IN BALLOT, HAVE TO PUT IN ONE ENVELOPE, THEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SEAL THAT, AND PUT IT IN ANOTHER ENVELOPE, BUT IN SOME PLACES YOU'VE GOT TO BE CASH YOU GET TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE , YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNED IT? TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT. THERE WERE EVEN MESSING WITH THE POST OFFICE. THE POST OFFICE. I MEAN, THE NICEST PEOPLE WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE. AND SO, WE HAVE GOT TO ASK, WHY DO YOU THINK SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? AND I DO BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. [APPLAUSE] THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN. SO, LET US NOT LET EVER ANYBODY TAKE OUR POWER FROM US. IT IS OURS. AT ELECTION TIME, THE POWER OF OUR VOICE IS THROUGH OUR VOTE AND WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED. WE WILL NOT BE SIDELINED. WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. [APPLAUSE] AND HERE IS MY LAST POINT. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS MY LAST POINT. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS, AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN, AND OTHERS, THEY WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT? AND WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST HOW WE FELT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. [APPLAUSE] WE WILL TELL THEM ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND WE WERE HANGING OUT IN A PARKING LOT TOGETHER. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE ORGANIZED AND MOBILIZED. WE WILL TELL THEM HOW WE CALLED AND TEXTED EVERYBODY WE KNEW TO THE POINT THAT THEY GOT TIRED OF US, BUT WE KNEW THEY WOULD GET OVER IT. AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE ELECTED JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU ALL.

CSPANKH211202040	Kamala Harris	2020-11-02	Senator Kamala Harris Holds Drive-In Rally in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley	Hi. Oh, it's so good to see everybody. Maria, Thank you for that introduction. Where is she? Thank you for that introduction. It's so good to be with you guys and my friend Bob Casey and everybody Look at this incredible group of leaders. Look, A this look at this. And yes, the path to the White House leads through Pennsylvania. Yes, it does. And you are gonna make it happen. You are going to make it happen. Yeah. So I'm so glad to be with you this afternoon. You know, we're all here in Jos, in Pennsylvania. Jill's in Pennsylvania. Doug's in Pennsylvania. I'm in Pennsylvania. You're in Pennsylvania? Where? In Pennsylvania. We're all here is happening right here. And this is Biden Country in that. That's right. That's right. So we're ready to get this done. We're gonna get this done. Tomorrow's election day in about 24 hours. Pennsylvania will determine who will be the next president of the United States. Mhm. And, you know, I did an event earlier, and I just decided, You know, I'm kind of done talking about the guy in the White House. So if you all don't mind, I'm just gonna talk about Joe. Let's talk about Joe. Let's do that. Let's do that. So, you know, Joe has been talking about the fact that this is a moment that really requires riel leadership in our country because we're going through so many crises that all hit at the same time. And so Joe talks about four crises in particular, um, one about obviously this public health pandemic, right? It's killed over 225,000 Americans in just the last several months. And you know what breaks everybody's heart is knowing how many people spent their last hours days on Earth without ah family member nearby. You know, from any of us, I have experienced losing a family member that you love and not being able to actually just being with them and hold their hands in those last hours off. Nine million people have contracted this virus. Doctors were talking about the long term health consequences, including things like lung scarring. And here's the thing. It didn't have to be this way. It didn't have to be this bad. If we had had really leadership in the White House. And you know, here's the thing. Now remember, Joe's been out of office, but back in March, not having the first half firsthand information that we know you know who had thanks to Bob Woodward, let's always thank him. Okay, but Joe, back in March without the inside information, said, I know what this is. I know it is serious and we should take it seriously and put in place a plan. Joe had a plan back in March because, remember, Joe has dedicated his life to public service. Joe was there to deal with Ebola. Joe knows the responsibility off the the highest office in the land to deal with issues like this. So back in March, Joe talked about a plan Joe understands. When we're dealing with a public health crisis, we need to kick in one of the most fundamental responsibilities of government, which is to concern itself with the health and well being of the American people. Joe understood that back when would he and President Obama, Barack Obama, President Joe Biden vice president, pushed through the Affordable Care Act, which was one of the most major and influential public policies we have seen some Social Security. It brought health care to over 20 million people that didn't have it. It protected people with preexisting conditions. Raise your hand or hook if you know somebody with diabetes or high blood pressure or Lupus or breast cancer Survivor And you know, I mean, Pennsylvania knows Joe more than most. He's been far too much time in the hospital with the people he loves. He knows that what we're talking about. Health care. It's about understanding that nobody should suffer that nobody should go through unnecessary pain simply because they don't have enough money in their back pocket. Joe knows that access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. So everything's at stake in this election. Because Joe is saying, unlike the other guy who's trying to get rid of the affordable care act, Joe saying No, we're gonna build on my success, meaning his success, and we're gonna expand protections. We're gonna bring down the cost of premiums, bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We're gonna lower eligibility for Medicare to age 60. We're gonna deal with the fact that When we're talking about health care, you gotta understand the body doesn't just start from the neck down. It also includes the neck up, and that's called mental health care. There's a real choice in this election. Joe talks about the fact that we're in the midst of an economic crisis, in large part because of this pandemic. But look, we also know even before the pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay the rent and put food on the table. Joe understands that in the America we believe in, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay the rent and put food on their table. Joe says You want to talk to me about the economy and asked me how the economy is doing. Then I ask you, how are working people doing? How are working families doing? Joe understands that when they passed that tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America causing us to deal with a $2 trillion deficit, that that wasn't about working people and if we get done what we need to get done. Pennsylvania in the next 24 hours Zhou and are about to get rid of that tax bill and invest that money in working families. Invest that money in infrastructure building, back up our roads and bridges, partnering with the building trades, the carpenters and the plumbers and the electrician's knowing their apprenticeship programs are the best in the world. Building up America's workforce. Investing in our auto industry, making our auto industry the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Investing in working families, not raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year but also investing in working families. Knowing you should never pay more than 7% in your income in child care. Investing in our students who come from families who make less than 100,000. Ah, $125,000 saying, if you go to a four year public school, including an HBCU, you will go for free. That's how Joe thinks about the economy. There's a really clear choice in this race. Let's deal with what Joe being a student of American history and having the courage to speak truth knows we need to do with a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice. in America. Joe has the courage to speak a term the other guy will never say. Black lives matter. Joe knows. Look, it may be uncomfortable for some folks to here, but we got to deal with this. We have to deal with the fact that blacks and Latinos have been three times likely to contract covert twice as likely to die from it. We need to deal with the fact that our native brothers and sisters have the highest rates of diabetes of any population in our country. We need to deal with these things. Joe knows that we are done with a so called leader who has spent full time trying to so hate and division between us trying to get Americans to turn on each other. We're done with that. Yeah, and Joe knows that the true measure of strength of any human being is measured not based on who you beat down. It's measured based on who you lift up. There's a really clear choice in this election. Joe talks about the climate crisis because he's clear about that, too. He's clear about the fact that you know you, you all know I come from California he's clear that the West Coast is burning from California, Oregon, Washington, over to Colorado. Wildfires. I've met with families who are evacuated never to be able to return to their home firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother in law's a firefighter up and down the Gulf Coast states, people being battered by those storms. You know there have been five named storms this year alone, and you know they name a storm because it's really bad in the Midwest, farmers that have lost the whole season of crops because of the floods, Joe says. We need to embrace the science we need to see. This is an imminent knocking on our door harm, and we need to get to it. But Joe sees in a moment of crisis ah, moment of opportunity that this is the time then to invest in infrastructure, invest in renewable energy. Invest as I said earlier, not auto industry and our investment in being the greatest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Because, you see, that's the kind of Leader Joe is. And Pennsylvania, you know, Joe, you know, Joe Joe has seen more hardship than most should ever have to experience. Joe has suffered more loss than anybody really should have to suffer. And I'm gonna tell you something about Joe that I know. And I know, you know, in the midst of any crisis he has faced, he sees always, ah, moment where hard work and determination and faith can see you through to see the opportunity of the moment and on all of these issues. That's where he's at because he believes in the American people. And he believes in the strength of who we are as a nation. So I'm here to thank you all for everything you've been doing these last years, months, days, hours, I'm here to remind you. I mean, if you're here, your leader So I'm here to remind us all that we still got a lot of time and a lot of work left to do before this election is over. A lot of work to Dio, and we want to make sure everyone votes and and and as leaders, I'm sure you have been approached with a question I have been approached with, Which is why should I vote. And essentially, I believe there are three reasons that all of us should vote one. Let's honor the ancestors. Let's honor the ancestors. You know, this year we lost a great American hero, Congressman John Lewis, John Lewis, who fought, who shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge for our right to vote and the right for black people to vote in America. Let's honor the ancestors. This year we celebrated the passage of the 19th Amendment because those suffragettes 100 years ago in all their white were marching and shouting, saying, Women have a right to vote to. And let's always Bethlehem also be true to history. Black women couldn't vote until 1965. Got to deal with that. But let's honor the ancestors because they imagined a moment like this where they wanted us to stand up for our rights and stand up for our ideals. So that's a reason to vote. Reason number two. Everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. The future of our democracy are standing around the world. Our commitment to working people, our commitment to the dignity and integrity of our leaders and each one of us. Everything is at stake. Number three. You know, I've been traveling the country I've been here in Pennsylvania before, of course. And I was just in Georgia. I was in North Carolina. I was in Texas and Florida just in the last couple days. Um, all over our country, you know that there have been very, very serious attempts being made now for years to try and suppress the vote attempts to try and make it difficult and confusing for people to vote. I mean, look, in Texas, you know, they were picking up drop boxes. They said there would could only be one dropbox per county. I was in Houston the other day, um, in in in Harris County. I was in Houston, in Harris County. Four million people live in that county, one dropbox in various states. They're saying if you vote by mail, you gotta fill out your ballot and put it in one envelope, and then you gotta pull it in a second envelope, and then you got to sign it right here, but in some other states, and then you have to have a third person sign it. Yeah, I'd like a different person. It bananas, right? And so all of this is happening, right? E mean, you even got. I mean, they're even messing with the post office like the post office. The nicest people work for the post office. They're messing with post office and you gotta and the senses. And what what we have to do, though in this moment is asked, Why do you think so many powerful people are going out of their way to try and make it difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I do believe it is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let's not let anyone take our power from us. We will not be sidelined. We will not be silenced. We know our power. And my final point then is this. This moment will pass. And years from now, our Children, our grandchildren and others, they're gonna look in our face. They're gonna look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, Where were you at that moment? They will ask us, where were you? And here's the thing I know We will tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them we organized. We will tell them we mobilized. We will tell them We emailed and we texted and we call till folks got sick of us. But we knew They get over it and we will tell them Bethlehem that we elected Joe Biden the next president of the United States. Thank you.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477691-1/senator-kamala-harris-holds-drive-rally-pennsylvanias-lehigh-valley	2020 Democratic vice presidential nomninee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) spoke at a drive-in Biden Campaign rally in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Lehigh Valley.	477691-1	Speech

(music) HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING? Y'ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING? THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. I WANT TO TELL YOU A BIT MORE ABOUT MYSELF SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE MY HEART IS. I AM NOT JUST A BARBER, I AM A GOD-FEARING MAN WHO LOVES MY FAMILY, AND I LOVE TO BE IN BUSINESS HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY TODAY IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. THEY SAY THIS ELECTION IS A BATTLE OF THE SOUL OF THE NATION. WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TOMORROW TO PUT MORE SO IN OUR NATION, THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. MY WIFE AND I HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAINING OF OUR CHILDREN AND WERE THEY SHOULD GO. BUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE ALONE, BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A FAMILY. ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH KAMALA HARRIS AT A VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, SHE BECAME AN ADDITIONAL ROLE MODEL FOR MY DAUGHTER. LET ME TELL YOU WHY. SHE HANDLED THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH GRACE. IF THERE IS ANYBODY THAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING, I WANT MY DAUGHTER QUOTING KEMAL AND NOT CARDI. EXCUSE ME, MR. VICE PRESIDENT, I'M TALKING. WHEN I LOOK AT , [INAUDIBLE] , BUT YOUR CHILDREN TO DREAM BIGGER, TO WALK TALLER, BECAUSE OF HAVING INSPIRATIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONNECTED. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HEART, WHO UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLES THAT WE ALL GO THROUGH AS CITIZENS WITHIN PENNSYLVANIA, AS CITIZENS WITHIN AMERICA. WHEN I LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ELECTED OFFICIALS IN OFFICE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS ON THE BALLOT. I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK ABOUT , THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST LIKE ANY SPORTS TEAM. WE CANNOT JUST HAVE OUR STAR PLAYERS. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EVERY OTHER ROLE PLAYER THAT IS ELECTED BY US TO BE A PART OF THAT WINNING TEAM. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET, WE DO NEED OUR STARS. BUT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR THE REST OF THE TEAM THAT IS NEEDED FOR US TO WIN. [CARS HONKING] [APPLAUSE] PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE A FIRST-CLASS STATE. WE ARE FIRST-CLASS CITIZENS. I NEED US TO SHOW UP TOMORROW IN DROVES AND SHOW THE REST OF AMERICA HOW WE CAN BLOW TRUMP OUT OF THE WATER WITH A BLOWOUT! [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] IT AIN'T GOING TO BE CLOSE! [APPLAUSE] WE NEED TO BE LEADERS IN THIS BLOWOUT. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE ARE PUTTING IN LEADERS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE CONNECTED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ALLIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE CAN HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES IN OFFICE. WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PLANS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH CARE IN OFFICE. INDIVIDUALS IN OFFICE THAT HAVE PLANS TO SUPPORT HBCUS. [APPLAUSE] WHAT I NEED FROM ALL OF US IS TO GET OUT TO VOTE. I NEED FROM ALL OF US TO TELL OTHERS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. I NEED ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE WE KNOW IS CHARGED UP WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS TO PUT THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN TRULY WIN. [CARS HONKING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PRIVILEGED TO INTRODUCE , I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAN EVERYONE GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR NEW VICE PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [MARY J. BLIGE'S ["WORK THAT" PLAYS] (music) (music) GIRL, LIVE YOUR LIFE DON'T SWEAT, GIRL, BE YOURSELF FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME, FOLLOW ME WORK YOUR THING OUT (LET 'EM GET MAD, THEY GONNA HATE ANYWAY) WORK YOUR THING OUT YEAH YEAH, WORK WHAT YOU GOT I'M TALKING 'BOUT THINGS THAT I KNOW (music) (music) HELLO, PENNSYLVANIA! ARE YOU READY? [APPLAUSE] JOE IS HERE! YOU ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! [APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE HERE TO BRING THIS ELECTION HOME. BUT WE'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY. THAT IS IT. ONE MORE DAY. JOE AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR PRAYERS, YOUR LOVE, YOUR COURAGE , VOLUNTEERING AND MAKING CALLS. FOR YOUR TRUST IN US. AND FOR YOUR VOTE. AND AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, AS WE HEAD INTO TOMORROW, I KNOW WE ARE EMPOWERED. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF UNITY. WE KNOW THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WENZHOU ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET , WHEN JOE ASKED ME TO JOIN THIS TICKET, SAYING YES WAS EASY. HE AND I DON'T COME FROM THE SAME BACKGROUNDS, BUT WE WERE RAISED WITH THE SAME VALUES , HARD WORK, HONESTY, DECENCY, A BELIEF THAT WE ALL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I HAVE SEEN WHEN I HAVE TRAVELED ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 84 DAYS. THE VALUES WE SHARE AS AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. YOU CAN FEEL. YOU CAN FEEL THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL TOWN, WEARING MASKS AND SOCIALLY DISTANCING. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE LINING THE STREETS AND GATHERING ON CORNERS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. THEY ARE BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN. HOLDING UP SIGNS. WEARING THEIR COLORS AND STROLLING TO THE POLLS! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] AND WAVING THE RED WHITE AND BLUE! [APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] THE ENERGY OUT THERE IS REAL. AND IT IS INSPIRING. IN THIS BATTLE FOR THE VERY SOUL OF OUR NATION, WE HAVE SEEN WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. WE HAVE SEEN WHO WE ARE. AND A WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. AND THAT IS WHY I KNOW THAT TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HONK IF YOU HAVE VOTED. ]AND IF YOU HAVE NOT, FIND OUT WHEN AND WHERE YOU WILL GO TOMORROW. THERE IS STILL ALMOST 20 FOUR HOURS WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS DONE. HONK IF YOU HAVE BEEN SENDING TEXT AND MAKING CALLS TO GET OUT THE VOTE. [CARS HONKING] BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW FROM THE TIME THE POLLS OPEN TOMORROW MORNING UNTIL THEY CLOSE, EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. WE CANNOT LET UP BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER. AND EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. OUR HEALTH, OUR ECONOMY, OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HER OWN BODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TREATS ALL PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW. A SUPREME COURT THAT IT ADVANCES THE LEGACY OF JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. THAT LIVES UP, LIVES UP TO THE PHRASE ABOVE ITS ENTRANCE, EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO BE. THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE. IT IS ALL ON THE LINE. THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. THE DECISION WE MAKE WILL WITHOUT QUESTION LAST FOR GENERATIONS. AS I TRAVEL AROUND, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES ON EVERYONE'S MIND IS THE PANDEMIC. THAT IS RAVAGING OUR COUNTRY. REMEMBER, BACK IN JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP NEW JUST HOW BAD THE CORONAVIRUS WAS. THAT IT WAS DEADLY AND AIRBORNE. BUT WHAT DID HE DO WITH THAT INFORMATION? HE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERAS AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIED ABOUT IT. HE COVERED IT UP. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD KNOWN ON JANUARY 28 WHAT HE KNEW? WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE, WHAT YOUR FAMILY MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREPARE? CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? HOW WE AS A COUNTRY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREPARE? BUT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. HE ONLY THINKS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR HIMSELF. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE LOST 230,000 LIVES TO COVID. SO MANY PEOPLE FORCED TO DIE ALONE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS VIRUS. 230,000 AMERICANS. THE LAST TIME WE EXPERIENCED LOSS LIKE THIS WAS WORLD WAR II. IN ADDITION, WE ARE LOOKING AT OVER 9 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE VIRUS AND WE KNOW IT IS HITTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST.  ATINOS ARE CONTRACTING COVID AT THREE TIMES THE RATE OF OTHERS. LET'S BE CLEAR. WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS WE HAVE FACED SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO CONTAIN THIS VIRUS, HE FAILED TO LEAD. 23 MILLION PEOPLE ARE SEEING UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE IN FIVE MOTHERS WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 12 IS DESCRIBING HER CHILDREN AS BEING HUNGRY. IN AMERICA. IN ONE IN SIX HOUSEHOLDS, FOLKS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND CONCERNED THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY. AND YET NINE MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC, THIS PRESIDENT STILL DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN TO CONTAIN IT. WE HAVE WITNESSED THE GREATEST FAILURE OF A PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. [CARS HONKING] ON TOP OF IT ALL, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN COURT TRYING TO END THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TAKE HEALTH COVERAGE AWAY FROM OVER 20 MILLION AMERICANS. HE'S TRYING TO END PROTECTIONS FOR THE OVER 100 MILLION AMERICANS WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA, DIABETES , HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR CANCER. HONK IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WITH DIABETES. MORE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR ASTHMA, OR CANCER. AMERICA, WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. THE FIRST THING JOE AND I WILL DO WHEN WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS GET THIS VIRUS UNDER CONTROL. [CARS HONKING] WE WILL LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. WE WILL PROVIDE FREE TESTING AND TREATMENT AND, WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, A SAFE VACCINE FOR ALL. WE WILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE OPEN SAFELY AND WE WILL BILL BACK AN ECONOMY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. JOE AND I WILL NOT INCREASE TAXES ON ANYONE MAKING UNDER $400,000 A YEAR. PERIOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] BUT WE WILL ASK THE SUPER WEALTHY AND THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND WE WILL INVEST THOSE TAX DOLLARS TO REBUILD OUR NATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATE MILLIONS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. MAKE CHILDCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND INVEST IN OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. WE WILL BUILD ON OBAMACARE AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE BODY DOES NOT START FROM THE NECK DOWN. IT INCLUDES THE NECK UP AND IT DESERVES THE HEALTH CARE THAT ALL PEOPLE NEED. WE WILL LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND PROTECT AND EXPAND MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE WILL WORK TO ROOT OUT THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT STILL EXISTS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE WILL CONFRONT, NOT CONDONE, WHITE SUPREMACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] AND PENNSYLVANIA, WE WILL BEGIN THE WORK OF HEALING AND REPAIRING AND UNITING OUR NATION. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS OVERCOME OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. TOGETHER. JOE GETS THAT. JOE UNDERSTANDS THAT. YOU SEE, JOE IS A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. HE SEES US AND HE UNDERSTANDS SUFFERING BECAUSE HE HAS EXPERIENCED SO MUCH OF IT HIMSELF. JOE BIDEN IS A LEADER OF STRENGTH AND EMPATHY. TOUGHNESS AND HUMILITY. HE UNDERSTANDS THE MEASURE OF A PERSON'S STRENGTH IS NOT WHO YOU PUT DOWN, IT IS WHO YOU LIFT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] HE KNOWS NO MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHERE WE LIVE, RACE, GENDER, BACKGROUND OR FAITH, NO MATTER HOW WE IDENTIFY OR WHO WE LOVE, NO MATTER THE LANGUAGE A GRANDMOTHER SPEAKS, WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. [CARS HONKING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REMEMBER THIS. YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOICE IS YOUR POWER. AND DO NOT LET ANYONE TAKE YOUR POWER FROM YOU. NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP. NOW IS THE TIME TO SPEAK OUT. NOW IS THE TIME TO VOTE AND VOTE LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CARS HONKING] OUR DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. IN THIS ELECTION, LET'S ABOUT LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT, VOTE LIKE JUSTICE, EQUALITY, AND OPPORTUNITY, CHARACTER, AND DIGNITY ARE ON THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THEY ARE. AND ONE DAY, ONE DAY, OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK US IN THE EYE, EACH ONE OF US, AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHAT DID YOU DO AT THAT MOMENT? I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY, WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR FUTURE. SO LET'S DO THAT. LET'S VOTE, BUT WITH CONVICTION AND CONFIDENCE AND HOPE, AND LET US ELECT JOE BIDEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, MAY GOD BLESS YOU, AND MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA.	https://www.c-span.org/video/?477692-1/john-legend-senator-kamala-harris-biden-campaign-rally-philadelphia	2020 vice presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) and singer John Legend spoke at a drive-in Biden campaign drive-in in Philadelphia.	477692-1	Speech
CSPANKH711202042	Kamala Harris	2020-11-07	Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Victory Speeches	THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. SO CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, BEFORE HIS PASSING, WROTE "DEMO CRACY IS NOT A STATE, IT IS AN ACT." WHAT HE MEANT WAS AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY IS NOT GUARANTEED. IT IS ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT FOR IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO GUARD IT AND NEVER TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY TAKES STRUGGLE. IT TAKES SACRIFICE. BUT THERE IS JOY IN IT. AND THERE IS PROGRESS, BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHEN OUR VERY DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT IN THIS ELECTION, WITH THE VERY SOUL OF AMERICA AT STAKE, AND THE WORLD WATCHING, YOU USHERED IN A NEW DAY FOR AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] THROUGH , YOUR CAMPAIGN STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS, THIS EXTRAORDINARY TEAM, THANK YOU FOR BRINGING MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER BEFORE INTO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] AND FOR MAKING THIS VICTORY POSSIBLE, TO THE POLL WORKERS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO MAKE SURE EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED, OUR NATION OWES YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE PROTECTED THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP OUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY, THANK YOU FOR TURNING OUT IN RECORD NUMBERS TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW TIMES HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING, ESPECIALLY THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THE GRIEF, SORROW, AND PAIN. THE WORRIES AND THE STRUGGLES. BUT WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED YOUR COURAGE, YOUR RESILIENCE, AND THE GENEROSITY OF YOUR SPIRIT. FOR FOUR YEARS, YOU MARCHED AND ORGANIZED FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE, FOR OUR LIVES, AND FOR OUR PLANET. AND THEN, YOU VOTED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND JOE IS A HEALER, A UNITER, A TESTED AND STEADY HAND. A PERSON WHOSE OWN EXPERIENCE OF LOSS GIVES HIM A SENSE OF PURPOSE THAT WILL HELP US AS A NATION RECLAIM OUR OWN SENSE OF PURPOSE. AND A MAN WITH A BIG HEART WHO LOVES WITH ABANDON. IT IS HIS LOVE FOR JILL, WHO WILL BE AN INCREDIBLE FIRST LADY , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHILE I FIRST KNEW JOE AS VICE PRESIDENT, I REALLY GOT TO KNOW HIM AS THE FATHER WHO LOVED BEAU. MY DEAR FRIEND, WHO WE REMEMBER HERE TODAY. AND TO MY HUSBAND DOUG , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO JOE AND JILL FOR WELCOMING OUR FAMILY INTO THEIRS ON THIS INCREDIBLE JOURNEY. AND TO THE WOMAN MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR MY PRESENCE HERE TODAY, MY MOTHER, WHO IS ALWAYS IN OUR HEARTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] WHEN SHE CAME HERE FROM INDIA AT THE AGE OF 19, SHE DID NOT QUITE IMAGINE THIS MOMENT, BUT SHE BELIEVES SO DEEPLY IN AN AMERICA WHERE A MOMENT LIKE THIS IS POSSIBLE. SO I AM THINKING ABOUT HER AND THE GENERATIONS OF WOMEN, BLACK WOMEN , [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ASIAN, WHITE, LATINA, NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO SURROUND OUR NATION , WHO THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY HAVE PAVED THE WAY FOR THIS MOMENT TONIGHT. WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR EQUALITY AND LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. INCLUDING THE BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT SO OFTEN PROVE THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED TO SECURE AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR OVER A CENTURY. 100 YEARS AGO WAS THE 19TH AMENDMENT. 55 YEARS AGO WAS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. AND NOW IN 2020, WITH A NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY WHO CAST THEIR BALLOTS AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE AND BE HEARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] TONIGHT I REFLECT ON THEIR STRUGGLE, THEIR DETERMINATION, AND THE STRENGTH OF THEIR VISION TO SEE WHAT CAN BE UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN. AND I STAND ON THEIR SHOULDERS. AND WHAT A TESTAMENT IT IS TO JOE'S CHARACTER THAT HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO BREAK ONE OF THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS THAT EXISTS IN OUR COUNTRY AND SELECT A WOMAN AS HIS VICE PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] BECAUSE EVERY LITTLE GIRL WATCHING TONIGHT SEES THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY OF POSSIBILITIES. AND TO THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTRY, REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER, OUR COUNTRY HAS SENT YOU A CLEAR MESSAGE, DREAM WITH AMBITION. LEAD WITH CONVICTION. SEE YOURSELVES IN A WAY THAT OTHERS MAY NOT, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. BUT KNOW THAT WE WILL APPLAUD YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTED FOR, I WILL STRIVE TO BE A VICE PRESIDENT, LIKE JOE WAS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA , LOYAL, HONEST, AND PREPARED. WAKING UP EVERY DAY THINKING OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. BECAUSE NOW IS WHEN THE REAL WORK BEGINS. THE HARD WORK. THE NECESSARY WORK. THE GOOD WORK. THE ESSENTIAL WORK TO SAVE LIVES AND BEAT THIS EPIDEMIC. TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY SO IT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE. TO ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN OUR SOCIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY. TO COMBAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS. TO UNITE OUR COUNTRY AND HEAL THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAVE ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHO REPRESENTS THE BEST IN US. A LEADER THE WORLD WILL RESPECT AND OUR CHILDREN WILL LOOK UP TO. A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO WILL RESPECT OUR TROOPS AND KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE, AS A PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IT IS NOW MY GREAT HONOR TO INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) [HONKING] (music) [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (music) [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT ME TO DANCE, DELAWARIANS. I SEE MY BUDDY TOM CARPENTER DOWN THERE.

THEY HAVE DELIVERED US A CLEAR VICTORY. A CONVINCING VICTORY. A VICTORY FOR WE, THE PEOPLE. WE WON WITH THE MOST VOTES EVER CAST ON A PRESIDENTIAL TICKET IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION. 74 MILLION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL I MUST ADMIT IT SURPRISED ME. TONIGHT WE ARE SEEING ALL OVER THIS NATION, ALL CITIES AND ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INDEED ACROSS THE WORLD, AN OUTPOURING OF JOY, OF HOPE, RENEWED FAITH IN TOMORROW TO BRING A BETTER DAY. AND I'M HUMBLED BY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE YOU HAVE PLACED IN ME. I PLEDGE TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO SEEKS NOT TO DIVIDE, BUT UNIFY. WHO DOESN'T SEE RED STATES AND BLUE STATES, ONLY SEES THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WORK WITH ALL MY HEART WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL OF YOU. AND FOR THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE AMERICA IS ABOUT. IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR ADMINISTRATION WILL BE ALL ABOUT. I SOUGHT THIS OFFICE TO RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA, TO REBUILD THE BACKBONE OF THIS NATION, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND TO MAKE AMERICA RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO UNITE US HERE AT HOME. IT IS THE HONOR OF MY LIFETIME THAT SO MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE VOTED FOR THAT VISION. NOW THE WORK OF MAKING THAT VISION IS REAL. FOLKS, AS I SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, I'M JILL'S HUSBAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE WITHOUT HER LOVE AND TIRELESS SUPPORT. AND MY SON HUNTER AND MY DAUGHTER AND ALL OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSES AND ALL OUR FAMILY. THEY ARE MY HEART. JILL IS A MILITARY MOM, AN EDUCATOR. SHE DEDICATED HER LIFE TO EDUCATION. TEACHING IS NOT JUST WHAT SHE DOES, IT IS WHO SHE IS. FOR AMERICAN EDUCATORS, IT IS A GREAT DAY FOR Y'ALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WILL HAVE THE HONOR , YOU JUST HEARD FROM KAMALA HARRIS. WHO WILL MAKE HISTORY AS THE FIRST WOMAN, THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN FROM SOUTH ASIAN DESCENT, THE FIRST IMMIGRANT EVER ELECTED TO THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DON'T TELL ME IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S LONG OVERDUE. AND WE ARE REMINDED TONIGHT OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT SO HARD FOR SO MANY YEARS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ONCE AGAIN AMERICA HAS BENT THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE MORE TOWARD JUSTICE. KAMALA, DOUG, LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU'RE FAMILY. YOU HAVE BECOME AN HONORARY BIDEN. THERE IS NO WAY OUT. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO VOLUNTEERED AND WORKED THE POLLS IN THIS PANDEMIC, LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS, YOU DESERVE A SPECIAL THANKS FROM THE ENTIRE NATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND TO MY CAMPAIGN TEAM AND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND ALL WHO GAVE SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES TO MAKE THIS MOMENT POSSIBLE, IOU EVERYTHING , I OWE YOU EVERYTHING. ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED US, I AM PROUD OF THE CAMPAIGN WE BUILT AND RAN. I AM PROUD OF THE COALITION WE PUT TOGETHER. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, PROGRESSIVES, MODERATES, CONSERVATIVE, YOUNG, OLD, RURAL, SUBURBAN, GAY, STRAIGHT, TRANSGENDER, NATIVE AMERICAN. I MADE IT, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE CAMPAIGN WAS AT ITS SLOWEST, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN IMMUNITY , COMMUNITY STOOD UP AGAIN FOR ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ALL HAD MY BACK AND I WILL HAVE YOURS. I SAID AT THE OUTSET, I WANTED TO REPRESENT THIS CAMPAIGN, TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AMERICA. WE HAVE DONE THAT. FOR ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, I UNDERSTAND THE DISAPPOINTMENT TONIGHT. I LOST A COUPLE TIMES MYSELF. NOW LET'S GIVE EACH OTHER A CHANCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] IT IS TIME TO PUT AWAY THE HARSH RHETORIC, LOWER THE TEMPERATURE, SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, LISTEN TO EACH OTHER AGAIN, AND TO MAKE PROGRESS, WE HAVE TO STOP TREATING OUR OPPONENTS AS AN ENEMY. THEY ARE NOT OUR ENEMIES, THEY ARE AMERICANS. THEY ARE AMERICANS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BIBLE TELLS US TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON, A TIME TO BUILD, A TIME TO REAP AND A TIME TO SOW AND A TIME TO HEAL. THIS IS THE TIME TO HEAL IN AMERICA. [HONKING] NOW THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER, WHAT IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? WHAT IS OUR MANDATE? I BELIEVE IT IS THIS , AMERICA HAS CALLED UPON US TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF DECENCY, THE FORCES OF FAIRNESS, TO MARSHAL THE FORCES OF SCIENCE AND FORCES OF HOPE IN THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR TIME. THE BATTLE TO CONTROL THE VIRUS. THE BATTLE TO BUILD PROSPERITY. THE BATTLE TO SECURE YOUR FAMILY'S HEALTH CARE. THE BATTLE TO ACHIEVE RACIAL JUSTICE AND ROOT OUT SYSTEMIC RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THE BATTLE TO SAVE OUR PLANET BY GETTING CLIMATE UNDER CONTROL. THE BATTLE TO RESTORE DECENCY, DEFEND DEMOCRACY, AND GIVE EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY A FAIR SHOT. THAT IS ALL THEY ARE ASKING FOR, A FAIR SHOT. FOLKS, OUR WORK BEGINS WITH GETTING COVID UNDER CONTROL. WE CANNOT REPAIR THE ECONOMY OR RELISH LIFE'S MOST PRECIOUS MOMENTS HUGGING OUR GRANDCHILDREN, BIRTHDAYS, GRADUATIONS, ALL THE MOMENTS THAT MATTER MOST TO US, UNTIL WE GET IT UNDER CONTROL. ON MONDAY, I WILL NAME A GROUP OF LEADING SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AS TRANSITION ADVISORS TO HELP TAKE THE BIDEN-HARRIS PLAN AND CONVERT IT INTO AN ACTION BLUEPRINT THAT WILL RESTORE IT ON JANUARY 2020, 20 - - 20, 2021. THAT PLAN WILL BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF COMPASSION, EMPATHY AND CONCERN. I WILL SPARE NO EFFORT, NONE, OR ANY COMMITMENT TO TURN AROUND THIS PANDEMIC. FOLKS, I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT I WILL GOVERN AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT. I WILL WORK AS HARD FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME AS THOSE WHO DID. LET THIS GRIM ERA OF DEMONIZATION IN AMERICA BEGIN TO END HERE AND NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REFUSAL OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER IS NOT SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, IT IS A DECISION, A CHOICE WE MAKE. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO COOPERATE, WE CAN DECIDE TO COOPERATE. I BELIEVE THIS IS PART OF THE MANDATE GIVEN TO US FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY WANT US TO COOPERATE IN THEIR INTERESTS. THAT IS THE CHOICE I WILL MAKE. I WILL CALL ON CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, TO MAKE THAT CHOICE WITH ME. THE AMERICAN STORY IS ABOUT A , ABOUT SLOW, YET WIDENING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN AMERICA. TOO MANY DREAMS HAVE BEEN DIFFERED FOR TOO , DEFERRED FOR TOO LONG. NO MATTER THEIR RACE, FAITH, IDENTITY OR DISABILITY. FOLKS, AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SHAPED BY INFLECTION POINTS, BY MOMENTS IN TIME WHERE WE MADE OUR DECISIONS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE. LINCOLN IN 1860 COMING TO SAVE THE UNION. FDR IN 1932 PROMISING A BELEAGUERED COUNTRY A NEW DEAL. JFK IN 1960 PLEDGING A NEW FRONTIER. AND 12 YEARS AGO, WHEN BARACK OBAMA MADE HISTORY, HE TOLD US YES, WE CAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HONKING] FOLKS, WE STAND AT AN INFLECTION POINT. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT DESPAIR, TO BUILD PROSPERITY AND PURPOSE. WE CAN DO IT. I LONG TALKED ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. WE MUST RESTORE THE SOUL OF AMERICA. OUR NATION IS SHAPED BY THE CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN OUR BETTER ANGELS AND OUR DARKEST IMPULSES. IT'S TIME FOR OUR BETTER ANGELS TO PREVAIL. TONIGHT, THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING AMERICA. AND I BELIEVE AT OUR BEST, AMERICA IS A BEACON FOR THE GLOBE. WE WILL LEAD NOT ONLY BY THE EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED, AND MANY HEARD MY H , HEARD ME SAY WE CAN DEFINE AMERICA IN ONE WORD, POSSIBILITY. THAT IN AMERICA EVERYONE SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO AS FAR AS THEIR DREAM AND GOD-GIVEN ABILITY WILL TAKE THEM. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AHEAD, AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT IS FREER AND MORE JUST, THAT TREATS JOBS WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT, AN AMERICA THAT CURES DISEASES LIKE CANCER AND ALZHEIMER, AN AMERICA THAT NEVER LEAVES ANYONE BEHIND. AHEAD TO AN AMERICA THAT NEVER GIVES UP, NEVER GIVES IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS A GREAT NATION. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BAD BET TO BET AGAINST AMERICA. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHEN WE HAVE DONE IT TOGETHER. FOLKS, IN THE LAST STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN, I BEGAN THINKING ABOUT A HYNMN THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME AND MY FAMILY THAT CAPTURES THE FAITH THAT SUSTAINS ME AND WHICH I BELIEVE SUSTAINS AMERICA. AND I HOPE IT CAN PROVIDE COMFORT AND SOLEMN TO THE AMERICANS WHO LOST A LOVED ONE TO THIS TERRIBLE VIRUS THIS YEAR. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. HOPEFULLY THIS HYMN GIVES YOU SOLEMN. IT GOES LIKE THIS , AND HE WILL RAISE YOU UP ON EAGLE'S WINGS, AND MAKE YOU A SIGN LIKE THE SUN AND HOLD YOU IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. TOGETHER ON EAGLE'S WINGS WE EMBARK ON THE WORK GOD CALLED UPON US TO DO WITH FULL HEARTS AND STEADY HANDS, WITH FAITH IN AMERICA AND IN EACH OTHER, WITH LOVE OF COUNTRY, A THIRST FOR JUSTICE. LET IT BE THE NATION THAT WE KNOW WE CAN BE, A NATION UNITED, A NATION STRENGTHENED, A NATION HEALED. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING WE HAVE TRIED AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. REMEMBER, AS OUR GRANDPOP SAID WHEN WE WALKED OUT OF OUR HOME, HE SAID JOE, KEEP THE FAITH. OUR GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE SAID NO, SPREAD THE FAITH. MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA AND MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS. THANK YOU.

VICE PRESIDENT ELECT, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS, SPOKE AT A RALLY MONDAY IN COLUMBUS, GEORGIA IN SUPPORT OF JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. BOTH CANDIDATES ARE IN THE JANUARY 5 RUNOFF IN GEORGIA. THIS RUNS 50 MINUTES. HELLO, COLUMBUS GEORGIA. YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE READY TO WIN AN ELECTION. IS THAT RIGHT? WE WANT TO SAY TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY, WELCOME TO THE NEW GEORGIA. WELCOME TO THE BLUE GEORGIA. GEORGIA, THEY DID NOT SEE YOU COMING, BUT HERE WE ARE. HERE IS , SHE ISN'T IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE, VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT KAMALA HARRIS. [CAR HORNS HONKING] I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT. YOU FLIPPED THIS STATE BLUE. AND COME JANUARY 5 WHEN YOU SEND ME AN JON OSSOFF TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, WE ARE GOING TO SEAL THE DEAL. [CAR HORNS HONKING] SO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 5. DON'T LET UP FOR ONE DAY. JANUARY 5 IS ELECTION DAYFUL BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WE SHOULD NO LONGER BE TALKING ABOUT ELECTION DAY. THERE'S NO SUCH THING. IT'S ELECTION SEASON. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 5. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. ICE STORM IN GEORGIA, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN TROUBLE. SO START VOTING NOW. DURING THIS EARLY VOTING PERIOD THAT GOES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, MAKE VOTING PART OF YOUR HOLIDAY PLAN. DON'T WAIT. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE. BECAUSE THE FOUR MOST POWERFUL WORDS EVER UTTERED IN A DEMOCRACY ARE, "THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN." AND ON NOVEMBER 3, YOU SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR. AND YOU SENT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITH GEORGIA'S 16 ELECTORAL VOTES. WE KNOW THEY WON, BECAUSE WE COUNTED THEM. HA. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. AND THEN WE COUNTED THEM AGAIN. CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? [CAR HORNS HONKING] BUT THEY WILL NEED HELP. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MOMENT IS ALL ABOUT. THAT YOU WOULD SEND JON OSSOFF AND MYSELF, THAT YOU WOULD GIVE US THE GREAT HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF THE GREATEST STATE IN THE UNION, THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THE HOME STATE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN WHOSE PULPIT I'M HONORED TO PREACH FROM EVERY SUNDAY AS PASTOR OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH, SPIRITUAL HOME OF DR. KING AND THE GREAT JOHN LEWIS WHO WOULD BE TELLING US RIGHT NOW, VOTE LIKE YOU'VE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. AND I'M HONORED JUST TO BE A PART OF THIS EFFORT. I REALLY AM. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHATEVER I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE, I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN WHERE I CAME FROM. I WAS RAISED IN PUBLIC HOUSING. ONE OF 12 CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY, I'M NUMBER 11. 12 KIDS. MY FOLKS ARE PREACHERS AND THEY CLEARLY READ THE BIBLE, BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY. I'M THE FIRST GRADUATE OF A FOUR-YEAR INSTITUTION IN MY FAMILY. MOREHOUSE COLLEGE. I GOT THERE THROUGH HARD WORK, GRIT AND DETERMINATION. BUT I GOT THERE BECAUSE SOMEBODY GAVE ME SOME PELL GRANTS AND SOME LOW-INTEREST STUDENT LOANS. AND I'M RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR KIDS GROWING UP IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES THAN IT WAS FOR ME ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME, YOU SEE AN ITERATION AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE AMERICAN STORY. BECAUSE I GREW UP IN PUBLIC HOUSING. MY MAMA IS FROM WAYCROSS, GEORGIA. THAT'S WAY ACROSS GEORGIA. SHE GREW UP IN THE 1950'S AND AS A BLACK TEENAGER, SHE SPENT MANY SUMMERS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON. SHE SPENT MANY DAYS PICKING SOMEBODY ELSE'S TOBACCO. BUT THE OTHER DAY, THOSE 82-YEAR-OLD HANDS THAT USED TO PICK SOMEBODY ELSE'S COTTON PICKED HER YOUNGEST SON TO BE OUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. [CAR HORNS HONKING] THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT AMERICA. I LOVE AMERICA BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT COUNTRY THAT GIVES US THE POWER TO MAKE IT GREATER AND THE WAY WE MAKE IT GREATER IS FOR THE PEOPLE TO STAND UP. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN. THIS IS OUR DEMOCRACY. IT DOESN'T BELONG TO THE POLITICIANS. IT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. AT OUR PLEASURE. SO I'M DEEPLY HONORED. THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE'VE GOT TO PASS COVID-19 RELIEF. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE AT THE CENTER OF ANY RELIEF THAT WE PROVIDE. WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT ORDINARY PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS. FOR OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND OUR FIRE MEN AND FIRE WOMEN. WE'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT FOR THOSE WHO PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US, WHO RISK THEIR LIVES BY SAVING LIVES EVERY DAY. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS VACCINE DISTRIBUTED SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES DON'T FIND THEMSELVES AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ISN'T IT INTERESTING, THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE TOO OFTEN IGNORED, REFUSED TO PAY A LIVABLE WAGE, THIS PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US OF HOW IMPORTANT THEY REALLY ARE. THE FOLK WHO STOCK GROCERY STORE SHELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE MANY OF US ARE ASLEEP. THE FOLK WHO KEEP THE ECONOMY HUMMING. WE NOW CALL THEM ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WELL, IF THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND INDEED THEY ARE, WE OUGHT TO PAY THEM AN ESSENTIAL WAGE AND PROVIDE TO THEM ESSENTIAL MEDICINE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] IT'S ONLY RIGHT. AND WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT. AND MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERYBODY. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON THE PLANET CAN AND OUGHT TO PROVIDE FOR ALL THE CITIZENS. WE CAN DO IT. WE JUST HAVE TO COMMIT TO DOING IT. I'VE BEEN MOVING ALL ACROSS THIS STATE, DROPPING BY LITTLE TOWNS, AND WHEN I GO INTO THESE SMALL, RURAL TOWNS, THEY'RE SURPRISED THAT I'M THERE. I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE SURPRISED. THEY SAY REVEREND, WE'RE NOT USED TO SOMEONE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE COMING BY OUR LITTLE TOWN. THAT'S STRANGE TO ME BECAUSE I'M RUNNING TO BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF GEORGIA. AND TOO MANY OF OUR RURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. WE'VE HAD NINE HOSPITALS CLOSE IN THIS STATE IN 10 YEARS BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO EXPEND MEDICAID. , EXPAND MEDICAID. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR OR TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS WHO BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT, WHO WILL STRENGTHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND WHO WILL MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE FROM HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. GEORGIA DESERVES A UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN KIDS COME OUT OF SCHOOL, THEY SHOULD NOT BE SO BURDENED WITH COLLEGE DEBT THAT THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE BEFORE THEY HAVE A MORTGAGE. THEN, WE'VE GOT TO INVEST IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT WILL CREATE BROADBAND IN THESE RURAL AREAS, REPAIR OUR ROADS AND OUR BRIDGES AND OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OUR BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A REFLECTION OF OUR BROKEN POLITICS AND WE MUST RISE UP IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICA AND REPAIR ROADS AND BRIDGE, REPAIR OUR DEMOCRACY FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND WE CAN DO IT. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO STAND TOGETHER. SO PUSH HARD NOW. IN THESE REMAINING COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND PUSH BACK AGAINST THE FORCES THAT TRY TO DIVIDE US. HAVE YOU NOTICED, I'M TRYING TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, AND MY OPPONENT IS TRYING TO REDUCE THIS RACE TO THE KIND OF EMPTY SCHOOLYARD INSULTS MADE BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO AREN'T THINKING VERY CAREFULLY ON A PLAYGROUND. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND SHE'S BUSY CALLING ME NAMES. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A DEBATE AND SHE'S ENGAGED IN NAME CALLING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, AS WE SAY IN THE SOUTH, BLESS HER HEART. SHE CAN CALL ME WHATEVER SHE WANTS. HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE CAN PROVIDE IT IN THE RICHEST NATION ON THE PLANET. I BELIEVE THAT SENIORS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING FOOD AND BUYING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY DESERVE A LIVABLE WAGE. SHE CAN CALL THAT WHATEVER SHE WANTS. I CALL IT COMMON SENSE. AND SO HERE'S THE THING. I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. WE THE PEOPLE CAN DO IT. THAT IS THE COVENANT WE HAVE WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE WE? WE ARE THOSE WHO WORK HARD EVERY DAY AND CAN BARELY GET BY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE HEART, BUT WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO WORK TO MAKE OTHERS RICH BUT WE CAN BARELY MAKE THE RENT. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO ARE TRYING TO STRUGGLE AND MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE AND TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND VOCATIONAL SCHOOL SO WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GREAT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WE THE PEOPLE. WE WHO , WE WHO ARE DOING OK ECONOMICALLY. BUT DEEP IN OUR HEART, WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS. SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED. AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN FIX IT IN THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING AS I CLOSE AND NOBODY BELIEVES A BAPTIST PREACHER WHEN HE SAYS "AS I CLOSE." THEY SAY HE'S GOT AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MORE CLOSERS. BUT I'M HONESTLY, AS I CLOSE. MY DAD USED TO WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING BECAUSE HE HAD A SERIOUS WORK ETHIC. HE WAS A VETERAN. LEARNED EARLY TO WAKE UP EARLY AND GET STARTED. HE WAS A PASTOR AND HE WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN. HE HAD THINGS TO HANDLE. SO IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM WHETHER IT WAS A SCHOOL DAY OR SUMMERTIME. OR SATURDAY. HE WOKE ME UP SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, OFTEN AT DAWN. HE HAD A WAY OF SAYING, SON, GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES ON, GET READY. HE DIDN'T THINK YOU SHOULD SLEEP LATE OR WALK AROUND, YOU KNOW, UNPREPARED. SO HE SAID GET UP, GET DRESSED, PUT YOUR SHOES, GET READY. I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SO I ASKED HIM, DAD, IT'S SATURDAY. AND YOU KNOW, I'M 7, 10 YEARS OLD. GET READY FOR WHAT? SOMETIMES I'D STOP HIM, HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW, I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT LATER. YOU JUST BE READY. PUT YOUR SHOES ON, SON. HE'D WAKE ME UP AT DAWN. AND THE THING ABOUT DAWN IS THAT IT IS MORNING BUT IT'S STILL DARK. IT'S DARK. BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. SO I WANT TO SAY TO YOU COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, AMERICA, THAT I KNOW IT'S DARK BUT MORNING IS ON THE WAY. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMES IN THE MORNING. ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION? [CAR HORNS HONKING] GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! CALL EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. TELL THEM IT'S TIME TO VOTE LIKE WE NEVER VOTED BEFORE. GET UP! GET DRESSED! PUT YOUR SHOES ON! GET READY! UNTIL WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, UNTIL WE HAVE A LIVABLE WAGE, LET'S FIGHT TOGETHER, LET'S STRUGGLE TOGETHER, LET'S STAY TOGETHER, LET'S PRAY TOGETHER, LET'S MERGE TOGETHER AND TOGETHER WE WIN. GOD BLESS YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, Y'ALL. HELLO, COLUMBUS. COLUMBUS, GIVE IT UP AGAIN FOR MY FRIEND, REVEREND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. COLUMBUS, IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR COMING OUT. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU FOR HOW HARD YOU'RE WORKING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING TO WELCOME THE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES, KAMALA HARRIS. [CAR HORNS HONKING] COLUMBUS, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WATCHING GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WATCHING GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. ALL EYES ON GEORGIA. AND COLUMBUS, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA, NOW THE MOST COMPETITIVE BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. HOSTING TWO U.S. SENATE RUNOFFS FOR CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME, COLUMBUS, THAT YOUR STANDARD BEARERS ARE THE YOUNG JEWISH SON OF AN IMMIGRANT MENTORED BY JOHN LEWIS AND A BLACK PREACHER WHO HOLDS DR. KING'S PULPIT AT EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH. COLUMBUS, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE COME. GOOD TROUBLE. AND WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST LIKE THE BONNIE AND CLYDE OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS. COLUMBUS, HOW DID WE WIND UP WITH KELLY AND DAVID? HOW DID WE WIND UP WITH KELLY AND DAVID? TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS MORE CONCERNED WITH USING THEIR OFFICES TO LINE THEIR OWN POCKETS THAN LOOKING OUT FOR WE THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES. WE DESERVE BETTER, COLUMBUS, AND RETIREMENT IS COMING FOR KELLY LOEFFLER AND DAVID PERDUE. WE HAVE THE POWER, COLUMBUS. WE HAVE THE POWER TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE HAVE BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS TO DISCUSS THAN DAVID PERDUE AND KELLY LEFFLER, LIKE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. GEORGIA HAS THE POWER TO DECIDE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. WE HAVE THE POWER TO WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY , BECAUSE THE FOG IS LIFTING. DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING. HE MAY NOT KNOW IT YET, BUT DONALD TRUMP IS LEAVING AND GEORGIA VOTERS SENT DONALD TRUMP PACKING. YOU DID THAT. SO WHAT COMES NEXT IS UP TO US. AND COLUMBUS, WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT FOR HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH, COLUMBUS. DO YOU BELIEVE, LIKE I DO AND LIKE REV. WARNOCK DOES, THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT OR LIVE IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE GEORGIAN DESERVES THE VERY BEST HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE ON EARTH? WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I WAS JUST OUT AND CUSTOMER, GEORGIA THREE DAYS AGO , CASPER, GEORGIA THREE DAYS AGO. THEY LOST THEIR HOSPITAL IN OCTOBER IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. THEIR HOSPITAL CLOSED DOWN. DAVID PERDUE AND REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO EXPAND MEDICAID ARE RESPONSIBLE. WE'VE LOST NINE RURAL HOSPITALS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. IF YOU SEND ME AND REV. WARNOCK TO THE SENATE, WE WILL DELIVER THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN THOSE HOSPITALS. WE BELIEVE HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE. WE CAN STAND UP TO THE INSURANCE AND DRUG COMPANIES THAT ARE RIPPING OFF GEORGIA FAMILIES EVERY DAY. SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS THAT ARRIVE SIX MONTHS AFTER A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL. THE PRICES THAT FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO PAY AT THE PHARMACY EVERY DAY FOR LIFESAVING MEDICINES LIKE INSULIN. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY AND WE CAN FIX IT. WE CAN MAKE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IN REALITY FOR EVERY FAMILY IN THIS STATE, BECAUSE COLUMBUS HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOT JUST A PRIVILEGE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. THIS IS ABOUT HEALTH AND JOBS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS, COLUMBUS. WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO PASS THE MOST AMBITIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE AND JOBS AND ECONOMIC RELIEF PLAN IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BUILD BACK OUR ECONOMY AFTER THIS CRISIS. WE CAN REPAIR OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES. WE CAN BUILD THOSE CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. YOU CAN UPGRADE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE CAN ENSURE EVERY COMMUNITY IN GEORGIA HAS HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS. WE CAN MAKE GEORGIA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH AND AMERICA THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WORLD. WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, COLUMBUS. WE CAN CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS WHILE WE DO IT. WE CAN RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15, BECAUSE AN HONEST WEEK'S WORK SHOULD NOT JUST ALLOW US TO SURVIVE, IT SHOULD ALLOW US TO THRIVE. WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS, COLUMBUS. BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE STAKES OF THESE ELECTIONS. BECAUSE IF MITCH MCCONNELL CONTINUES TO CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE, HE WILL TRY TO DO TO JOE AND KAMALA JUST LIKE WHAT HE TRIED TO DO TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. THEY WILL BLOCK THE COVID RELIEF , MINIMUM WAGE, THEY WILL BLOCK THE EXPANSION OF PELL GRANT THAT WOULD ALLOW EVERY YOUNG PERSON IN THIS STATE TO GET A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE WITHOUT A PENNY OF DEBT. WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO, COLUMBUS, TO BE MIRED IN GRIDLOCK AND OBSTRUCTION. WE HAVE TOO MUCH GOOD WORK TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. COLUMBUS, THE POLLS ARE OPEN RIGHT NOW. THE POLLS ARE OPEN RIGHT NOW. SO COLUMBUS, SAY IT WITH ME NOW, SAY VOTE. THE POLLS ARE OPEN, COLUMBUS. HEALTH, JOBS, AND JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT JUSTICE. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS AN IMMIGRANT WHEN SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN THE IDEAS THAT AMERICA STANDS FOR. THE IDEAS THAT SO MANY HAVE FOUGHT AND SACRIFICED FOR. COLUMBUS, PLEASE JOIN ME IN TAKING A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE VETERANS AND ALL OF THE MILITARY FAMILIES WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. MY MOTHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN THE IDEAS THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN SHE INDULGED SOME KIND OF FANTASY ABOUT HER PAST. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH FURTHER THIS COUNTRY HAD TO GO. BUT SHE BELIEVED, LIKE THE REVEREND WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, THAT THIS IS A COUNTRY ON A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS. THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS WHAT EMPOWERS US TO BUILD THIS COUNTRY SO THAT WE FULLY REALIZE OUR FOUNDING IDEALS OF EQUALITY IN GOD'S EYES AND EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT. THE BALLOT BOX IS WHERE WE DEMAND THAT PROGRESS. THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN. COLUMBUS, SAY IT WITH ME AGAIN, SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE 14TH AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION ALREADY GUARANTEES EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. BUT WHEN AHMAUD ARBERY IS SHOT TO DEATH IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON CAMERA ON THE STREET AND THE AUTHORITIES LOOK THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE HE IS A YOUNG BLACK MAN, THAT MAKES A MOCKERY OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. COLUMBUS, ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT FOR A NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL SECURE EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL, REGARDLESS OF RACE, AND REGARDLESS OF CLASS? AND A NEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT WILL PROTECT THE SACRED FRANCHISE AND AND VOTER SUPPRESSION? COLUMBUS, WE HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THE NEXT TWO YEARS CAN BE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS SINCE 1964 AND 1965. WE HAVE THE POWER AS GEORGIA VOTERS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. WE HAVE TO ORGANIZE AND MOBILIZE AND WORK LIKE WE HAVE NEVER WORKED BEFORE. COLUMBUS, ARE YOU READY TO PUT IN THE WORK THESE NEXT TWO WEEKS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN? ARE YOU READY TO KNOCK ON DOORS AND CALL YOUR NEIGHBORS AND GET EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AT SCHOOL AND CHURCH AND WORK AT THE POLLS? SAY VOTE. SAY VOTE. COLUMBUS, JOIN ME ONCE AGAIN IN THANKING THE REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK FOR RUNNING FOR OFFICE. COLUMBUS, JOIN ME AGAIN AND WELCOMING THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS. COLUMBUS, LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER. LET'S DO IT FROM A PLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION AND DECENCY AND UNITY. WE ARE TURNING THE PAGE ON FOUR YEARS OF HATRED AND FEAR AND DIVISION AND RACISM. LET'S BE FILLED WITH LOVE FOR EACH OTHER AS WE DO THIS WORK. LET'S BUILD THE KIND OF COUNTRY WE WANT TO LEAVE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE, GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE DOING. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. (music) GREETINGS, EVERYONE. I FIRST JUST WANT TO SAY HOW HONORED AND SO IN OUR I AM TO BE HERE AND INTRODUCE OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT. I KNOW THAT YOU ARE DIDN'T JUST COME HERE TO SEE VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT HARRIS, BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALSO HERE BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING. YOU UNDERSTOOD IT IN NOVEMBER WHEN YOU VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS. SHOUT OUT TO GEORGIA'S YOUNG VOTERS, WHO WERE NUMBER ONE IN THE COUNTRY. EARLY VOTING HAS BEGUN IN OUR STATE AND I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR VOICE AND YOUR VOTE NOW. WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS, GEORGIA. THESE TWO SENATE RACES ARE SO VERY CRITICAL FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE. IN THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT HARRIS, WE ARE DETERMINING THE SOUL OF AMERICA. TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING, OUR VICE PRESIDENT ELECT IS A LIVING IMAGE OF AMERICA'S VOICE. PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN WITHOUT A SILVER SPOON, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO FIGHT FOR AND EARN THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. PEOPLE OF COLOR, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. WOMEN, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. AMERICA, OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS YOU. COLUMBUS, GEORGIA, PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME THE FIRST FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, KAMALA HARRIS. (music) V.P.-ELECT HARRIS: COLUMBUS! WHAT'S UP, COLUMBUS? [LAUGHTER] WHERE DID YOU GO? HOW ABOUT BJ TILLMAN? CAN WE PLEASE GIVE IT UP FOR HER? I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SHE DOES NOT DO BECAUSE SHE DOES EVERYTHING. SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE LEADER. SHE THREW THIS CAMPAIGN UP TO NOVEMBER, WAS ORGANIZING FOLKS, EVERYONE FROM YOUNG STUDENTS TO THE YOUNGER OF THE ELDEST OF US, SHE HAS BEEN ORGANIZING PEOPLE AND STILL CONTINUES TO BE SUCH A LEADER. WHEN I LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE BJ, I KNOW OUR FUTURE IS BRIGHT. LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR HER. ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN GEORGIA. IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK IN GEORGIA. AND I AM HERE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, TO THANK YOU ALL ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF FOR DOING WHAT YOU DID IN NOVEMBER. BECAUSE YOU DID WHAT NO ONE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE, YOU DID WHAT NO ONE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE. YOU MADE A STATEMENT, NOT ONLY ABOUT WHO IS GEORGIA, WHAT IS THE VOICE OF GEORGIA, WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES OF GEORGIA, WHAT GEORGIA WILL NOT ALLOWED TO BE DENIED ABOUT GEORGIA, BUT YOU ALSO MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. YOU ALLOWED PEOPLE AROUND THIS NATION TO SAY, UH-HUH, DON'T EVER PUT US IN A BOX AND TELL US WHO WE ARE. WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID RIGHT HERE IN COLUMBUS. SO, I AM HERE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, ON BEHALF OF JOE BIDEN AND MYSELF TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID. OF COURSE, NO GOOD THANK YOU COMES WITHOUT ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. [] LAUGHTER] JANUARY 5, GENERALLY FIFTH. 2020 HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT YEAR. 2020 HAS BEEN ROUGH. PEOPLE MAKING JOKES ABOUT 2020, LIKE WE WANT THIS THING TO BE OVER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, GEORGIA, COLUMBUS, 2020 IS NOT OVER UNTIL JANUARY 5. THAT'S 12020 WILL BE OVER. THAT'S WHEN WE WILL GET THIS THING DONE. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEED TO ELECT REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, TO ELECT JON OSSOFF, TO ELECT DANIEL BLACKMAN, EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE. EVERYTHING THAT WAS AT STAKE IN NOVEMBER IS AT STAKE LEADING UP TO JANUARY 5. LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THIS STATE. WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT SO MUCH DEVASTATION, PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS, LOST TIME BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK, LOST TIME IN TERMS OF OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND THE DAYS OF THEIR EDUCATION THEY HAVE MISSED. THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH LOSS THESE YEARS, AND IN PARTICULAR THIS YEAR. IN GEORGIA, ONE IN SEVEN FAMILIES IS DESCRIBING THEIR HOUSEHOLD AS BEING HUNGRY. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUNGER CRISIS IN AMERICA AND IT IS HITTING GEORGIA HARD. ONE IN SEVEN DESCRIBING HUNGER IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD. ONE IN SIX GEORGIA FAMILIES ARE DESCRIBING AN INABILITY OR DIFFICULTY TO PAY RENT. ONE IN FOUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN GEORGIA HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IS OR ARE ABOUT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND WHAT WE ARE HERE TO TALK ABOUT AND WHY EVERYONE, ALTHOUGH LEADERS, ARE HERE RIGHT NOW TOGETHER, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE HERE, YOU'RE A LEADER, IS TO SAY THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR VOICES HEARD, WE WILL NOT LET ANYONE SILENCE US. WE WILL SPEAK UP ABOUT WHAT WE NEED. WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE WANT AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN THROUGH OUR VOTES. AND JUST LIKE YOU DID, YOU WOULD DO IT AGAIN , WILL DO IT AGAIN. HERE'S THE THING. I WAS HERE, JOE BIDEN WAS HERE, WE WERE ALL HERE TOGETHER IN GEORGIA BEFORE NOVEMBER. REMEMBER HOW WE KNEW WHAT WAS AT STAKE AND THE CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US? WE KNEW, LIKE STACEY ABRAMS HAS BEEN TELLING US AND ORGANIZING, THAT THERE THAT WOULD TRY TO PREVENT US FROM VOTING. WE KNEW THE KINDS OF GAMES THAT THEY WOULD PLAY TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUPPRESS OUR VOTES, TO MAKE IT CONFUSING, TO DISCOURAGE US. IN NOVEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND WE SAID WE KNEW THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US. THE SAME CHALLENGE EXISTS TODAY. WE AGAIN ASK, AS IT RELATES TO JANUARY 5, THE QUESTION WE ASKED IN NOVEMBER, WHY ARE SO MANY POWERFUL PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO VOTE? WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY. WE KNOW THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THEY KNOW OUR POWER. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, THINGS CHANGE. THEY KNOW WHEN WE VOTE, WE WIN! SO, WHAT WE DID IN NOVEMBER, WE CAN DO AGAIN, BECAUSE IT COMES FROM A VERY DEEP PLACE INSIDE OF US. UNDERSTANDING, THIS IS NOT ABOUT A DAMN, THIS IS NOT ABOUT A GESTURE, THIS IS ABOUT OUR LIVES. THIS IS ABOUT THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN, THE LIFE OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR NATION. NOW, YOU ALL KNOW I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOUR YEARS AGO. BITTERSWEET NIGHT, THE SAME NIGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED. I WAS ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, BECOMING ONLY THE SECOND BLACK WOMAN IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO BE ELECTED. ONLY THE SECOND. I AM CURRENTLY THE ONLY BLACK WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND HERE'S WHAT I HAVE ALSO COME TO VISIT WITH YOU TO SHARE. THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN THAT BODY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THERE ARE ONLY 100 SENATORS. THEY CALLED THE UNITED STATES SENATE THE MOST DELIBERATIVE BODY IN THE WORLD. THEY ELECT PEOPLE, WE ELECT PEOPLE FOR SIX YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, BECAUSE THE JOB IS SO IMPORTANT AND POTENTIALLY SO POWERFUL AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING THE STATE AS A WHOLE THAT WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND A VOICE FOR THEIR STATE IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY LEADERS FOR THEIR STATE, BUT NATIONAL LEADERS. IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHERE I WENT TO THE FLOOR, THEY CALL IT THE WELL OF THE SENATE, IT IS A GRAND BUILDING, THE UNITED STATES CAPITAL, IT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE WOOD PANELING HAS BEEN THERE FOREVER, PRISTINE DESKS. YOU CAN SEE THE NAMES OF THE FOUNDERS OF OUR DEMOCRACY WRITTEN IN THOSE DESKS. AND I SAT ON THAT FLOOR WHEN THE REPUBLICANS WERE TRYING TO GET RID OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT THEY NAMED OBAMACARE THAT BROUGHT HEALTH CARE TO TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. I WATCHED AS THEY DARE TO PLAY POLITICS WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEIR WELL-BEING. AND I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES, I WAS RELATIVELY NEW TO THE SENATE, I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THE POWER OF EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNITED STATES SENATORS. IT IS INCREDIBLE. AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT POWER, I SAW WHAT YOU PROBABLY SAW BY TELEVISION. IN THE EARLY MORNING, LATE AT NIGHT, EARLY MORNING HOURS ON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, I SAW THE POWER OF JUST ONE SENATOR WHEN THE LATE, GREAT JOHN MCCAIN ON THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA, TOGETHER WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BROUGHT IT, SO HE WANTED TO ATTACK IT. I SAW THE POWER OF ONE SENATOR WHEN JOHN MCCAIN TOOK TO THAT FLOOR AND SAID, NO YOU DON'T. HE SAID, NO YOU DON'T. [CAR HORNS HONKING] POWER OF JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL. AND GEORGIA, COLUMBUS, YOU'VE GOT THE POWER TO SEND TWO. IT IS WITHIN YOUR HANDS, WITHIN OUR GRASP TO SEND THESE TWO LEADERS TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR VOICE. THEY ARE BORN OUT OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE, WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO SILENCE AND SUPPRESS YOU. BUT THEY WERE TRIUMPHANT, THEY WERE BORN OUT OF THIS ELECTION CYCLE WHEN PEOPLE DARED TO TRY AND HAVE US COUNT THREE TIMES YOUR VOTES. AND THEY ARE HERE TO TELL THE STORY. THEY ARE BORN OUT OF A MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE DARED FROM OTHER STATES LIKE TEXAS TO RECALL YOUR VOTES AND YOUR VOICE. BUT THEY LIVED TO TELL THE STORY. THEY ARE STRONG. THEY HAVE SURVIVED THESE GAMES PEOPLE ARE PLAYING BECAUSE THEY ARE THE STRONG VOICES OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE. SO, WE HAVE GOT IT WITHIN OUR POWER AND YOU HAVE IT WITHIN YOUR HANDS TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT WHO IS GEORGIA. AND THE POWER OF THE VOICE OF GEORGIA SENDING THESE TWO, JON OSSOFF AND RAFAEL WARNOCK, TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SAY, IT IS US, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, WHO WILL MAKE A DECISION. IT WILL NOT BE MADE FOR US. WE WILL MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHO REPRESENTS US. [CAR HORNS HONKING] SO, LET'S GET THIS DONE. LET'S GET THIS DONE. YOU KNOW, I AM NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST, BUT I AM HERE TO SAY THAT THE DECISION YOU MAKE, THE WORK YOU PUT INTO IT WILL IMPACT PEOPLE WHO YOU MAY NEVER MEET. PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER KNOW YOUR NAMES, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND ARE PREPARED TO DO, THEIR LIVES WILL FOREVER BE BETTER. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS SLOGAN THAT IS ABOUT HEALTH, JOBS, JUSTICE, THAT REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICES IN AMERICA THAT MUST BE HEARD CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. RAFAEL AND JON WILL DO THAT. THEY WILL DO THAT. THIS WILL NOT BE EASY. AND IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IN THE SENATE WHICH IS WHAT THIS ELECTION WILL DO. IT RELATES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICARE, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION. JOE BIDEN AND I HAVE SAYING, LOOK, IN PLACES LIKE IN COLUMBUS, UP AND DOWN GEORGIA, WE GOT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE LOWEST TAX BASE AND BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS STILL KIND OF MESSED UP, WE FUND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON THE TAX BASE OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS THAT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDS, THEY OFTEN HAVE THE FEWEST RESOURCES. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT JOE AND I PLAN TO DO THAT IS TO TRIPLE TITLE ONE FUNDING. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WE NEED RAFAEL AND JON IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SEE THAT THROUGH. WE TALK ABOUT RESPECTING THE NEED OF ALL AMERICANS TO HAVE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE THE DIGNITY OF BEING ABLE TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES KNOWING THAT THEIR HARD WORK PAYS OFF. SO JOE AND I HAVE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS GET A $15,000 TAX CREDIT TO BE ABLE TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT OR CLOSING COSTS TO BUY A HOME. WE NEED THE SUPPORT AND THE VOTES TO DO THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE'VE GOT TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW HERE IN GEORGIA, OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, OUR BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES ARE PART OF THE ECONOMIC LIFE BLOOD OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE CLOSING. PART OF HOW WE GOT TO GET DEALING WITH THIS MOVING FORWARD IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON OUR MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITOL SO JOE AND I GOT A PLAN FOR THAT. WE NEED THE VOTES IN THE SENATE. WE NEED RAFAEL AND JON THERE. [CAR HORNS HONKING] WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS IT RELATES TO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW, THOSE WORDS ARE INSCRIBED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL MARBLE BUILDING CALLED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, IT'S AN IDEAL THAT WE KNOW WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE FOLKS WHO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF REFORMING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, REFORMING POLICING, DOING WHAT MUST BE DONE TO SAY LET US BAN CHOKE HOLDS AND CAROTID HOLDS, GEORGE FLOYD WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. LET'S HAVE A NATIONAL STANDARD OF USE OF FORCE. LET US REQUIRE THAT AS A NATION WE RUN OUR LAWS IN A WAY THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REAL HISTORY OF AMERICA AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO RIGHT WHAT HAS BEEN WRONG, TO DO THAT, WE WILL NEED THE LEGISLATION TO BE PASSED. WE WILL NEED JON AND RAFAEL IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE AT STAKE. AND SO I TRAVELED HERE, I GOT TO GO BACK AND VOTE ON THAT COVID PACKAGE TONIGHT IN D.C. [CAR HORNS HONKING] AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT, BUT I WANTED TO COME AND VISIT WITH YOU BEFORE CHRISTMAS, BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO ASK THAT AMONG THE THINGS THAT YOU PLAN TO DO FOR CHRISTMAS, WE ALL HAVE OUR TRADITIONS, SO MANY OF US, OUR TRADITIONS HAVE BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE VIRUS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE SAFE, BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS SEASON, IN THE SPIRIT OF THE CELEBRATION OF A BIRTH THAT TAUGHT US THAT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO LEAVE THIS WORLD BETTER THAN WE FOUND IT, LET US USE THOSE DAYS LEADING UP TO JANUARY 5 IN THE SPIRIT OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT, TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE WE KNOW UNDERSTANDS THEIR POWER, THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE. AND MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. 2020, YOU KNOW, WE GOT ALL KINDS OF WORDS FOR IT, MOST OF WHICH WE SHOULD NOT SAY IN FRONT OF CHILDREN, AND LIKE I SAID, I THINK 2020 WILL TRULY BE OVER ON JANUARY 5 AND THAT BEING SAID, COLUMBUS, THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT WILL PASS. THIS MOMENT OF LOSS, THIS MOMENT OF SO MANY CRISES HITTING SO HARD, IT WILL PASS AND YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN, OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND OTHERS WILL LOOK IN OUR EYES, EACH ONE OF US. THEY'LL LOOK IN OUR EYES AND THEY WILL ASK US, WHERE WERE YOU AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME? WHERE WERE YOU? AND WHAT I KNOW WE ALL WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THEM IS SO MUCH MORE THAN HOW WE FELT AT THIS MOMENT. WE WILL TELL THEM WHAT WE DID. WE WILL TELL THEM WE WERE HANGING OUT AT BIG MOUNTAIN, THAT WE WERE HANGING OUT WITH JON AND RAFAEL, KAMALA CAME AND PAID US A VISIT. WE WILL TELL THEM THAT WE ORGANIZED, THAT WE REMINDED PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY AND WE WILL TELL THEM WE ELECTED THE NEXT SENATORS TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT IS WHAT WE WILL TELL THEM! THANK YOU, COLUMBUS! THANK YOU!
